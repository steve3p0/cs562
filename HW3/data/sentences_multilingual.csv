6256955,eng,I think doing that would be fun.

18536,eng,Just because a man is rich it does not necessarily follow that he is happy.
680331,eng,Tom is balancing on a tightrope.
6509577,eng,It sounds like Tom and Mary want to do that.
6493001,eng,Tom and Mary didn't feel they should do what the other children were doing.
410601,eng,"You really are lucky, aren't you?"
6957995,eng,"I could see that she hated me and feared me, and when the thought of it drove me to drink, then she despised me as well."

6272931,eng,Both of them did that.

7384073,eng,He paid someone to do that for him.
6253528,eng,Tom lives with his family in Boston.
7209195,eng,Please put the milk back in the refrigerator.
7186114,eng,I'm sorry that you had to get dragged into this.
5909318,eng,It looks like Tom is having a hard time doing that.
1961739,eng,I thought you were going to be at the party last night.
2390825,eng,I really don't want anything to eat right now.
7177982,eng,Tom said that Mary thought he might not have to do that.
7472869,eng,They swore that they wouldn't do that again.
7389768,eng,He left his umbrella at our place.
6064902,eng,Aren't you ever going to leave?
1460025,eng,"Unfortunately, it's raining today."
5296254,eng,That is impossible for me.
7272607,eng,Sami's parents have decided to divorce.
308161,eng,I received a letter from her to the effect that she couldn't accept my marriage proposal.
6818512,eng,"Somebody could've followed us, I suppose."
2546015,eng,I'm glad that's settled.
6652881,eng,Tom said he thought that he knew what Mary had to do.
3916583,eng,I've got no secrets from them.
692451,eng,Should I wait for you tomorrow in front of the opera house?
7150481,eng,We lived in Boston before we moved to Australia.
3312595,eng,We tried it your way last time and it didn't work.
52470,eng,Singapore has one big problem.

2288910,eng,Don't ask me to explain it.
5849995,eng,I seldom listen to music at home.
2333014,eng,She gave me something.
7177810,eng,Tom said that Mary thought she might not be allowed to do that by herself.
7513573,eng,Tom said that didn't sound logical to him.
286639,eng,His letter makes me uneasy.
240024,eng,Cold calls are the primary function of the telemarketing department.
4497698,eng,Tom offered to help us do that.
7438878,eng,They said that they're feeling nervous.
6408688,eng,Mary probably just didn't know she was supposed to do that.
7107968,eng,The new tax marginalizes poor people.
3181513,eng,"You should talk to Tom, too."
2141488,eng,"Thanks to you, I have problems with my blood pressure."
278418,eng,Mail order is the main form of direct marketing.
7117819,eng,I never expected things would turn out like this.
32923,eng,"Mike visited Mr Ogaki, who is our principal."
2541531,eng,I told you to stay away from me.
4890588,eng,Tom just got out of rehab.
4894999,eng,"Let's all raise our glasses and give a toast to our special guest, eh?"
6229393,eng,Tom wouldn't have asked you for help if he could've done it by himself.
5979445,eng,I will take that as a compliment.
6496584,eng,Tom and Mary didn't have enough money to buy what they needed.
311910,eng,She fastened the clasp of her necklace.
6258967,eng,Tom hoped he'd be able to do that.
6812147,eng,I think that you know Tom already.
2367440,eng,The eternal city - that's Rome; the perpetual building site - that's Berlin.
295835,eng,He makes it a rule never to speak badly of others.
5085311,eng,Even small amounts of lead are dangerous.
1993393,eng,I'm meeting her this evening.
6270864,eng,Tom thinks Mary won't teach French.
2343604,eng,I'm in partial agreement with you.
3649301,eng,Can you speak a language other than English?
7134329,eng,"What are you chewing, big brother? a last year's gum."
6514574,eng,Tom and Mary told me they were going to win.
7132135,eng,Are there any discounts?
4737217,eng,Tom put fifty dollars on an odds-on favourite.
3959134,eng,"As the years progressed, Newton completed his work on universal gravitation, diffraction of light, centrifugal force, centripetal force, inverse-square law, bodies in motion and the variations in tides due to gravity."
3295065,eng,"After the incident, their friends and relatives began to visit them less frequently."
6518701,eng,My parents' names are Tom and Mary.
6951699,eng,I don't know where Boston is.
4977295,eng,All the criminal charges were trumped-up and the three Taliban detainees had to be released.
7156698,eng,Tom ought to have known Mary was in Australia.
3455718,eng,Don't you ever dust this place?
4495887,eng,The rash never came back.
6123713,eng,Tom has moved in with us.
6076668,eng,Tom slipped on the ice and fell.
6043048,eng,Layla might have disappeared by choice.
6395835,eng,You won't get rid of me so easily.
3560947,eng,Tom wanted to ask her to dance but was afraid that she would say no.
2512196,eng,"If you aren't careful, you'll fail again."
6341998,eng,I'm the French teacher at Tom's school.
1275449,eng,"Keep your eyes peeled, people."
6949667,eng,Tom is drinking coffee with rancid cream and eating figs. Good times.
7407309,eng,They got back into their car.
43133,eng,That is your major problem.
2237404,eng,Tom needed hope.
6502314,eng,Tom and Mary say they don't know how John will do that.
5851946,eng,Tom says that's where he put it.
6728770,eng,Tom was a wealthy man before he got married.
6425082,eng,Mary wanted me to help her today.
2345803,eng,"I like the station, but they broadcast the news too often."
6807180,eng,Sami started harassing Layla.
7230651,eng,I don't think that Tom is going to need our help.
5850866,eng,I never work on Sunday.
2546207,eng,I thought Tom was funny.
5454814,eng,We can't do such a thing.
3476650,eng,Horse riding is an expensive hobby.
3007161,eng,I guess it's decided.
2276085,eng,I don't know where exactly.
391967,eng,I'll be at home the next time she comes.
6229507,eng,I didn't see anyone else waiting in front of the station.
6520851,eng,Tom and Mary are likely to fail.
3660062,eng,The quick brown fox jumps over a lazy dog.
7475311,eng,They say they won't study French.
6648561,eng,Tom said that he thought Mary was nervous.
7356827,eng,It's so great to finally meet you.
59219,eng,This writer is at his best in his short stories.
256885,eng,I graduated from university last year.
5821414,eng,I don't know what made me think I could speak French.
2374704,eng,I kind of figured that out.
2218330,eng,You're positively glowing.
2260383,eng,You won't get it that way. Use two fingers.
1894188,eng,I can't stand it any longer.
3740358,eng,Let's toast to love!
298386,eng,He fixed the watch for me.
2912483,eng,How many margaritas have you drunk?
4267409,eng,I learned how to write my name when I was three.
4495397,eng,Never mind all that.
4009547,eng,Dan fixed a quick meal for Linda.
20680,eng,Joy was mingled with sorrow.
3734345,eng,The project isn't going well.
6522153,eng,Why are Tom and Mary nervous?
6510982,eng,Tom and Mary didn't tell John why they did that.
6422174,eng,Mary told me that she likes swimming.
5635855,eng,The negotiating parties failed to reach an agreement.
7205146,eng,Sami got fired that night.
5422763,eng,Does Tom like tea?
2255349,eng,You'll catch on.
3044759,eng,Does he know what you're here for?
5790439,eng,I don't remember your password.
7169634,eng,I think that Tom would like you to do that for Mary.
7264236,eng,Sami made out with Layla just now.
6250776,eng,We weren't in Boston with Tom.
2663284,eng,But that's not the real problem.
2958932,eng,Tom's honesty is beyond all question.
2813176,eng,My wife is too sincere. I don't know if it's good or bad.
6517130,eng,I know that Tom and Mary are furious.
5335609,eng,Einstein predicted that the Sun's gravity would bend light.
2013501,eng,"Hey, you want to take a walk?"
5096629,eng,There were no more questions.
2538815,eng,Tom wouldn't go without saying goodbye.
7227741,eng,I don't think that you really understand what I'm trying to say.
3930297,eng,Dan was thrown off a tall building.
1756820,eng,I want to relieve his anger.
7227426,eng,I don't think I'd ever want to do that by myself.
7159585,eng,I'll stay in Australia for three days.
244109,eng,"If my wife calls, just tell her I'm in an important meeting and cannot be disturbed."
3500198,eng,He has extensive experience and his competence has branched out into several fields.
1788191,eng,We didn't add pictures to our album.
1553320,eng,What is your greatest strength?
5738420,eng,Democrats oppose that idea.
7492850,eng,This sort of music isn't my cup of tea.
291816,eng,He moved the table aside.
6342605,eng,Tom thought I might be required to do that.
1886568,eng,Who told you to say that to me?
6407445,eng,Mary didn't seem surprised when Tom told her he wanted to do that.
3439635,eng,Tom seems to be jealous.
770407,eng,We will never do it again.
6422094,eng,Tell Mary that I need to talk to her.
295303,eng,He looks strong.
317442,eng,She is a poor cook.
6932149,eng,This is my favorite meal.
27583,eng,I decided that I was going to work as hard as I can.
1201732,eng,Her life is full of pain.
7737535,eng,I have a few more questions for Tom.
6664896,eng,I had good reason to be angry.
3357806,eng,You're trying my patience.
2985423,eng,This is quite a rainstorm.
3291526,eng,Lead us from falsehood to truth.
262354,eng,"I love music, too."
5344358,eng,The new community center was inaugurated yesterday with pomp and circumstance.
6427802,eng,"Mary is resilient, isn't she?"
2432160,eng,I'm studying English because I plan to go to the United States.
7558047,eng,George H. W. Bush had no respect for the dead whatsoever.
2218421,eng,You're tempting fate.
6919019,eng,"Tom is a heavy smoker, isn't he?"
2436381,eng,It's not always easy.
1618687,eng,For some reason he could not say the whole truth.
2544598,eng,Tom drank a glass of milk.
5747160,eng,This paper is pathetic.
6239288,eng,Tom didn't know that he had to do that today.
1679554,eng,This is the first time I've invited Mary.
1893669,eng,We'll be there.
6341577,eng,Tom is the one that told us about the problem.
7230571,eng,I don't think that Tom ever considered doing that.
6008667,eng,There are some things that people like to avoid discussing.
3825374,eng,Think about what you did.
6520757,eng,Tom and Mary can't do that themselves.
3148082,eng,Tom lapsed into a coma and didn't regain consciousness.
6268291,eng,Tom did that for his brother.
6428333,eng,Mary doesn't share her food.
4949942,eng,I know you hate it.
3905233,eng,Have you told him what to buy?
6272811,eng,I do that quite a lot.
6049353,eng,How could I say no?
7406785,eng,They're reading in their rooms.
3919747,eng,The cat hissed at them.
1025291,eng,Tom has three older brothers.
2537156,eng,Tom asked Mary if she would be willing to donate some money.
898051,eng,"In 1807, Robert Morrison, the first British Protestant missionary to China arrived in Guangzhou."
6657468,eng,I've been trying to figure out how to do that.
32350,eng,Mary has a flower in her hand.
7127407,eng,How did you come up with this approach?
3736711,eng,I think you ought to put more money into your savings account.
7732910,eng,Tom is really a good singer.
6495169,eng,Tom and Mary promised John they'd eat everything on their plates.
5720589,eng,I've never heard Tom cry.
1951615,eng,Tom can't find his watch.
3533851,eng,It's not always easy to translate.
6517704,eng,Tom and Mary told John they weren't busy.
7209556,eng,Sami is helping Layla now.
281201,eng,"In Japan, a beautiful city was built as early as the eighth century."
2592905,eng,Don't confuse love and desire.
63768,eng,There are some good apples in the basket.
3226488,eng,Tom wasn't aware of the danger.
2733175,eng,You've given up smoking.
7683068,eng,His father has never been abroad.
7502569,eng,"You didn't know that Tom wouldn't be able to do that, did you?"
5933879,eng,She hires other people to write her speeches.
2069004,eng,"Although the United States is a developed country, it still has some very poor people."
2240340,eng,Where's Tom's stuff?
6003894,eng,Everybody stared at Tom.
5190618,eng,I hope you come to my concert.
3904604,eng,I don't want you to come.
16344,eng,You have a good sense of humor.
7173083,eng,I thought that Tom would be amused by what was going on.
2236921,eng,Tom is wet.
529681,eng,A good case can be made for the legalization of drugs.
5854418,eng,Tom is now in a coma.
7504598,eng,I thought you weren't supposed to do that by yourselves.
6337612,eng,I haven't yet called back.
7472060,eng,Tom and Mary left their house before dawn.
6094752,eng,Layla realized there was no way out.
6223398,eng,Tom likes fruit more than vegetables.
3916697,eng,What did you get from her?
6497887,eng,You should've told Tom and Mary why they needed to do that.
53296,eng,Jim has gone to London.
7139763,eng,Tom is going to retire next year.
6530482,eng,Tom is running a little behind.
2406303,eng,I sent you the money you asked for.
3474353,eng,That isn't what I said.
2360859,eng,I hope I'm not boring you.
7126484,eng,Tom received the award in 2013.
7265561,eng,Sami is watching my YouTube channel.
4015799,eng,I told Tom I just want to be friends.
2397021,eng,How is this supposed to be funny?
6474446,eng,The judge declared Sami and Layla divorced.
2264202,eng,Go ahead and write your letter. I'll wait.
5240981,eng,I feel really bad about that.
6354347,eng,Tom isn't the only boy invited to Mary's party.
6260405,eng,Tom thinks Mary doesn't have a driver's license.
6120679,eng,"Tom wanted to hire us both, but he said he could only hire one of us."
7380010,eng,Mary told me she's pessimistic.
7230992,eng,I don't think that I'll be doing that anymore.
3907431,eng,I'll be good to you.
2863737,eng,"In order to tag sentences, you must, at least, be an ""advanced"" contributor."
7229500,eng,"Sami is in this story, too."
3454215,eng,Who invited you to the party?
887266,eng,She knit him a sweater for his birthday.
1347045,eng,I work as Mr. Eliot's assistant.
7229685,eng,I don't think that this is the one I that lost.
6245159,eng,I hope that Tom won't do that again.
55740,eng,This is the dog that Ken owns.
257537,eng,I ran all the way to the station this morning.
3408942,eng,Where did you read that?
5903675,eng,Mr. Jackson was my French teacher when I was in high school.
7110753,eng,I think that Tom is sloshed.
1029318,eng,Tom didn't help Mary.
7395681,eng,He says he can't remember things.
1842,eng,"If you know that something unpleasant will happen, that you will go to the dentist for example, or to France, then that is not good."
6049398,eng,Lift your right arm.
1839505,eng,I saw Tom on television.
3729601,eng,The organ started to play.
6664655,eng,We can manage this on our own.
253567,eng,I compared this picture with that picture.
5238202,eng,I'll never be able to do that.
7398001,eng,"She already knew that, didn't she?"
317890,eng,The accused was condemned to ten years in prison.
7194906,eng,All of my children go to school in Australia.
25087,eng,I need something to write with.
490763,eng,What's all the fuss about? Damned if I know!
3912422,eng,I wish I hadn't married him.
275769,eng,A number of people were drowned.
327352,eng,The world seen through the lace curtain was dark.
4497913,eng,Can anyone else do that?
5358165,eng,What do people do for fun in Boston?
5937007,eng,I thoroughly enjoyed myself in Boston.
55133,eng,These cups are all broken.
5858729,eng,I was quite wrong.
6008632,eng,"Why is it that all their examples have been translated in dozens of languages, while ours have been translated in only a few?"
7540962,eng,Tom is only pretending that he's having fun.
3912309,eng,Let's meet him at the station.
2644117,eng,I doubt that Tom is hungry.
6654347,eng,Tom said that he didn't want to go skiing with Mary.
236936,eng,Please tell me how to spell your name.
38829,eng,"Turn off the light, please."
6233088,eng,I still haven't told Tom why I needed to do that.
314479,eng,She sews with a needle and thread.
6266099,eng,Tom thinks he's a good driver.
5751960,eng,I was just devastated.
6225643,eng,That isn't the main reason why Tom wants to do that.
7258126,eng,Tom is better at this than I am.
2202701,eng,Tom is courageous.
6236197,eng,Tom said he was the only one who had to do that.
1963055,eng,Where is the ship now?
7172679,eng,I thought that Tom might stop by this afternoon.
246117,eng,The northernmost part of the city is a maze of alleys.
2897124,eng,Do seedless watermelons exist?
6648522,eng,Tom said that he thought Mary was the best singer in his class.
3820578,eng,Did you ask Tom to stop?
501171,eng,I can sing well.
6539559,eng,I've got a question for Sami.
6702707,eng,Sami had breakfast at a McDonald's.
2549151,eng,I turned Tom down.
6809315,eng,The second Gulf War caused a surge in the price of petroleum.
3825365,eng,Do you think Tom will die?
7381132,eng,Mary is now truly on her own.
5369959,eng,Those books that are in the box have all been read.
7541894,eng,Tom used to work as a private detective.
6710679,eng,Why not get some sleep?
2641873,eng,Tom is on the phone with Mary now.
6882545,eng,I shouldn't have.
4016455,eng,Tom explained the rules in detail.
6842658,eng,I think there's somebody in here.
6867848,eng,What Tom thinks isn't important.
2646271,eng,Tom was sad and upset.
5853181,eng,How's Tom tonight?
2031537,eng,I don't want to hear anything more about that.
460021,eng,My favorite color is red.
2646614,eng,Has Tom been released?
2980292,eng,Women are often objectified and treated like property.
6515390,eng,Tom and Mary are good at everything they do.
6423228,eng,Mary said she wanted to go shopping.
1027116,eng,Tom appeared to be in his early thirties.
6226577,eng,Almost everyone I know has been to Boston at least once.
6262371,eng,I'm trying to be cooperative.
6100203,eng,Layla isn't with Sami.
7374264,eng,"Mary is a beginner, but she catches on fast."
54526,eng,"If you change your address, please let me know."
3181901,eng,Tom knows what we're talking about.
5422329,eng,It's not normal.
4217005,eng,This is very easy!
5906091,eng,Tom joined the high school band.
1830621,eng,How many cookies did you eat?
3729801,eng,Tom is still pretty groggy.
5754007,eng,Tom retired from his job as a wholesaler of flowers.
58541,eng,Don't go out in this heat with a bare head.
6013593,eng,Is it really that good?
7521964,eng,I know Tom is greedy.
325806,eng,It's starting to cool off.
6807557,eng,Sami messaged Layla when he got home.
6525903,eng,I wasn't able to talk Tom into baking a cake for Mary's birthday party.
7259855,eng,Sami and Layla have started to drift apart.
2275280,eng,Don't make me shoot you.
3504508,eng,This word has three syllables.
4147463,eng,God's will is unquestionable.
4846657,eng,Mary hid behind her large sunglasses.
6506313,eng,Tom and Mary said they wouldn't mind waiting for us.
5856408,eng,I'll be asleep by the time you get here.
954071,eng,It's amazing that so many people cross this street when the light is red.
72694,eng,Let's have tea at 3:00.
3506952,eng,My mother and father aren't home right now.
5820768,eng,Tom still misses you.
2643693,eng,Tom almost bumped into Mary.
1271905,eng,Look around.
5481097,eng,Tom ordered escargots.
1867969,eng,Tom read the letter aloud.
34960,eng,I need some hangers.
7444220,eng,They told me that they didn't feel well.
7143666,eng,I didn't think that Tom would want to sing.
4427371,eng,Take one of me.
2723776,eng,I forgot them.
7286473,eng,Sami had every intention of going to the police department and report Layla.
7176832,eng,Tom said that we couldn't do anything about it.
6829712,eng,Tom and Mary have become missionaries.
7143706,eng,I didn't think that we could take that risk.
332327,eng,When you're a parent it's important to set a good example for your children.
6907460,eng,This aisle is reserved solely for toothbrushes.
3728799,eng,Tom's eyes were moist.
3567234,eng,Tom's enjoyment of his first visit to Europe was enhanced by his ready grasp of languages.
391902,eng,I like her younger sister very much.
7197417,eng,It's not something that I can decide quickly.
6512236,eng,Do you think Tom and Mary are still alive?
3204947,eng,Tom told his children that Santa Claus wasn't real.
6248538,eng,I don't feel like doing that tonight.
5592444,eng,I'll buy a book for Tom.
6435590,eng,Tom said he thought Mary was innocent.
3123766,eng,You catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.
1649015,eng,We will meet again.
3095092,eng,Aren't you pleased?
238725,eng,Her father did nothing but weep at her wedding.
6250840,eng,Tom said that the smell bothered him.
6663484,eng,Tom and I aren't the only ones who know what to do.
6251922,eng,I didn't really care what happened.
6344746,eng,Maybe you aren't doing that correctly.
5915851,eng,I usually don't wear pajamas.
7142889,eng,I think you shouldn't have eaten so much junk food.
5858128,eng,I jog every day.
7249842,eng,Sami thought I did it.
6660518,eng,Who are Tom and I supposed to go with?
3341612,eng,Are you going to open the box?
5454764,eng,I'm only interested in nonstop flights.
4586778,eng,This novel has been published in French as well.
388982,eng,He can read well enough.
6433575,eng,Tom said that Mary wouldn't want to do that.
2735594,eng,Tom has everything a boy could possibly want.
3410943,eng,"Get in the car, please."
3417377,eng,Tom is anxious to go abroad.
7388594,eng,She hopped in her car and drove off.
1069577,eng,The only thing that matters is that you are safe.
4014059,eng,Do we need to decide this right now?
3812926,eng,The state oppresses the people.
4967212,eng,You're contradicting yourselves.
6577466,eng,Can you show me your record collection?
6023017,eng,They're thieves and murderers.
802679,eng,They said his army was not strong enough to attack.
7512352,eng,I know that Tom is afraid to try new things.
2743553,eng,Tom isn't strong enough to lift that.
5009337,eng,Tom has a valid point.
4015654,eng,Would you order me a hamburger?
4329087,eng,"Since it was a fine day, I went for a walk."
4928216,eng,Has he ever snored?
7159309,eng,Tom likes talking about Australia.
5504584,eng,Tom took care of Mary's children while she was in the hospital.
3615673,eng,"Well, it happens."
7266541,eng,Sami showed Layla how to sign some basic ASL phrases.
7203171,eng,Sami can't stand to see Layla like this.
6418264,eng,Mary will get killed if she's not careful.
6530180,eng,Tom shouldn't have quit his job.
1062330,eng,Can't you move faster?
23449,eng,"Compared to our house, his is a palace."
5832808,eng,Your wedding is going to be fabulous and unforgettable.
5437166,eng,There is no middle ground between these two options.
296466,eng,He is now playing tennis on the court.
6571882,eng,Sami faced peer pressure at school.
3704871,eng,May I add you on Facebook?
7127687,eng,How do you know when it's time to pull the trigger?
7382816,eng,She seemed a little hard on herself.
7117036,eng,Tom could be intoxicated.
2372858,eng,I just needed this one.
5850742,eng,We need to create more jobs.
36598,eng,"That can diagnose anything, quicker and cheaper than a doctor."
241666,eng,I've just come up with a great idea.
3911974,eng,You'll miss her.
5886900,eng,Fadil left without a word to anyone.
7117500,eng,Tom considers Mary a friend.
6509728,eng,I think Tom and Mary need medical attention.
1870108,eng,Why are my students lazy?
286575,eng,His car is gaining on us.
2869883,eng,You speak English.
4443280,eng,You can't really figure out whether someone's a decent person or not based on their clothing.
7444051,eng,Tom and Mary told me that they won.
248654,eng,We walked about five miles.
71234,eng,I identify with you.
48652,eng,The piece was arranged for piano and orchestra.
5852345,eng,I don't agree with that at all.
5541518,eng,That is not what he is going to talk about.
7130958,eng,Tom just shook his head and laughed.
2954628,eng,You need to do something about Tom's behavior.
6555137,eng,The tree in front of the library was struck by lightning.
6049134,eng,Tom is reluctant to do that.
7389531,eng,She smiled as she took her seat.
58601,eng,This kind of plant grows only in the tropical regions.
7114183,eng,I'm afraid to kiss Tom.
5499271,eng,That puppy is so adorable.
7502970,eng,"I know that I shouldn't have asked Tom to do that, but I did."
5565536,eng,What was the announcement just now?
6416417,eng,"Mary is being very obedient today, isn't she?"
3129870,eng,That could never happen to me.
6482488,eng,I talked to Tom after class.
6868256,eng,You should have gone to Boston.
7400350,eng,She denies she broke the window.
7237042,eng,Did you know mosquitoes have teeth?
7171815,eng,I thought you said that you'd do that tomorrow.
265922,eng,It is necessary to fight AIDS with whatever weapons are at hand.
4869442,eng,"Free transportation will be provided, but you are expected to pay for your own food and drinks."
667135,eng,I won't see her anymore.
575334,eng,Is your new computer working well?
3328540,eng,Can I have another bagel?
254934,eng,I said so only by guess.
6504661,eng,Tom and Mary are waiting for that to happen again.
6267420,eng,My favorite food is pizza.
5752498,eng,Let's wrap things up.
1099660,eng,His house is near the river.
241885,eng,It is all right so far.
5860545,eng,You're a good leader.
4133545,eng,The exact same thing happened to one of my friends.
7176260,eng,Tom thinks that you can take care of yourself.
2240198,eng,Tom went away.
5730856,eng,I'll tell you what I won't buy.
6462100,eng,Sami admitted that he was having an affair with Layla.
7232580,eng,I don't think that Tom really has to do that again.
2107562,eng,Tom's lonely.
6866308,eng,Every room in my house has two or more windows.
2276475,eng,I won't say another word.
2727484,eng,We can operate a crane.
6212475,eng,"How beautifully the flowers shoot forth, but I am not weaving garlands!"
1195330,eng,Carlos Morel was the first Argentine illustrator.
250399,eng,"I, for my part, don't care."
2359505,eng,I haven't felt that way since Mary left.
3372135,eng,I think Tom hangs out with Mary too much.
1027844,eng,Tom used to enjoy being with Mary.
6689351,eng,"Unfortunately, it happens sometimes."
1826358,eng,She didn't come before two.
7172470,eng,I thought that Tom could lend Mary some money.
5640046,eng,I hope Tom doesn't notice.
7438656,eng,They said they hoped they could do that.
2643716,eng,"Pull yourself together, Tom."
6711023,eng,Sami seemed to have no known enemies.
6393062,eng,What was that again?
293394,eng,He emptied a glass of wine.
3738544,eng,What are Tom's main achievements?
3597494,eng,Tom's time is very valuable.
7152969,eng,Tom wants to be in Australia.
7470773,eng,Tom and Mary complained about their low salaries.
597773,eng,They gave me an offer that I couldn't refuse.
4501562,eng,Is Tom protecting someone?
2646905,eng,Tom may be in danger.
6713403,eng,Is this the first time you've been back to Boston since your divorce?
4013646,eng,What do you think's causing this problem?
7542316,eng,Tom asked Mary to walk a little slower.
5780390,eng,What do you say we ditch this joint?
3904575,eng,I don't want her to give up.
7502686,eng,I know that Tom knows that Mary won't need to do that anymore.
2203292,eng,We're rich.
6337225,eng,I wonder if I'm really supposed to be doing this.
2661852,eng,He popped a balloon besides my ear and I was really scared.
5879532,eng,Fadil spent every spare moment searching the web for a gift to buy Layla.
3135703,eng,I don't expect that to happen anytime soon.
1966436,eng,Would you like to take a stroll around the park with me?
1026466,eng,Tom did what he had been told to do.
7070403,eng,Sami bought Layla another dog.
6230622,eng,Tom didn't seem surprised when I told him he had to do that.
2643297,eng,Tom asked if I needed a taxi.
5241071,eng,I traveled all around Russia.
7388218,eng,He's been busy cleaning his room.
2995454,eng,Please don't tell anyone about this.
39793,eng,The tuberculin reaction was positive.
6826901,eng,I'm going to need more money than this.
7137278,eng,Sometimes Tom swims laps before breakfast.
7009923,eng,For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.
37194,eng,Tom is a good worker.
269451,eng,How can you make a living from selling newspapers?
25408,eng,Few things give us as much pleasure as music.
6728648,eng,"Last year, I wasn't able to do that as often as I wanted to."
7250664,eng,Sami is an anxious traveler.
7226330,eng,I don't think that anyone really understands me.
7384991,eng,She forgot her glasses.
456581,eng,Our visitors are sitting in the living room.
3823140,eng,There will be other chances to do this later.
7137764,eng,I can't afford to do this.
7391690,eng,She was having the time of her life.
239357,eng,There was nothing but the ocean as far as the eye could see.
5506980,eng,We want to move to Boston.
6110303,eng,I'm not used to doing this.
7387147,eng,He canceled his hotel reservation.
3912207,eng,I want you to meet him.
5228937,eng,"Get out of here, you dog!"
3024215,eng,I wish I were in Boston.
3958642,eng,Nicolaus Copernicus was born in Poland in 1473.
6506677,eng,Tom and Mary had to walk school when they were kids.
7131526,eng,Are you still staying at this hotel?
5839430,eng,I consider Fadil a pimp.
1589674,eng,There is no point in deluding yourself; you know it well that she's just playing games with you.
7733605,eng,Tom is still in pain.
2962515,eng,Creativity is everywhere.
674482,eng,What are you up to tomorrow afternoon?
6238351,eng,I didn't know Tom was the one who did that.
7361053,eng,Layla was wearing a hijab.
6107828,eng,Layla found a way to safety.
6432940,eng,Tom is going to get in trouble if he does that.
7183546,eng,Sami can't see Layla's face.
6491171,eng,Tom and Mary are planning on going.
6266314,eng,Tom said that Mary won't do that anymore.
2903637,eng,I have the right to express my opinion.
742066,eng,Mary's the laziest of her schoolmates.
6424441,eng,Mary told me that she was pleased.
7403030,eng,She said she felt invincible.
1632500,eng,Mary went to the beauty salon to get a manicure.
3708695,eng,I'd like to ask for something to drink.
2326517,eng,I filled in the blanks.
5909833,eng,I wish I had a girlfriend like Mary.
6335264,eng,Tom never should've left early.
418875,eng,"At one time, there was a bridge here."
5647060,eng,I learned that a long time ago.
2245555,eng,Help me up.
64676,eng,A customer came and so tea was brewed.
6529300,eng,I need to tell my wife I'll be late.
2744199,eng,I got an IV at the hospital.
5853005,eng,I was naughty.
627265,eng,Learning a foreign language is interesting.
4976470,eng,My ex-wife started a new life with the tubby postman.
7240195,eng,I wanted to let you know I'd be late.
302772,eng,He stood close to her and tried to protect her from the typhoon.
3821118,eng,You took some unnecessary risks.
4193797,eng,Tomorrow is my first day of work.
1742315,eng,"Good night, dear friend!"
501424,eng,There's no class today.
3496604,eng,These aren't real.
4014551,eng,Was that all you wanted to ask me?
2958848,eng,Would you rather come with us?
6421635,eng,Mary said she wanted to be left alone.
4664903,eng,"Yes, of course, you're correct."
5699134,eng,I'm genuinely concerned with Tom's health.
6269747,eng,I decided not to do that.
1103054,eng,"Hey mister, you forgot your coat!"
6439311,eng,Why should I join the team?
6502501,eng,Tom and Mary said they probably wouldn't do that again.
7194783,eng,How far is Australia from New Zealand?
7173583,eng,I thought that you didn't have a boyfriend.
6226870,eng,Everyone except Tom knew that he didn't need to stay in Boston.
6530067,eng,Tom can stay with us if he likes.
44871,eng,The store carries earthenware.
6423782,eng,Mary told me she wasn't happy here.
57065,eng,This book is much more useful than that one.
6702234,eng,Why did you think you had to do that?
4667225,eng,Don't rely on Tom.
773403,eng,I've heard barley is yielding fruit in Sisku's field.
265207,eng,We found out their plot before they took their actions.
51769,eng,It is necessary that every member observe these rules.
25317,eng,We cannot conceive science without a hypothesis.
7174609,eng,I thought that Tom was your younger brother.
7394562,eng,She said she was too young to drink.
7262261,eng,What are you cooking? It smells good.
6247766,eng,Perhaps you could borrow an umbrella.
3203908,eng,Some of Tom's chooks got through a hole in the fence and dug up his neighbour's lettuce plants.
3824957,eng,This is very embarrassing.
7270120,eng,Have you ever been stuck in a lift?
7517229,eng,I know Tom would never do that again.
3910925,eng,The police are questioning him.
571632,eng,He passed away yesterday.
7240174,eng,I didn't know that somebody was watching me.
6254809,eng,Tom said Mary was the only one who got here on time today.
2659575,eng,My father and my older brother work in this factory.
278744,eng,Iron is harder than gold.
6221680,eng,Tom said he'd help me do that as well.
6882628,eng,Thomas is in love with you.
4121013,eng,I don't know what you want to say.
572970,eng,Tom doesn't have to go to school today.
2858232,eng,What is he famous for?
2687217,eng,Every man or woman for themselves!
5298872,eng,I've already been to America two times.
6579288,eng,Mary cannot open the door.
2630823,eng,This camera belongs to me.
3825993,eng,There was nothing to burn.
6265619,eng,Tom can do that extremely well.
6960935,eng,"I understand what you mean, but I'm not sure how to translate it."
7143668,eng,I didn't think that Tom wrote anything.
6789093,eng,"Ah, mother mine! he chides her, as she flies, / ""art thou, then, also cruel? Wherefore cheat / thy son so oft with images and lies? / Why may I not clasp hands, and talk without disguise?"""
6528696,eng,Tom is still wearing his wedding ring.
5753343,eng,I still want to play.
480884,eng,I'll phone you.
3310203,eng,We've got to escape.
7408606,eng,They forced themselves to do that.
7218057,eng,Sami doesn't understand why his paycheck is so short.
7035330,eng,The teacher lowered me down to sit on the ground.
6257893,eng,Tom seems to want to study French.
2406882,eng,I suppose it's time to go.
5774444,eng,Come over here. I'll rub your back.
6276571,eng,"Hello, I'm Huan."
7130723,eng,Tom will remain behind bars for good.
4016621,eng,It's quite likely that Tom won't come.
6421169,eng,Mary doesn't allow her kids to do that.
1450641,eng,My father finally compromised.
6232856,eng,Tom is one of the thirty people who needed to do that.
6873418,eng,I can't afford to buy such a thing.
3986816,eng,Perhaps it was a convincing idea overall.
6124353,eng,You're supposed to be helping Tom now.
6516945,eng,Tom and Mary said they plan on doing that.
6797953,eng,Trump polarizes politics in the United States.
6164885,eng,I'm not leaving until tomorrow.
2546101,eng,I'll be in the basement.
3647270,eng,The boy is asking a question.
7110559,eng,I want you to know that I didn't do that.
6434371,eng,Mary showed me a picture of her boyfriend.
6829708,eng,I asked Tom to take some pictures.
31128,eng,The music of Mozart is always pleasing to me.
1796636,eng,Nobody mentions my country.
3439750,eng,Tom is extremely kind.
59547,eng,Her help is vital to the success of this plan.
6506537,eng,Tom and Mary said that they were really discouraged.
7472394,eng,Tom and Mary felt like they could do it.
7045214,eng,Florence was damaged during World War II.
7004753,eng,Stop making fun of me.
6348077,eng,Tom probably doesn't believe that.
4759181,eng,I cried reading this book.
6349372,eng,It looks like you're distracted.
5166545,eng,I'm a little upset.
5001052,eng,It's terribly hot this morning.
2951362,eng,I remember last night well.
3726519,eng,Tom and Mary clung to each other.
54307,eng,Can I tell my father what you want?
5050119,eng,His eyes lit up.
247769,eng,We found to our joy that all the crew were alive.
2361626,eng,I know you didn't hurt Tom.
7443002,eng,They know that they ought to do that.
6422029,eng,I told Mary she wouldn't like it here.
917744,eng,"If he really liked me, he would call me more often."
2953203,eng,Mary noticed that Tom had not shaved in several days.
7177666,eng,Tom said that Mary was going to ask John to do that.
7184199,eng,I don't think that it's a good idea for you to go Australia by yourself.
2489920,eng,Jaume's grandmother spoke Catalan better than Spanish.
3914459,eng,I'm not trying to impress her.
6676704,eng,I suspected Tom didn't really want to go to Boston.
3910155,eng,I thought you came to see him.
2240617,eng,We're not eating.
6593225,eng,Sami has just had a narrow escape from a delisional stalker.
3031663,eng,She wandered about the country.
2467698,eng,Do you have the source code?
4501817,eng,We want positive results.
6230882,eng,I don't think Tom will be able to do that very well.
6500660,eng,I would've never guessed that Tom and Mary were from Boston.
1025065,eng,Tom is close to thirty.
5322755,eng,The sun is much bigger than Jupiter.
2728681,eng,I just missed the train.
256156,eng,I am a member of the sales department.
810337,eng,You're weird - I like you.
7402733,eng,He should stay where he is.
5738434,eng,Tom lost all his belongings.
7428274,eng,See you tonight!
321460,eng,I can't find my pen.
6350626,eng,I knew Tom wouldn't win.
1887826,eng,I thought you were used to living in a trailer.
7231027,eng,I don't think that Tom misses Mary very much.
1354885,eng,He came from one of the richest families in the United States.
5746117,eng,I put the pressure on Tom.
34185,eng,Do you have any French wine?
6244019,eng,I thought Tom was going to be killed.
244618,eng,I ate too much food yesterday.
3918450,eng,You'd better find her.
2011933,eng,I want you to come back.
48347,eng,I'll talk the matter over with my father.
7218239,eng,Tom told me he thought that Mary would be worried.
43656,eng,That question is under discussion.
7381954,eng,Mary said she was amused.
24052,eng,Our rent is four times as much as it was ten years ago.
737867,eng,A lot of people ask why the cat does not appear among the twelve animals of the Chinese zodiac.
7519420,eng,I know Tom never used to do that.
7127401,eng,How can you not be excited about today?
7227721,eng,I don't think that you should do that today.
7203122,eng,Sami's story doesn't make sense.
6342688,eng,I suggest you do that as soon as possible.
3973230,eng,"What will you do with the body, my lord?"
7126018,eng,Mary is convinced Tom is the man for her.
262169,eng,I intend to study abroad next year.
2240592,eng,We're in college.
6815740,eng,"Meanwhile from neighbouring Tenedos once more, / beneath the tranquil moonbeam's friendly care, / with ordered ships, along the deep sea-floor, / back came the Argive host, and sought the well-known shore. / Forth from the royal galley sprang the flame, / when Sinon, screened by partial Fate, withdrew / the bolts and barriers of the pinewood frame, / and from its inmost caverns, bared to view, / the fatal horse disgorged the Danaan crew."
6233355,eng,Don't you think it would be impossible to do that?
3377991,eng,Yesterday I sold two books.
5320375,eng,Alchemists tried to transmute base metals into gold and silver.
6628078,eng,Never volunteer for anything.
4011507,eng,How long will it really take you?
7437312,eng,Tom and Mary said that they didn't know why.
3442173,eng,Tom will call you later.
5257468,eng,I could see nothing good in this city.
6660565,eng,I don't think Tom will be coming in this morning.
6422437,eng,Mary said she thought Tom was hungry.
7205847,eng,Sami had to put gas in his car.
3821987,eng,Your objection is noted.
7190381,eng,I assume that all our equipment is still up to date.
6514260,eng,"Tom and Mary are very dedicated, aren't they?"
6428456,eng,Mary told me she was ready.
6420243,eng,Mary pretended that she didn't hear Tom.
3903979,eng,I was having dinner with him.
6256411,eng,Tom intends to come back to Boston.
5151213,eng,Tom remains in custody.
6261684,eng,Tom has been blamed for the mess.
3903134,eng,I'll take it up with him.
2609435,eng,"My whole life long, I fought against superstition."
3917719,eng,I need to buy a gift for them.
47051,eng,Fix the fact in your mind.
3024172,eng,I'm going to Boston tomorrow.
7562900,eng,Did you have pleasant dreams?
791812,eng,He is the tallest person in the class.
6869077,eng,Tom should have told me about that sooner.
6938736,eng,Tom and I've known each other quite a few years.
2540579,eng,I'll drive you back to your hotel.
3443070,eng,Don't buy it!
6567921,eng,Sami shot an unarmed black teenager.
7450619,eng,Why did she dump me?
5852010,eng,I'm going to enjoy being here.
309916,eng,She lost her only son in the traffic accident.
6698998,eng,May I borrow your bicycle tomorrow afternoon?
2543447,eng,I'm well aware of the facts.
6089865,eng,I think we've been cooperative.
7511737,eng,I know Tom is a better bass player than Mary.
73703,eng,"Cheer up, she said to me."
269865,eng,Wires are used to convey electricity.
1877446,eng,Tom and Mary both don't know how to drive.
684728,eng,"Today, the Ministry of Health announced that it has stopped distribution of and is recalling a medicine for children due to the problem of heart related side effects. The government has taken this into account and has forbidden the importation of this medicine."
7045219,eng,"A flood ravaged Florence in 1966, causing damage to many priceless works of art."
35727,eng,Is there a Percy in your class?
6228059,eng,How many more weeks do you think Tom will want to do that?
6513362,eng,Do Tom and Mary know how to ride a horse?
2635927,eng,"What do you know about me, exactly?"
1128696,eng,"I am Finnish, but I speak also Swedish."
6247157,eng,Doing that would really make me happy.
5194605,eng,I wanted to spend more time in Boston.
4114332,eng,Can I have a private opinion?
2290402,eng,I didn't know you worked here.
7227680,eng,I don't think that you understand how important this is to me.
273811,eng,Please give me the money in twenty-dollar bills.
2658393,eng,I learned many things about Greek culture.
6967185,eng,Tom is less active than his brother.
67486,eng,How would you know an American from an Englishman?
7475319,eng,They say they have nothing to do.
43346,eng,The old man drew a large crowd around him by his music.
317632,eng,His vain efforts to seduce her showed he was barking up the wrong tree; she was a mother of two tots.
1095822,eng,Tom attempted to predict the results.
2642936,eng,Tom figured it out on his own.
6007110,eng,This place is hideous.
1093064,eng,"Tom said he couldn't make it tonight, but he could make it some other time."
2083793,eng,I don't generally go out of the house to want to see other people.
3907115,eng,Please don't listen to her.
1886033,eng,Do you want to know who did this?
5732830,eng,Let's slow down just a minute.
6310046,eng,"I will tell you all, sir. Do not imagine that my agitation on behalf of my son arises from any fear lest he should have had a hand in this terrible affair. He is utterly innocent of it. My dread is, however, that in your eyes and in the eyes of others he may appear to be compromised."
401948,eng,What are you doing at school this afternoon?
6409893,eng,When do you think Mary is going to want us to help her?
1025843,eng,Tom eats the same food every day.
7160582,eng,Sami was packing his bag.
4726358,eng,The Netherlands and the Isles of Scilly technically warred for 335 years.
2643041,eng,I really thought Tom was busy.
6410616,eng,Mary drove past Tom's house on her way home from work.
2376370,eng,I know what Tom would do.
313834,eng,"She said she was sick yesterday, which was not true."
7735436,eng,We've done that together several times.
3280391,eng,Did Tom ever mention Mary?
6412662,eng,Mary says she doesn't know why Tom has to do that.
6891074,eng,Tom was speaking faster than usual.
4501661,eng,Tom set this record.
6523037,eng,Tom and Mary let themselves in.
3908660,eng,Don't tell him you're lost.
5744530,eng,The butler serves dinner.
240507,eng,The public school system is coming apart at the seams.
6105695,eng,"I can understand the language, but I can't speak it."
6417642,eng,Mary says she doesn't want to work outside.
3820520,eng,Something has to be done with this stuff.
6108777,eng,Do you like carrots?
6687951,eng,I'm likely to need to do that.
6376166,eng,"When Sami and Layla went home, they argued."
5514041,eng,You should always keep the room clean.
2796904,eng,Tom parachuted to safety.
2929578,eng,Lies beget lies.
7429221,eng,Tom had never really been close to anyone.
3923318,eng,How big is your room?
6252381,eng,You should do that somewhere else.
6336782,eng,I wonder if Tom is really tired.
7473782,eng,They say that they'll stay for dinner.
4915797,eng,We got better this week.
5840653,eng,We might not have enough time to eat lunch.
3500034,eng,Let's hope for the best but expect the worst.
5852027,eng,The brake's not working.
1562057,eng,"Stop threatening inanimate objects, they can't hear you."
3449278,eng,Tom knew there had to be a better way.
4310540,eng,Tom Jackson's book has been translated into many languages.
4667031,eng,Tom became concerned.
5737690,eng,There's no way to defeat Tom.
3232263,eng,"As of the last meeting, the problem hasn't been dealt with."
7395172,eng,He could get hurt if he does that.
7173211,eng,I thought that Tom would enjoy doing that.
7117725,eng,I can explain this in detail if you want me to.
7130072,eng,Tom doesn't seem to have everything sorted out.
285212,eng,His anger is understandable.
3330039,eng,"I'll get it for you, Tom."
2645607,eng,Why don't you go there?
6246356,eng,I didn't think Tom would be lonely.
7299303,eng,Sami told Layla to redo the quiz.
2271842,eng,I don't feel good.
4360007,eng,"Scuba divers have found many interesting things under water including gold coins, ancient ruins, and fossils of extinct animals."
3355238,eng,I have my hands full.
1874039,eng,Do you really want to live in Boston?
4501815,eng,Was the result surprising?
3044220,eng,Tom promised he'd take care of that.
3908717,eng,Maybe we should tell her.
7043651,eng,"In Denmark, where the Meteorological Institute reported that the month of July has been the sunniest since they started recording data in 1920, sales of alcoholic beverages dropped in favor of non-alcoholic beers and sodas."
3286972,eng,There's nothing more to drink.
67950,eng,He came on board this company with a lot of fanfare and he turns out to have the skill and talent to live up to it.
6127709,eng,Layla remembers Sami.
3991362,eng,Dan split the rent with Linda.
3605496,eng,Don't be so tense.
6668767,eng,Sami was at the scene of the murder.
6517285,eng,I can see why Tom and Mary are upset.
4013469,eng,Tom probably didn't really mean what he said.
304393,eng,He took no notice of his friend's advice.
6810277,eng,Sami still works in that restaurant.
53417,eng,They began to walk after a while.
254603,eng,I have been busier than the two boys.
5859413,eng,I'm not that crazy.
6814030,eng,There you've hit a false address.
2742732,eng,It makes me sad that you're going to leave this city.
4062892,eng,Do you play basketball?
4104527,eng,Tom removed his tie and unbuttoned his collar.
4032952,eng,Arrogance has always been my pet aversion.
286570,eng,His play ended in large success.
1523586,eng,The period is missing at the end of the sentence.
7405644,eng,He said he's excited.
6025199,eng,"Tom studied hard for the test, but he failed it anyway."
1572798,eng,Do you know where she bought herself a cat?
5257511,eng,I'd like to be on the team.
2892775,eng,Where can Tom be?
15910,eng,Your reading is very advanced.
2028157,eng,Better do the right job than do the job right.
6124847,eng,Tom was kicked out of the party.
263154,eng,We have been on bad terms with each other for a long time.
2600109,eng,Tom reads nothing but fiction.
6410858,eng,Mary told Tom that she thought John was disappointed.
3595646,eng,"Darling, why don't you watch a little television while I slip into something more comfortable."
4191608,eng,Do storks really stand on one leg?
6273879,eng,Tom asked Mary what she'd do.
5497521,eng,Are you sure that's what it was?
56242,eng,This will be the book you're looking for.
6253160,eng,Tom said Mary thought he might be allowed to do that by himself.
7236000,eng,I don't think that anyone does that anymore.
2280379,eng,Mary is a manicurist.
3568434,eng,Is this guy bothering you?
6331141,eng,The grizzly bear headed to the river to fish.
3430736,eng,"You can read where you were, but you can't write where you'll be."
3619339,eng,I'd like you to pay attention.
276520,eng,No one will speak for you.
1094794,eng,Tom didn't feel like studying at all.
6920791,eng,How many days a week do you see Tom?
7542133,eng,Tom was kind of cute when he was a kid.
6818577,eng,I didn't know you could cook.
6873514,eng,I've learned a little French.
7471462,eng,Tom and Mary lost what little money they had.
6339225,eng,I wasn't the one who convinced Tom to do that.
6660346,eng,Go and see what Tom is doing.
6022810,eng,I can't imagine how anyone could seriously believe that.
2276206,eng,I don't speak to Tom.
246345,eng,Death is the antithesis of life.
5119598,eng,I'm traveling to Spain.
3331040,eng,You're grown men. Act like it.
1120660,eng,It's often said that Japanese is a difficult language to learn.
3174781,eng,I'll call you back in an hour.
1740526,eng,I am not going out because I have to revise.
7398306,eng,She told me she forgot something.
6448466,eng,Sami won't leave this place until he recovers.
5532819,eng,We spent hours looking for it.
7740227,eng,Tom was pointing at Mary.
3205094,eng,You should probably tell Tom you don't want to do that.
2539306,eng,"You're a certified pilot, aren't you?"
3854012,eng,"Tom, you do know this is a public forum, don't you? Throwing a hissy fit because people happened to misinterpret your Facebook post makes you seem controlling and humourless, and more or less guarantees still more mocking responses."
6266261,eng,Tom said that he wasn't tired.
2711653,eng,This wood has a beautiful grain.
2461068,eng,I thought Tom was in love with Mary.
5748283,eng,Let's not ease up now.
6506676,eng,"As far as I can tell, Tom and Mary aren't lying."
1092299,eng,Tom went down the river in a canoe.
7183957,eng,Tom admitted he'd been unfair.
2268752,eng,These socks don't stretch when you wash them.
5095973,eng,A cult member attempted to assassinate the queen with poisoned fruit.
1341377,eng,"I'm busy. If that weren't the case, I'd accept your invitation."
7503120,eng,Tom called Mary to tell her that he wanted her to help John.
2406073,eng,I saw it on the news.
3417196,eng,"Tom is very energetic, isn't he?"
5853298,eng,I'm Tom's twin.
317581,eng,I invited her to go to the movies.
1116717,eng,You'll definitely fail if you don't study more.
6474413,eng,Sami and Layla hung out together.
6106868,eng,Layla was an artistic and brilliant girl.
6880080,eng,She liked my jokes.
1554140,eng,"If the people knew by what small men they are ruled, they would soon rebel."
2360963,eng,I hope you find Tom.
2875227,eng,She decorated the classroom.
875639,eng,I want to do a little physical exercise.
5859566,eng,I'm sometimes a bit absent-minded.
5064858,eng,I won't wait forever.
2304842,eng,I felt guilty.
5961610,eng,You woke up early this morning.
3820594,eng,Don't be so stingy.
2761754,eng,Lock the dog in the kitchen.
5441775,eng,I think I've changed my mind.
241067,eng,Don't go if you don't want to.
1895801,eng,You can wait in this room.
7502472,eng,I know that Tom doesn't know that Mary doesn't have to do that.
6246748,eng,Tom said some things will never change.
5233132,eng,"The grumbling Brits have left for good. God bless the European Union, which will become stronger as a result of this."
1185314,eng,I told you you had to go home. Why are you still here?
6523454,eng,Tom may be having a heart attack.
2942898,eng,What's the minimum salary in Scotland?
6423569,eng,Mary did what she thought was right.
6491577,eng,I wonder whether Tom and Mary are still desperate to do that.
2539656,eng,Tom poured some milk into the glass.
6466807,eng,Sami admitted to the affair.
322214,eng,"To tell the truth, she no longer loves him."
6731332,eng,Do you have a calculator I could borrow?
57320,eng,This room can hold three hundred people.
7515339,eng,I know Tom can do that better than Mary.
6098701,eng,Do you think this strategy will work?
1192041,eng,Can you explain it better?
5337288,eng,Tom banged his knees on the glass coffee table.
260653,eng,I couldn't shake off his hand.
313950,eng,She made the children clean up their own rooms.
6809561,eng,Sami was walking to the auditorium.
6272776,eng,Tom is a little older than Mary.
7230826,eng,I don't think that it would be wise to do that.
7543740,eng,Tom and his son worked together.
246242,eng,"Yes, you can indicate everything you see."
6338805,eng,Do you think Tom is difficult to get along with?
2822731,eng,I like this answer.
282160,eng,Don't make fun of old people.
7253596,eng,Sami hated us.
7023353,eng,"The only road connecting his home to the local market is very narrow, a one-way track, built by piling dirt between two plots of farmland."
4606430,eng,People often confuse the difference between an argument and a debate.
5850922,eng,I hope I wasn't boring.
5756577,eng,This is a bad thing.
7406541,eng,They're reading in their bedrooms.
886920,eng,"She advised him to take a long holiday, so he immediately quit work and took a trip around the world."
6259578,eng,Tom told Mary that John was a good friend of his.
6983341,eng,I am not a teacher. I am just a student.
5649225,eng,I've been trying to talk to you for over a month.
2641468,eng,Tom helped Mary off with her jacket.
6575258,eng,Sami is sitting in a prison cell.
6848979,eng,It's going to be difficult to find somebody to replace Tom.
2882150,eng,"If you are not willing to learn, no one can help you. If you are determined to learn, no one can stop you."
5758373,eng,This upsets me.
5157696,eng,Why does everyone think I am stupid?
2548674,eng,I'm still in shock.
2900761,eng,A snowstorm is raging in the northern Golan Heights and in the high peaks of the Galilee.
6389482,eng,Sami didn't flaunt any subject.
2234180,eng,What's your price?
6436445,eng,How much money do you usually carry?
3068919,eng,Your actions may be overly precipitous.
6102565,eng,Aren't you bothered by this?
53370,eng,Jimmy was hurt in a traffic accident.
7503834,eng,I know that Tom knew that he shouldn't do that by himself.
6838549,eng,I know Tom was unfazed by that.
1094180,eng,Tom enjoyed looking at the paintings hanging on Mary's wall.
3183619,eng,Tom told me he wanted to quit the company.
5274508,eng,Tom took a picture of himself flexing his abs in front of the mirror.
5936733,eng,Everyone but Tom is planning to be there.
7511240,eng,"You do know Tom and Mary broke up, don't you?"
6504495,eng,Do you know the song Tom and Mary want you to sing?
6698485,eng,I have to clean my home.
6306154,eng,Sami liked to talk to female co-workers.
6708913,eng,Sami could have done that crime.
7168365,eng,I think that Tom has serious problems at home.
7541981,eng,Tom doesn't want anything bad to happen.
3272650,eng,She is not going to explain it to them.
7515264,eng,I know Tom knew why Mary didn't do that.
7163323,eng,I thought it would be fun to live in Australia for a year or two.
5847009,eng,I'll show Tom how to do that.
7184051,eng,I doubt very seriously Tom will be suspicious.
3406678,eng,He was painted like a clown.
3360518,eng,Tom walks quickly.
5147565,eng,I see a girl.
6237190,eng,I don't think they'll permit Tom to do that.
3204601,eng,You never told me that you didn't like Boston.
877870,eng,I like this wallpaper of Marilyn Monroe you have on your laptop because it reminds me a lot of you when you lay your little eyes on me.
5275680,eng,I was just thinking about it.
5851943,eng,I like camping.
7294406,eng,Sami has positive memories from that neighborhood.
2611761,eng,We have written a book.
273425,eng,The ship discharged its cargo in Panama.
48352,eng,We have to study the matter.
281603,eng,Japan has much trade with the USA.
7731379,eng,Tom is going to have to do something he doesn't want to do.
3730143,eng,I lied every time Tom asked me about Mary.
7395307,eng,He was astonished by what he saw.
6891911,eng,Tom's new bicycle is metallic red.
7246400,eng,Sami was escorted out.
2218322,eng,You're on television.
1943927,eng,Show me some respect.
1069273,eng,She has a ring worth more than she can imagine.
6439957,eng,How did you become blind?
2541424,eng,I'm a little curious about that.
3439549,eng,Should I really do it?
7316986,eng,Dihyia gave a correction to Uqba.
66364,eng,Some day you will come to realize the importance of saving.
7147433,eng,Sami peeked inside the attic.
6090570,eng,Give me the shield.
6428580,eng,Mary rarely uses her phone.
6646533,eng,Tom told me he's ready.
6493273,eng,Was it you who was supposed to tell Tom and Mary they needed to do that?
4573684,eng,You must take the apple.
1096141,eng,Just because Tom said he had never met Mary doesn't mean it's true.
2361272,eng,I don't know what's in there.
36668,eng,I must help her at any cost.
7159980,eng,I wish to study in Australia.
6957431,eng,I was not surprised.
7544857,eng,Ask her to stay.
267027,eng,"At first, it is difficult."
4666175,eng,Tom could've come with me.
530066,eng,My sister is very intelligent.
3722559,eng,Tom pondered the question for a while.
6519871,eng,Tom and Mary like their new jobs a lot.
2760331,eng,That hut's floor is of bamboo.
7202084,eng,Sami doesn't talk to Layla.
6733210,eng,I wasn't enjoying myself.
2451079,eng,Tom didn't begin to study French until he was thirty years old.
6649103,eng,Tom said that he thought he'd be able to buy everything he needed for about $300.
4515216,eng,Your software is up-to-date.
6994430,eng,"He was a mercenary, but preferred to call himself a soldier of fortune."
3010195,eng,He doesn't really care about me.
7168351,eng,I think that Tom has high blood pressure.
7159108,eng,I went home and told my wife about the job I'd been offered in Australia.
6491417,eng,I wonder whether Tom and Mary were here yesterday.
6415267,eng,Mary thought she heard a mouse in the kitchen.
2457454,eng,Does anybody want to take a walk to the beach?
6270582,eng,Tom didn't think Mary was surprised.
6659060,eng,Tom and I'll be here for the next few hours.
239748,eng,Language acquisition requires creativity.
52528,eng,John inherited a large fortune.
2682624,eng,It was Angela who put William on to Steven.
1234436,eng,You look awesome!
2347033,eng,Is it too early for red wine?
4426620,eng,"In fact, he was lying."
3348081,eng,You have to get closer.
838500,eng,She was only 18 when she graduated from university.
5725783,eng,It's something we're excited about.
5242368,eng,My daughter Brigitta is a seamstress.
6251743,eng,Tom said he thought Mary would need at least $300 to buy everything she needed.
2638933,eng,"Wake me up at six, please."
2408511,eng,I think we've made our point.
1513673,eng,It's not a fish.
5136898,eng,You're really looking much better.
7409375,eng,They said that they wanted answers.
7400306,eng,She didn't say why she did that.
49392,eng,It seemed that that house was small if it was compared with the cottage which he lived in even recently.
3920420,eng,They adore him.
7380250,eng,Mary kept her head above water.
6345986,eng,"You're still a mechanic, aren't you?"
4529169,eng,I appreciate everything you've done for us.
7178710,eng,Tom said that Mary is very hungry every day when she gets home.
6374304,eng,Get off me. Don't touch me.
7517214,eng,I know that I'm going to be arrested.
6424233,eng,"Mary doesn't really know, does she?"
297569,eng,He showed me the way to the station.
5404510,eng,Are you going to tell me the truth?
7237736,eng,Sami was fucking in his room.
5036405,eng,That doesn't scare me in the least.
6499605,eng,What makes you think that Tom and Mary are going to be late again?
6776722,eng,I don't have enough time to do that before I go home.
3333875,eng,Please join us.
3202093,eng,Can you tell me what this is about?
4133416,eng,I can only stay with you for just a few days.
313942,eng,She sent her children off to school.
2724626,eng,"Aren't you afraid of death? ""Not a bit. I'd rather die than drink that awful medicine."""
294912,eng,He has a good position in a government office.
278741,eng,I worked all night.
899477,eng,My shoulder hurts.
3171407,eng,Tom had his sweater on wrong side out.
3920325,eng,They slowly approached him.
7409355,eng,They said they wanted to try to win.
5618304,eng,I can't swim now as well as I used to be able to.
5175109,eng,I just wanted to do it.
2422,eng,I'll pay by cheque.
7198338,eng,It's not difficult to learn French.
3593396,eng,I ought to go.
6232268,eng,Tom needs to make sure that he has everything he needs.
7390812,eng,He reluctantly took his seat.
6665328,eng,I don't think Tom is tough.
5797542,eng,Your son is an angel.
3729731,eng,Tom has had a medical emergency.
4666493,eng,Here comes the good part.
2258395,eng,He left the class because he was feeling sick.
5907710,eng,Tom told Mary that he'd help her with her homework.
954772,eng,"You may not be in the mood to hear this now, but I need to tell you something important."
6576046,eng,I need an excuse.
5725226,eng,"When you're not with me, I sometimes feel lonely."
51517,eng,The Smiths had their house painted white.
244240,eng,The judge called for a recess of two hours.
3919435,eng,Who's going to believe you?
2647676,eng,I'm not really busy.
885005,eng,She was in the Americas last month.
2044610,eng,"I'm happy to be here, Tom."
6348997,eng,Tom is probably eating right now.
5852046,eng,How on earth could this be a surprise?
7396237,eng,She pretended she was still asleep.
264336,eng,Can you come at ten on May second?
6528101,eng,Tom doesn't plan to go anywhere tomorrow.
5212534,eng,I wasn't able to rent a car.
2111905,eng,Don't scream.
3738713,eng,How long ago was it?
7386767,eng,She's sound asleep in her room.
1040542,eng,Tom told Mary everything she needed to know.
2542725,eng,We wouldn't like to lose you.
6937135,eng,The driver hit our car and then drove off.
3093597,eng,Tom has hurt his leg.
7473636,eng,They didn't regret doing what they did.
6272641,eng,Tom said he's seen Mary do that.
6733487,eng,"Tom has lived in Boston for thirty years, but he still doesn't seem to know the city well."
7198161,eng,Sami and Layla survived the disease.
6039681,eng,Whoever left this door ajar definitely did it on purpose.
6659138,eng,"Tom is bossy, but Mary isn't."
6621353,eng,Snap to it.
7136887,eng,I'm glad that we didn't wait another day.
682466,eng,It's a wonder they're still awake.
7209247,eng,Sami needs to go outside.
6432657,eng,Tom learned how to drive when he was a teenager.
7520388,eng,Tom said that this is healthy.
6049479,eng,Empty your briefcase.
6227857,eng,I think Tom won't be worried.
2954521,eng,You have a decision to make.
5293401,eng,I don't think Tom is going away.
6496747,eng,Tom and Mary won't likely tell John what they want him to do.
6929401,eng,The breakfast cafe will kill me sooner than later.
6436510,eng,Tom wanted me to do that with Mary.
5731816,eng,Tom whipped Mary with his belt.
7396733,eng,He told me that he wasn't bored.
6927557,eng,Tom is very unpredictable when he's been drinking.
3822502,eng,How much will you pay me?
315878,eng,She won't take an airplane for fear of a crash.
6694039,eng,Sami and Layla played scrabble.
2669419,eng,Gluttony is one of the seven deadly sins.
6250668,eng,Did you know that Tom did that?
5214648,eng,Tom thinks he knows what to do.
7169036,eng,I think that Tom is too weak to do that.
258207,eng,I oiled my bicycle.
4001783,eng,He's the top of his English class.
7169659,eng,I think that Tom would like Mary to do that for John.
5271060,eng,You're an ignorant fool.
6414641,eng,Mary said that she did her homework by herself.
257803,eng,He read a most interesting novel yesterday.
7213131,eng,I'm pretty blind.
694526,eng,I have bad eyesight.
7390622,eng,He put down his paintbrush.
7735208,eng,You won't need to do that by yourselves.
807587,eng,Fear of communism was very strong at that time.
1890879,eng,I'll be very discreet.
6500563,eng,Tom and Mary haven't eaten any food for the past three days.
1248757,eng,The dodo is an already extinct species.
4091291,eng,Tom always does that for me.
7383062,eng,She likes talking about herself.
1029141,eng,Tom doesn't know Mary.
1883378,eng,Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with our privacy policies.
5119709,eng,What do you feel now?
6265772,eng,Tom and I are on our honeymoon.
6491705,eng,I wonder whether Tom and Mary are prepared to do that.
6443411,eng,I would be more than happy to pay.
7140933,eng,Sami is standing here.
6503305,eng,Haven't you asked Tom and Mary why they didn't do that?
6500996,eng,I don't suppose you happen to know where Tom and Mary live?
24676,eng,What are you reading?
4012840,eng,What am I supposed to do with them?
4140622,eng,"What's the Spanish for ""your face""?"
7126788,eng,"In 2013, Tom moved his family to Boston."
6063902,eng,This town is boring.
6491330,eng,It looks as though Tom and Mary are waiting for somebody.
5848459,eng,Tom makes mistakes every time he speaks French.
7444428,eng,They told me that they believed that.
814885,eng,The key to a situation often is in the neighbor's door.
2685423,eng,There are few passengers on this train.
7402997,eng,He said he knows the rules.
1177565,eng,Tom has to protect himself.
6264235,eng,Tom's room needs to be cleaned.
7245722,eng,Sami didn't allow his roommate to use his fridge.
3916488,eng,I gave him some money.
6083577,eng,Layla is ignoring me.
6528810,eng,I like both volleyball and basketball.
3673487,eng,How many apples does it take to make three apple pies?
7294342,eng,Sami gave Layla a book.
6058375,eng,No one wanted to be seen with me.
7507427,eng,I know Tom doesn't know why Mary needed to do that.
6123030,eng,Mary was the only girl Tom ever really loved.
3216317,eng,This woman is a prostitute.
6048553,eng,"You know what to expect, don't you?"
6254901,eng,I've been told not do that again.
6427426,eng,I'll ask Mary what she thinks.
7506239,eng,I know Tom didn't know that I didn't want to do that.
3390204,eng,No one has the right to tell you otherwise.
7379076,eng,"Mary is enjoying this, isn't she?"
5726702,eng,Tom could very well be our next boss.
7476080,eng,They got their teeth whitened.
5661469,eng,She's on her way to Thailand.
406047,eng,I would offer you a coffee if you had the time.
2303417,eng,He was hit by lightning.
298260,eng,I expect him to pass the examination.
5162667,eng,I'm not your commanding officer.
7168357,eng,I think that Tom has never done that by himself before.
6500306,eng,I didn't know who Tom and Mary were planning to see in Boston.
816084,eng,Even in rain and snow I enjoy mountain-climbing.
2819585,eng,I will scrutinize you closely.
6763300,eng,Science and mathematics transcend borders.
4529826,eng,I appreciate you telling me.
6250865,eng,Would it be OK if I did that today?
3725672,eng,They were collecting information.
5101676,eng,He is in limbo.
281342,eng,You must remove your shoes when you enter a Japanese house.
2052884,eng,I'm getting pregnant tonight.
2758993,eng,"Hello, I would like some fresh orange juice."
435410,eng,It's too large.
2016666,eng,I want you to look out the window.
7156762,eng,Tom made it clear that he didn't want to go to Australia with us.
4502114,eng,Tom is a bit shorter than Mary.
2643299,eng,Tom and Mary weren't invited.
1867792,eng,Tom wants to help.
6335620,eng,Please find out when Tom plans to stay here with us.
6266172,eng,I thought that I'd do that.
4017254,eng,There are no other alternatives.
6666640,eng,I'm doing that already.
5380210,eng,I think Tom understands all that.
6575345,eng,I love coleslaw.
6491841,eng,"I want to know whether Tom and Mary need to do that, too."
539138,eng,Do you care to hazard a guess?
7401399,eng,He has said he won't do that.
1937610,eng,"The rain has let up, so we can begin."
16336,eng,"If you studied hard, you would get good marks."
7243402,eng,Sami doesn't think Layla is a hairstylist.
2940643,eng,I picked up an abandoned dog.
6511182,eng,I told Tom and Mary that they shouldn't do that.
2056794,eng,Have you ever tried not being rude to people?
16681,eng,Where did you go last Sunday?
6150373,eng,People were shocked when he cited a supermarket tabloid as a reputable newspaper.
6664115,eng,We'll have a meeting on Monday.
1014484,eng,"Last night I was too tired to cook a proper meal, so I just ate instant noodles."
1845480,eng,Tell Tom I have to work late tonight.
2880965,eng,She uploaded a video.
6118653,eng,It's hard to do that.
954779,eng,You might want to try working out a bit.
5228815,eng,Tom said he didn't like Mary anymore.
5641853,eng,I'm going to miss being here.
7471205,eng,Tom and Mary realized that they couldn't talk.
6994572,eng,Tom started acting strangely.
7374809,eng,Mary said she didn't feel like eating.
2953543,eng,We appreciate the advice.
5850510,eng,Neither Tom nor Mary has ever been to Boston.
2912204,eng,That's commonplace.
2326001,eng,I feel like I'm going mad.
7522012,eng,I know Tom hurt you.
25365,eng,A bad workman quarrels with his tools.
4664999,eng,Tom didn't seem very impressed.
7378264,eng,"Mary is still homesick, isn't she?"
4761250,eng,"Yesterday night, I was almost bitten to death by the laboratory mosquitoes."
6866232,eng,I think that something bad might happen.
6233091,eng,I know that doing this must seem dangerous to you.
6588576,eng,Do you have a first aid kit?
6339485,eng,Tom will probably be doing that early tomorrow morning.
6407560,eng,Mary doesn't know what Tom wants her to buy him for his birthday.
6532392,eng,You've been hurt.
6078578,eng,Is anyone in the house?
4271056,eng,"Even the wealth of the wide sea will be diminished, if the cloud that has drawn (its waters) up gives them not back again (in rain)"
3915908,eng,Give us a call.
7402022,eng,He said that he didn't mind.
6653642,eng,Tom said he hopes that you like doing that.
2264721,eng,Be careful that the thread doesn't break.
4494765,eng,How is Tom different?
6228927,eng,Don't forget to tell Mary that she doesn't have to do that.
6418061,eng,Mary didn't realize she was being followed.
807456,eng,The election results were extremely close.
6524708,eng,"I don't have a chain saw, but I know someone who does."
7113190,eng,You're very compassionate.
6866336,eng,We've been very busy for the last few days.
7185963,eng,I'm sorry that I can't go.
5904689,eng,I only had three dollars with me at that time.
5729476,eng,I never take anyone for granted.
3405428,eng,"Tom was going to sign it, but decided not to."
7376717,eng,"Mary is back from Boston, isn't she?"
526658,eng,Close your book.
6884619,eng,Let's do it right away.
6055968,eng,Layla decided to silence the witnesses.
5922063,eng,We all have to die sooner or later.
6772231,eng,Tom screams.
6958605,eng,We did that well.
1395966,eng,The weather report is defective.
55940,eng,I'm sure it was just a terrible accident.
6584715,eng,We had a pleasant time.
60195,eng,I am going to swim a lot this summer.
6245301,eng,Tom said he's been asked not to do that.
6236875,eng,"So far, Tom is the only one who's done that."
2954145,eng,What kind of music do you like?
6237468,eng,I didn't know that what I'd done was illegal.
6505897,eng,Do Tom and Mary still think that's what you want?
4902731,eng,Do you have a contingency plan in place?
862348,eng,What exactly are you doing?
7134542,eng,I'm hoping to finish in the top ten.
277655,eng,"Look carefully, or you will miss Jane's mother."
278734,eng,Philosophy is not so difficult a subject as you imagine it is.
2360230,eng,I've run out of milk.
2198601,eng,I think she's hiding something from me.
7518526,eng,I knew that Tom was a bit confused.
6492211,eng,Do you know if Tom and Mary are doing that now?
2952981,eng,"If Tom were here, we'd be having more fun."
6653626,eng,Tom said he hopes that you won't let Mary drive.
6728649,eng,I wasn't able to play tennis as often last year as I wanted to.
7135187,eng,Sami can do it.
6869757,eng,Tom wouldn't have asked you to do that if he could have done it himself.
3915604,eng,I thought you hated them.
6651399,eng,"Tom said that he wasn't interested in Mary, but he seemed to always be looking towards the side of the room where she was."
5740601,eng,Our car is being repaired.
2952708,eng,I'd say that narrows it down quite a bit.
7227930,eng,I don't think that what Tom said was true.
7304385,eng,"Water springs out of a fountain, flows downwards in a brook, runs in a beck, stands in a pond, glides in the stream, is whirled about in a whirlpool and causes fens."
6124264,eng,Tom is the person to talk to.
7380619,eng,Mary told me she needed space.
6579254,eng,Her ambition pushed her to work hard.
3171012,eng,We've already talked to Tom three times about that matter.
4471296,eng,Only an ardent fan could create such a faithful pastiche of the artist's works.
541980,eng,If you keep at it you will eventually succeed.
1650573,eng,I waited for an hour in the meeting room.
6336802,eng,I wonder if Tom is really serious.
6601913,eng,He doesn't like baguettes. It's always quinoa with him.
3228043,eng,She prefers the quiet.
59884,eng,It is the behavior of the control group that is important in this connection.
26498,eng,Our store hours are from 10 to 7.
3393009,eng,Get ready for bed.
5738108,eng,Tom was shot multiple times.
292131,eng,He ran so fast that we couldn't catch up with him.
5515501,eng,Tom wanted to expand his business.
3728368,eng,They're getting away with it.
7390520,eng,She put on her coat and gloves.
5418382,eng,It'll break.
3086157,eng,This happens more than two times per week.
6097423,eng,Layla was Sami's first crush.
5937747,eng,Old age can be tough.
7146393,eng,Sami lived with two roommates.
3360378,eng,You've seen what we can do.
5688055,eng,I don't know if it's good enough.
6855568,eng,You lucky devil.
7371389,eng,"Can I have some more rice, please?"
1362815,eng,What you have to do tomorrow - do today; what you have to eat today - eat tomorrow.
5859549,eng,I'm about your size.
6662871,eng,I don't like to talk about my job.
529786,eng,"If he hadn't wasted time, he'd be finished by now."
2359495,eng,I haven't even told Tom.
35890,eng,I'm dying to go to New York.
7192048,eng,I don't think that Tom knows Mary is in Australia.
6382914,eng,Sami and Layla talked outside.
3618581,eng,I don't like being cold.
2644510,eng,"Thank you for coming, Tom."
1042265,eng,We got used to late-hour work.
7130056,eng,Tom and Mary are looking forward to your coming.
6826518,eng,"When I return in the evening, I'm always very tired."
5649489,eng,I take a maintenance pain pill for arthritis.
2955658,eng,Tom and I started at the same time.
5512785,eng,We're extremely optimistic.
1694318,eng,Invite your friend for dinner.
59353,eng,This lake is among the deepest in the country.
6348131,eng,Tom isn't very likely to ever win.
1442042,eng,She was too tired to speak.
2494001,eng,My shoes are not comfortable.
6521145,eng,Do Tom and Mary often come here?
1027728,eng,Tom will give Mary the details later.
3318843,eng,"Come on, Tom. Let's go."
6330593,eng,Europe's VIRGO detector has detected gravitational waves for the first time.
6709548,eng,She fell madly in love with him.
6795003,eng,How can I explain this to Tom?
321552,eng,Everything went black.
6628219,eng,I own a dairy farm.
2826740,eng,That sounds like a literal translation from the English.
804299,eng,Monroe received 65 votes.
6522041,eng,Do Tom and Mary like tomatoes?
6195536,eng,Make your way to the dining table! Dinner is served.
2276892,eng,"That sounds strange, doesn't it?"
1160604,eng,"When we arrived at the port, the wind subsided."
2863052,eng,They will fix it.
5708680,eng,You! Speak!
4728332,eng,Excuse me. Where's the subway?
700794,eng,We need you to confirm your attendance because places are limited.
2733656,eng,We all did well.
2294054,eng,I think you are incorrect.
3912963,eng,We're not like them.
2300680,eng,I can do this all day.
2641091,eng,Tom sat on the motorcycle behind Mary.
2488205,eng,I couldn't forget Marika's voice for days.
6349930,eng,We both know Tom did that.
3413064,eng,Tom's porch light is on.
7184256,eng,"The last time that Tom gave a concert in Australia, only 300 people came."
6348391,eng,Wouldn't it be better to eat now?
6490641,eng,Tom and Mary said they didn't expect anyone to do that.
2015113,eng,Are you sure you want to be here?
3428316,eng,Tom was fearless.
6013226,eng,How do I know I'm not the only person who experiences consciousness?
7146363,eng,Sami's eyes were sunken in.
5664717,eng,"Where I come from, it's a tradition to name one's first born Tom, and second son John."
7260294,eng,Sami said the food was disgusting.
3927956,eng,The hostage-takers planted explosives all around the compound.
1577983,eng,How do you read this kanji?
6387567,eng,Sami saw the right Farid gave to Layla.
255016,eng,I have just finished one third of my assignment.
997023,eng,I want to give him a present for his birthday.
2218206,eng,You're mocking me.
7539364,eng,Tom forgot to tell Mary what time the concert started.
2546091,eng,I'll come see you later.
6238456,eng,Didn't you know Tom used to work in Boston?
2366877,eng,"His job title change was considered a lateral move, possibly a demotion, and certainly not a promotion."
5849169,eng,How did you know that was my favorite one?
6254067,eng,Tom would've done that by himself if Mary hadn't been there.
4083392,eng,Brazil's population is much larger than that of other Portuguese-speaking countries.
5747764,eng,Everything looks right.
7589944,eng,Why are you so mean?
3563798,eng,"Now, why are you here?"
7240388,eng,I know you'll be able to do that.
2545679,eng,Who told you to do that?
2548480,eng,What's in your bag?
3905636,eng,I told them I'd be right back.
6651393,eng,Tom said that he wasn't likely to see Mary today.
6888693,eng,She went to the cabinet of maps and unrolled one.
6420226,eng,Mary realized she had been unreasonable.
3907695,eng,Is that them?
6616518,eng,I had to walk off of the mountain with a bad sprain.
7493949,eng,Where did Tom hide my passport?
7218170,eng,Tom was obviously lonely.
7401815,eng,He says he'll come tomorrow.
3723900,eng,"Hey, now we're talking."
2300710,eng,I can get a doctor for you.
7512124,eng,Tom didn't realize that we could to do that.
509917,eng,My name is Farshad.
7178330,eng,Sami told Layla his number.
5320958,eng,Has anyone read that book?
7401134,eng,She said she thought you'd win.
7242136,eng,Sami purchased the flight ticket in Cairo.
3444593,eng,Tom is about as tall as me.
323721,eng,The blind nurse devoted herself to caring for the elderly.
5738253,eng,I mean that very sincerely.
63891,eng,Don't put the saddle on the wrong horse.
7189772,eng,Sami's dog is so aggressive.
2011690,eng,I want you to grow up.
6505812,eng,I wonder if Tom and Mary knew they needed to do that.
7176419,eng,Tom knows that he shouldn't have done that.
6333863,eng,Porsena was an Etruscan king.
5824751,eng,"This morning when I left the asylum I felt so ashamed because I had to wear this horrid old wincey dress. All the orphans had to wear them, you know."
2064903,eng,There's something I need to know.
4666632,eng,That would take all day.
2014284,eng,I don't want to turn myself in.
7129874,eng,Tom locked his son in a closet without food or water for a week.
5553594,eng,Tom threw his cigarette on the floor.
7405076,eng,He said that he's safe.
6648784,eng,Tom said that he thought that Mary might not be allowed to do that by herself.
6518966,eng,I hope Tom and Mary were listening.
3161838,eng,Tom offered his help to us.
535849,eng,"You like her, don't you?"
1029713,eng,Tom asked Mary if she wanted something to drink.
6258650,eng,I wasn't able to do that today.
6436441,eng,I can't remember what happened next.
2942446,eng,Today I've seen tens of gloomy angry faces glancing at me.
281887,eng,We saw cows grazing in the meadow.
3908377,eng,Do you want to tell her?
261407,eng,"I am not tired. ""Neither am I."""
6237913,eng,I thought Tom would be embarrassed by that.
3045599,eng,We won't be leaving town before spring.
6649208,eng,Tom said that he thought that he might not be permitted to do that by himself.
65324,eng,Edison was an inventive genius of the United States.
19233,eng,No one but a strong man is fit for the post.
5453226,eng,Tom is too young to do that.
3371541,eng,I tried to understand what had happened.
6252721,eng,The last three days have been hot.
7376726,eng,"Mary is an amateur boxer, isn't she?"
6900284,eng,Marie willingly gets up early.
6942702,eng,Don't give Tom anything else.
2743689,eng,They shoved me into the lockers.
6494547,eng,Tom and Mary don't really enjoy doing that as much as they used to.
71914,eng,Einstein's theory of relativity is Greek to me.
7396969,eng,She says she's done nothing wrong.
2643064,eng,Can't you do that on your own?
489697,eng,I really like this skirt. Can I try it on?
7209075,eng,Sami wasn't hostile with the security guard.
1127416,eng,Copernicus turned from a person into a personification.
6270049,eng,Tom said he should do that.
6407016,eng,Mary couldn't go to Boston with us because she didn't have enough money.
6258896,eng,I know what those are used for.
6048588,eng,Tom didn't show up for the appointment.
5085944,eng,It's a very strange process.
3444546,eng,Tom didn't exactly agree with me.
2042224,eng,We walk along the lakeside.
5744497,eng,The public didn't buy it.
3731491,eng,What do you say you join me for dinner?
7414147,eng,What a lovely thing a rose is!
1904492,eng,I wish you'd quit doing what you're doing.
238909,eng,Ken's really a chip off the old block.
5757878,eng,Tom loves rituals.
36980,eng,Anyhow I will see him.
6503440,eng,Why don't we see if Tom and Mary want to go with us?
3903665,eng,I have to go meet with her.
7473863,eng,They need to lower their expectations.
1768727,eng,This should be fun.
3573199,eng,Looks like Mary will be getting married next month.
3403501,eng,Tom seems to be unhappy.
3307254,eng,Everybody was staring at him.
676549,eng,Add salt to taste.
7270049,eng,Sami called the cops on Layla and her friends.
7408527,eng,They turned themselves in.
2640208,eng,Tom crossed the road without looking both ways.
237948,eng,Business is slow.
2628940,eng,I can still remember a few words in Spanish.
6507406,eng,Tom and Mary said they wouldn't attend the meeting.
5938621,eng,You're twice as old as me.
733675,eng,"He is not just kind, but honest too."
7388462,eng,She has to travel a lot for her job.
7437104,eng,Tom and Mary said they were very sleepy.
2587644,eng,I'll see her today.
4636685,eng,"If you need anything, just give me a holler."
5146834,eng,Someone began to follow Tom.
248012,eng,We elected Jim captain of our baseball team.
3813020,eng,Sometimes it can't be avoided.
7476001,eng,They say that they've met you.
4596904,eng,I love lazy Sundays.
4499437,eng,My legs are hurting.
303272,eng,He has three dependents to support.
3496330,eng,Do you want some bacon and eggs?
3728192,eng,I had an awful night.
6037898,eng,Love is a luxury I simply can't afford.
6448531,eng,Sami didn't say too much.
308085,eng,Do you know who she is?
6324494,eng,Sami had a snap.
7240078,eng,I know that it's highly unlikely anybody can help me.
21221,eng,He was a stock-market tycoon until the bears got him.
1025124,eng,Tom is a veteran.
7542187,eng,Tom knew where the best mushrooms grew.
7396860,eng,She told me she did nothing wrong.
2360016,eng,I've never been this scared before.
6135598,eng,"I feel very bad, I must see a doctor."
3686502,eng,I turned the page.
7681750,eng,Give!
2329665,eng,I got your address from Tom.
6699483,eng,Sami discovered all his money was gone.
242977,eng,I am busy today.
6650369,eng,Tom said that he didn't know that Mary couldn't do that.
6157602,eng,I do not like that thought.
6094415,eng,Aren't you seeing anyone?
6043791,eng,Layla had plenty of enemies.
6118940,eng,We do not tolerate cowardice.
5858862,eng,I found Tom a job.
1890998,eng,I'm here because I want to be.
26804,eng,The rain spoiled our picnic.
5077491,eng,It's totally worth a shot.
5881672,eng,They would like to see me.
2834409,eng,"Death is a disgusting thing that nature has to hide, and it does it well."
7218397,eng,Tom told me that he thought that Mary was furious.
5833205,eng,How did you support yourself before you got this job?
322652,eng,Could I have a sample taste?
3820096,eng,I think you can do better than that.
7706622,eng,Have Tom and Mary ever come on time?
6076491,eng,Would you tell me why you did that?
6274139,eng,You're a real fool.
6415385,eng,Mary said she's glad you were able to do that.
2958748,eng,Tom wondered why everyone was staring at him.
3594048,eng,That didn't even occur to me.
5514190,eng,I think I already wrote to you.
313626,eng,She was good at mathematics in high school.
5871830,eng,I don't know who Fadil is.
50274,eng,Is there much water in the dam?
1144479,eng,Can you answer this?
2081284,eng,Time to begin.
427784,eng,You should phone your mother as soon as you can.
3818962,eng,I'm just warming up.
6985495,eng,I had better digitize these photos so I don't lose them.
6097488,eng,Layla wanted to get rid of the evidence.
290545,eng,He wanted to commit the whole message to memory.
3737100,eng,I thought you were going to be gone all day.
6497840,eng,I think Tom and Mary shouldn't tell John that they did that.
2330105,eng,I guess Tom has been here all day.
6652092,eng,Tom said that he wanted to see Mary win.
7515011,eng,I think that Tom has spent time in jail.
634045,eng,We thought that the message was true.
1138317,eng,Yawning in a meeting is not polite.
6506229,eng,Tom and Mary say they don't know why John does that.
6665057,eng,The person Tom is talking to is Mary.
7511732,eng,I know Tom is a few pounds lighter than Mary.
7177281,eng,Tom said that Mary wasn't planning to go on her own.
3919582,eng,You can't yell at him.
1609284,eng,I'm going to Berlin to visit my friend.
3186786,eng,"Sometimes, I think I'm in a nuthouse."
3657572,eng,The association has thirty members.
62027,eng,"Between you and me, I think our boss is stupid."
6271262,eng,Tom is in the county jail.
72373,eng,"One day in July, we went to the sea."
276455,eng,No one should desert his friends.
3819377,eng,Maybe you should call Tom.
7408194,eng,They aren't worried about their grades.
397479,eng,I don't know exactly how many visitors there were. I think three hundred something.
7356137,eng,He buys cigarettes.
2890444,eng,Put it in your pocket.
2436089,eng,That was absolutely awesome!
658859,eng,The President of France will visit Japan next month.
2879267,eng,She purchased an apartment.
4853404,eng,Antibiotics can't destroy viruses.
1686009,eng,"If at least two people are great, then no one is the only great person."
1925367,eng,Are you a registered voter?
470433,eng,I missed you very much.
4632264,eng,He was the only one in the room.
7443874,eng,Tom and Mary told me that they want to win.
32599,eng,I haven't finished my homework yet.
6274354,eng,Tom and I are rivals.
265783,eng,The young couple fell in love with each other very soon.
2917214,eng,"We speak low german, do you?"
3287071,eng,I sense that something is wrong.
5296992,eng,She left Osaka yesterday.
1927941,eng,"When he heard the news, he turned pale."
5643107,eng,I could've played a lot better.
61465,eng,Come over here and join us.
7191026,eng,Sami had to do an assignment.
7137168,eng,We're supposed to follow these rules.
6490759,eng,Tom and Mary put down their books.
2272871,eng,Tom is a shark.
3619164,eng,I thought I heard the doorbell.
6229386,eng,I don't think Tom is stingy.
7403608,eng,She said that she felt good.
7154843,eng,Tom said that he thought that Mary was having a good time in Australia.
4680100,eng,The coffee tastes like wash water.
2549811,eng,It's for us.
1192097,eng,It's impossible to cross the river by swimming. It's too wide!
6531727,eng,Tom organized this party.
302032,eng,He couldn't move and had to call for help.
5822592,eng,He didn't show any remorse for his actions.
322102,eng,Reading books is very interesting.
3920267,eng,Let's go and ask her.
6268953,eng,Tom doesn't know that Mary is unhappy.
2730108,eng,"As a result of the storm, he didn't arrive."
3684481,eng,"I will, but on one condition."
31409,eng,Will you permit us to leave now?
3921237,eng,Tom is usually busier than I am.
6336481,eng,I wonder if Tom really was at school today.
261133,eng,I made sure to not let her do such a thing again.
3422102,eng,Tom tried to look calm.
7393535,eng,She got what she deserved in the end.
7437056,eng,Tom and Mary said that they didn't need money.
807151,eng,Such measures were not necessary.
1950863,eng,I can't believe Tom hasn't called.
7399035,eng,She lied about why she was fired.
1547665,eng,The village is easy of access.
3909643,eng,I didn't send him anywhere.
6431655,eng,Tom said he'll be ready to go by the time you get here.
239482,eng,Freedom of speech is now taken as a matter of course.
5263795,eng,I'm hoping to win.
268028,eng,The boy came back to life.
40581,eng,I guess that would be all right.
2954555,eng,You have to do your job.
2797444,eng,An honest life is pleasing to God.
257299,eng,I have an old bicycle.
36035,eng,We have to avoid the nuclear war by all means.
6346847,eng,Tom doesn't know who has to do that.
7176767,eng,Tom said that you just need to relax.
1083979,eng,I love walking along the river.
2025918,eng,Is there anything you want to tell me?
5008538,eng,They began arguing over money.
908454,eng,For we must consider that we shall be a city upon a hill.
6502775,eng,Tom and Mary must've forgotten what they promised John.
19903,eng,The guests are all gone.
7382063,eng,Mary says she's healthy.
2539917,eng,You'll wish you had studied harder.
1961773,eng,I thought you were sleeping.
5207769,eng,I told Tom to just relax.
6506625,eng,Tom and Mary live in the house where they were born.
6713717,eng,Sami had a tough guy exterior.
6652293,eng,Tom said that he tried to cheer Mary up.
2236926,eng,Tom is wonderful.
5206949,eng,Tom didn't want me to leave.
6918875,eng,Tom is really good at playing the guitar.
29613,eng,Would you like another apple?
1331882,eng,Make him feel ashamed of his laziness.
5747092,eng,We were still in shock.
2273055,eng,Tom is breathing hard.
252862,eng,I wanted to go back to your village.
6433017,eng,Mary said she thought Tom would likely not cry.
282443,eng,A tall woman came along.
7137590,eng,Sami doesn't want Layla swimming without her bathing cap.
7470978,eng,Tom and Mary say that they had to study French.
3819936,eng,The police arrested the thief.
2107660,eng,Tom's yelling.
6717722,eng,Sami came down here.
3919462,eng,I think I believe them.
6516017,eng,Tom and Mary said it was them who did that.
2540788,eng,Tom sits at his computer all day.
6527942,eng,Tom didn't need to do what Mary suggested.
3595718,eng,The purring cat rubbed up against Tom's leg.
419720,eng,How many kebabs will you have?
7512477,eng,I know Tom isn't used to speaking in public.
6651064,eng,Tom said that he wouldn't try doing that anymore.
6417727,eng,Mary said she wouldn't let it happen again.
5357775,eng,Only you can save me.
2486686,eng,The last time I saw Tom he was headed toward the beach.
49972,eng,The buildings are small in comparison with the skyscrapers in New York.
1885963,eng,Hey. Where are you going?
5859789,eng,I did it on Monday.
1305767,eng,He is young but clever.
2170259,eng,It'd be nice if you could sing.
3439899,eng,I'm not defending Tom.
5726142,eng,We must never let our guard down.
6652057,eng,Tom said that he wants go back to Boston someday.
2538051,eng,Tom put the knife down on the kitchen table.
2262900,eng,What a terrible waste!
6662480,eng,I have no idea where Tom might be now.
6628120,eng,Mary ate a smashed avocado toast.
46800,eng,The young couple surveyed the room.
6439666,eng,Tom isn't my boss anymore.
3724407,eng,People are going to talk.
3428545,eng,Tom got a part-time job as gardener.
249777,eng,It is too warm for me.
2643428,eng,You said you wanted to know.
751245,eng,I consider relationships to be the most important thing in life.
6342454,eng,You aren't expected to be able to do that.
6418340,eng,Mary told me she didn't do anything wrong.
307812,eng,Able was I ere I saw him.
2546851,eng,You're worse than Tom.
5966472,eng,The sky is orange.
6648106,eng,Tom said that he was hoping you could do that with him.
435434,eng,What name will be given to the child?
5215429,eng,"There is an important reason that so many working families feel like the system is rigged, and it’s because the economy hasn’t caught up to some of the enormous changes that have transformed America over the past 50 years. Those days when the average family was a dad who went to work every day and a mom who stayed at home and did all the unpaid labor -- that’s not what our economy looks like anymore. Household and work arrangements come in all shapes and all combinations, and yet, our workplace policies still look like they’re straight out of Mad Men."
7443373,eng,They took off their watches.
6255229,eng,Tom said Mary knew John might not be required to do that.
314504,eng,She had her tooth pulled.
6522897,eng,Tom and Mary lost their balance.
5483275,eng,I couldn't help staring at her.
4950437,eng,Would you mind if I told Tom about this?
265738,eng,Try to read as many books as you can when young.
6716338,eng,I asked if I really needed to do that.
2283767,eng,They probably don't know.
5226349,eng,Tom will write a sentence in German.
282049,eng,A cat can see in the dark.
6262236,eng,Tom said Mary frequently does that by herself.
4256532,eng,"On December 3rd, 1967, Doctor Barnard was able to perform the first human heart transplant."
6327216,eng,Tom likes electronic dance music.
3821860,eng,You're obese.
15805,eng,All that you have to do is to wait for his reply.
7242542,eng,Sami and Layla spent their honeymoon in Egypt.
3300567,eng,Don't you dare talk to me like that.
6872787,eng,I'm not sure yet if I'll go to a university or get a job.
3916585,eng,I've got no secrets from her.
7593131,eng,Turns out that being a fisherman is no easy task.
6670093,eng,Mary wanted to be a writer.
5752476,eng,Nobody went to class.
7112405,eng,I need to get medical attention.
34740,eng,The noise of the heavy traffic kept me awake all night.
323489,eng,The stray girl sobbed her name.
3221348,eng,That sure made me look stupid.
6272836,eng,Tom didn't think Mary was ready.
41120,eng,If you pump air into a tire it expands.
3727040,eng,Shoot anything that moves.
5754220,eng,"When I see him dance, I can't stop laughing."
6890359,eng,"Don't call the pancakes. Call them ""death-cakes"". The carbs!"
7439498,eng,They said they planned to go Monday.
5639754,eng,"When I was young, the hippest thing a kid could own was a transistor radio."
7185926,eng,I'm sorry that I didn't call.
2333751,eng,I don't like the smell of the perfume Mary is wearing today.
6566668,eng,I think you owe me a kiss.
2259687,eng,This belt fits me too tightly.
2543370,eng,Tom knows this is the truth.
4463700,eng,I'll be jealous.
6426737,eng,"Mary is resourceful, isn't she?"
6796744,eng,Who taught Tom how to dance?
6501156,eng,I'm not sure whether Tom and Mary are still asleep or not.
5236080,eng,War leads to intolerance; intolerance leads to war.
4495435,eng,Neither one is acceptable.
6664403,eng,Tom hasn't gone to bed yet.
7391457,eng,She tried to hide her anxiety.
6662919,eng,I don't have a say in that matter.
295204,eng,He enjoys reading novels on holiday.
373330,eng,Hello!
2584125,eng,Tom likes to sing. He would like to study music at university.
6302338,eng,Sami moved to a quiet street.
887325,eng,She persuaded him to do it.
7539901,eng,Neither Tom nor Mary has anything to do with that.
3919443,eng,"You don't believe them, do you?"
281727,eng,The Japanese tend to identify themselves with the group they belong to.
6496787,eng,Tom and Mary took a lot of pictures when they were in Boston.
3147836,eng,A drop of sweat ran down the side of his temple.
3869448,eng,You're the one I need now.
3913731,eng,Where does that leave them?
2244634,eng,Is Tom right?
7218056,eng,Sami forgot to clock in.
3636020,eng,Tom saw an accident on his way to school.
2835967,eng,It was just your imagination.
2319015,eng,The two of you have ruined my life.
268667,eng,"The food wasn't good, but at least it was cheap."
2537450,eng,I was afraid I might not be able to do it correctly.
6407138,eng,"Mary couldn't find a job she liked in Boston, so she moved to Chicago."
1025069,eng,Tom is by far the best singer performing at this club.
6740650,eng,Sami sat back down.
430188,eng,It's easy to cut cheese with a knife.
321258,eng,In the north it is cold in winter.
6431985,eng,Tom thinks that Mary will eat what he makes for her.
4823619,eng,She will drop it this time.
2956887,eng,Tom has been urging me to join the army.
2540111,eng,I'm looking forward to meeting you.
6523928,eng,I wonder whether Tom was able to do that or not.
6199686,eng,"Everything, really everything at Tom's place is connected with cats."
6365393,eng,Sami became more controlling.
1884484,eng,Tom just wants you to take care of his dog.
7407705,eng,They drove their kids to school.
7214471,eng,Tom told me that he was teaching French.
7590702,eng,This is unprecedented.
303528,eng,He dedicated his life to peace.
5667920,eng,I can sleep on the couch.
237932,eng,The notice could not be made out by the students.
2275305,eng,Don't take it so hard.
2950125,eng,I'm not interested in having a boyfriend at this point.
6650093,eng,Tom said that he didn't think that the heat bothered Mary.
3395403,eng,"Hi, is this Mary? ""No, it's Tom. Mary says Hello."""
6386137,eng,Sami knows Layla is angry with him.
2360631,eng,I've told you everything I can think of.
7521019,eng,I know that you're innocent.
39643,eng,Please join the two ends of the tape together.
5733437,eng,Tom was in the passenger seat.
3325250,eng,"Even before the plastic surgery, Mary wasn't unattractive."
6575256,eng,What is up with this?
6497924,eng,Tom and Mary will probably tell John they'll never do that.
6351312,eng,I'd be foolish not to do that.
6245472,eng,Tom said I didn't sound very optimistic.
3177883,eng,Tom slept with his shoes on.
2545007,eng,I need a receipt for that.
7306889,eng,Sami and Layla met a Muslim couple in Toronto.
7507677,eng,Tom told Mary that he needed more time to do that.
5024663,eng,Tom says the same thing.
6247737,eng,I'm glad that Tom didn't do that.
6243785,eng,That's the reason Tom went to Boston.
2803608,eng,"Being a soldier is my job, where I have authority over bombs."
7475690,eng,They left their hats in my room.
2646939,eng,Tom isn't really old.
6717172,eng,Sami was led out of the courtroom in handcuffs.
2505867,eng,I straighten my hair every day.
7541305,eng,Tom and Mary noticed John at the same time.
2300568,eng,I can assure you everything is under control.
7398017,eng,She admitted that she was nervous.
4111379,eng,Mary barely touched her food.
7114105,eng,I give to charities.
318521,eng,You should not look down upon the poor.
3608723,eng,Three bears lived in that little house.
7731674,eng,Tom didn't seem very interested in doing that.
2408501,eng,I think we're going to need more time.
7226323,eng,"Personally, I don't think that Tom has a chance of winning."
6514765,eng,Let's hope Tom and Mary do that for us.
3112312,eng,Tom wondered what was going on.
6525285,eng,Tom and Mary both have new bicycles.
6342215,eng,I want to deposit this check in my account.
7396815,eng,He told me that he didn't agree.
3726531,eng,Tom was a soldier's soldier.
328683,eng,I moved a chess piece on the board one forward.
7512916,eng,Tom and Mary have both decided not to stay.
6518161,eng,Tom and Mary hoped they'd be able to win.
456431,eng,My last name is Jones.
2474833,eng,Have you forgotten?
5237078,eng,These cookies are absolutely delicious.
462396,eng,She threw her hands up in horror when she saw what he had done.
2545242,eng,They were somewhere else.
6435755,eng,I was hoping Tom would do that for us.
7258380,eng,Sami really needs to go home.
2647570,eng,Tom and I were busy.
7443597,eng,Tom and Mary told me that they were going to win.
7379707,eng,Mary is off doing her own thing.
6440529,eng,It's going to heal.
5047477,eng,Don't forget to follow us on Twitter and Facebook for updates and info on new releases.
6123693,eng,Tom chose the wrong path.
3168263,eng,Have you seen one?
5757936,eng,I think that's it.
2712849,eng,I'm glad I didn't buy one of those.
252031,eng,"I have a friend whose nickname is ""Pencil."""
4377679,eng,"Most utensils, such as can openers and scissors, are made for right-handers."
2261179,eng,Can we save Tom?
5851704,eng,I may still do that.
1938888,eng,I thought Tom had gotten over Mary.
6415913,eng,Mary would do that if she had a lot of money.
6426469,eng,Mary sold everything she owned.
6425224,eng,Mary says she'll be busy tonight.
953174,eng,Did you double-check these figures?
1699279,eng,We can do it right now.
7317381,eng,Sami left home.
3374743,eng,I lost my job.
5916316,eng,Tom told me that I should retire.
4008813,eng,Dan knows very well how to deal with psychological warfare.
2756943,eng,You are responsible.
1624859,eng,Go out and look at the blue skies.
6479697,eng,My mom gave me RM100 to buy necessities.
1720956,eng,But how does this story end?
6478007,eng,That's my mom's idea!
3200740,eng,Tell Tom to stay where he is.
2359525,eng,I haven't found it yet.
3734525,eng,"You really should keep your promises, Tom."
265715,eng,It is important to find true friends when you are young.
7172379,eng,I thought that there was a good chance Tom wouldn't want to go with us.
2046651,eng,I was busy.
2698873,eng,He comes here twice a week.
1030189,eng,Tom showed Mary a picture of John.
5677111,eng,Tom wrote his Christmas list.
7731790,eng,Tom is probably a little younger than I am.
6325973,eng,It was really embarassing.
6661833,eng,I can't put up with Tom's carelessness any longer.
6476445,eng,Sami drank a lot.
1691831,eng,You're reliable.
3428336,eng,Tom wasn't hard to find.
6522773,eng,Tom and Mary cleaned their rooms.
4425703,eng,He drained his glass in one gulp.
3270994,eng,You should darken the colours a little.
5179967,eng,Amsterdam is the capital of the Netherlands.
1466049,eng,"Maybe in a different universe, the emotional and psychic environment is even different from ours."
2028407,eng,"So, what did you want to talk to me about?"
6522645,eng,Tom and Mary say they won't stay.
6353392,eng,Tom told me you left early.
3259067,eng,They are going to get married in the town hall.
6650489,eng,Tom said that his father used to be a truck driver.
5639975,eng,Rhinos are killed by poachers for their horns.
3347134,eng,You need to walk away.
995337,eng,Old cows eat tender grass.
6912636,eng,Tom and Mary are back home.
5916281,eng,You've made three errors.
2119615,eng,Who would better his state should look to his foundations.
7471919,eng,Tom and Mary do that every chance they get.
3994484,eng,My friend always jokes when I am not in the right mood.
1306715,eng,I'm an old man.
3728142,eng,I booked us an earlier flight.
953793,eng,I'll be there as soon as I can.
22589,eng,We never meet without parting.
5851884,eng,I won't listen to you anymore.
6432721,eng,Tom asked me who walked home with me last night.
6048873,eng,Why are you trying to do that?
5639193,eng,"No, I'm not going to take it back."
3197483,eng,I think I should tell Tom where I've been.
2763458,eng,Don't make me do that.
3619798,eng,Tom asked me if he could close the windows.
6351950,eng,Why does that make you angry?
2546069,eng,I'll handle things here.
2988677,eng,What's the title of the movie?
6947986,eng,The dog took off after a squirrel and yanked hard on the leash.
6414848,eng,"Mary is afraid to go out after dark, isn't she?"
6139213,eng,Tom hasn't eaten at home in a long time.
6504572,eng,I'll make sure Tom and Mary have everything they need.
6356586,eng,This town isn't large.
6094628,eng,Layla felt bad about that.
7396960,eng,He says he's good at doing that.
24497,eng,Thousands of people were there.
1555172,eng,Where did you go for vacation?
6502169,eng,It looks like Tom and Mary have no idea how to do that.
4348268,eng,Take this medicine. You'll soon feel better.
2643039,eng,I thought Tom would be hungry.
6335531,eng,Tom and Mary are planning on staying until Monday.
6259906,eng,Tom said Mary was glad that you did that for him.
7231114,eng,I don't think that Tom wants to leave today.
7389072,eng,He's on his way back to the office.
6231307,eng,Why haven't you helped Tom like you said you would?
268138,eng,He called up his uncle as soon as he got to Matsuyama.
2956559,eng,Tom didn't reply to any of Mary's letter.
6417262,eng,Mary didn't help us like she said she would.
680664,eng,The man denied that he took the money.
2725867,eng,"How can it be that mathematics, being after all a product of human thought which is independent of experience, is so admirably appropriate to the objects of reality? Is human reason, then, without experience, merely by taking thought, able to fathom the properties of real things."
6353673,eng,It looks like you're angry.
7167980,eng,I knew you wouldn't have to stay in Boston for as long as you thought you'd have to stay.
2821448,eng,Tom can't be reasoned with.
2359308,eng,I've been very patient with you.
7150378,eng,Was Tom in Australia last year?
245118,eng,Mr Yamada was kind enough to drive me home.
3937301,eng,"I am hungry, have not had food since the morning."
3649322,eng,She was busy.
6303474,eng,I'm worried about the weather.
245369,eng,"The job is interesting, but not always easy."
7135443,eng,The first order of business is to evaluate how to prevent people from driving while intoxicated.
7170249,eng,I think that Tom will be able to help Mary.
2111332,eng,They're babies.
5473699,eng,That isn't my fault.
7517870,eng,I know Tom isn't a very good dancer.
255932,eng,I have never heard Roy sing a song in public.
5383117,eng,Order now.
6427417,eng,Mary asked Tom join her group.
3619401,eng,I don't know what else I can do.
3910493,eng,Nobody saw me do it.
7474178,eng,They put their fingers to their lips.
7117482,eng,Tom asked Mary to kill John.
287549,eng,His book is famous not only in England but also in Japan.
7512494,eng,I know Tom is almost always here on Mondays.
280535,eng,I'm trying to find a green sweater in extra large.
7189513,eng,What do you usually do when you get sick?
2952933,eng,"If someone's in trouble, you should help them."
17125,eng,What do you do?
6175564,eng,Everyone worked according to one's capacity.
7488597,eng,Where did she find my keys?
3272166,eng,They don't sell phone credit.
7320065,eng,I'll make us some tea.
3860098,eng,They devised ingenious solutions.
6338405,eng,I was surprised that Tom didn't know how to swim.
2013090,eng,Why do you want to meet Tom?
3075182,eng,They swim very quickly.
24967,eng,Help yourself to anything you like.
3203798,eng,Did you tell Tom I was going to Boston?
4889889,eng,I don't have any regrets.
5649324,eng,I'm pretty sure Tom was the person who did that.
2062892,eng,Something unusual happened last night.
5184511,eng,"If it weren't for modern medicine, I'd be dead right now."
3584869,eng,This parrot has green feathers.
2832551,eng,She revealed the secret.
2016676,eng,I wanted you to have a little fun.
2487271,eng,Now I know that you're a man who has feelings.
7736800,eng,"Tom's house is small, but it's big enough for him."
3722231,eng,Tom clearly has something to hide.
7444569,eng,They told me that they'd done that.
7275577,eng,Sami reached over and grabbed Layla's hand.
262087,eng,I play the guitar before dinner.
6740511,eng,I wasn't very motivated to do that.
240186,eng,The sale will be over in two days.
7315244,eng,"The egg is covered with shell, under which is the white and within this the egg yolk."
3257186,eng,Tom wanted to learn how to defend himself.
7385394,eng,He knows who killed his dog.
3172178,eng,Go and tell Tom.
7383798,eng,She's still where we left her.
2474671,eng,I bet that would look great on me.
244407,eng,Yesterday a truck hit this wall.
7176003,eng,Tom thinks that that's ridiculous.
4079376,eng,The girl is writing.
6224899,eng,Tom might not know where Mary went to school.
22848,eng,We have to distinguish right from wrong.
5636506,eng,Tom can't speak French well.
1886734,eng,What happened the other night?
5445708,eng,It will all be over soon.
60436,eng,This is because they are trying to prove they are somewhat independent.
306925,eng,They thanked God.
3738917,eng,Do you know why Tom doesn't like Mary?
1028445,eng,Tom just can't seem to get along with Mary.
775614,eng,The queue for buying tickets was unbelievably long.
6342398,eng,Tom couldn't go fishing with us last summer.
7177173,eng,Tom said that Mary would very likely do that.
7734907,eng,"You didn't do that by yourselves, did you?"
3826032,eng,Tom always eats fruit for breakfast.
2471839,eng,Tom glanced away from her.
7114287,eng,I scrunched down.
6410277,eng,You should probably tell Mary that she has to do that.
427977,eng,"The Caped Crusader is friends with Robin, the boy Wonder."
7213560,eng,Sami is having his break.
6652282,eng,Tom said that he tried very hard to win.
6243809,eng,Please listen to what Tom has to say.
4600543,eng,"Take an axe, and cut off the head of the calf with one blow. With a second, split its head in two, and in its brain you will see a bright red ball. Bring that to me."
262921,eng,We should provide against fires.
6255003,eng,I'd stay in Boston if I were you.
65442,eng,"Shut up and listen, kid."
1951358,eng,I can't blame you for what I've done.
5726201,eng,The zombies attacked the joggers.
4664468,eng,There's little cause for optimism.
7376120,eng,Mary told me she would go to Boston.
2546790,eng,I was having a bad day.
4500130,eng,I should be fine.
317974,eng,Small hills look flat from an airplane.
6372681,eng,Sami has ended this affair months ago.
6499717,eng,We really thought Tom and Mary were going to stay for a few days.
2877252,eng,"On a neighbor's horse, the burden isn't heavy."
7444919,eng,They told me that they'd wait.
275253,eng,I'm losing weight.
6575401,eng,He's bashful.
1948893,eng,We all know it.
7378046,eng,Mary said that she knew the rules.
6408551,eng,"You didn't know Mary wanted to do that by herself, did you?"
482361,eng,I don't believe it!
272534,eng,Snow covered the bus.
5195232,eng,Can you tell me how to get to the library?
7514980,eng,I want you to know that Tom is doing OK.
6900894,eng,My wife is six months pregnant with our first son.
5197911,eng,Open the cupboard on the left. The bottles are there.
7520084,eng,Tom caught more fish than Mary.
6713316,eng,How long will it take me to get to the airport from here?
3544434,eng,He's a good bloke.
292483,eng,He drank that large beer mug dry.
7194194,eng,I didn't tell Tom I grew up in Australia.
2485114,eng,She has a crush on Justin Timberlake.
3123466,eng,I didn't like Tom at all.
328296,eng,Good timing. I'll get you to test drive the new model.
3917885,eng,We have to go back for her.
7089789,eng,The government considers every failure a success.
5235326,eng,The bedraggled houses were finally destroyed by the platoon.
6673333,eng,Sami has hurt Layla before.
3920922,eng,I remember hearing about him.
2645676,eng,We'll know soon enough.
7476900,eng,There was blood on the carpet.
16201,eng,You can get a loan from a bank.
5937391,eng,I'd forgotten how much I like Tom.
4502367,eng,Tom took over his father's store.
7543700,eng,Tom doesn't need three bicycles.
6531581,eng,Tom is working hard on it.
6273270,eng,I thought Tom didn't know Mary.
7403730,eng,He said he liked the idea.
6515820,eng,It looks like Tom and Mary are afraid.
2570974,eng,Toast!
3205138,eng,The only one who can tell us what we need to know is Tom.
6506305,eng,Tom and Mary said they'd be in a meeting until 2:30.
6517556,eng,Tom and Mary wanted to live on their own.
7337299,eng,"The doctor smiled, and qualified his advice."
243731,eng,I am into golf lately.
4133482,eng,I don't eat oysters.
6274541,eng,You were annoying.
323112,eng,I'll answer you tomorrow.
6245945,eng,I thought Tom would be sympathetic.
6716518,eng,I'm not sure that's something I want to do.
3737969,eng,"We're not really going to buy all these people steak dinners, are we?"
2372803,eng,I just need a little air.
6577080,eng,It will take awhile.
7298330,eng,I'm just as busy as Tom.
7540890,eng,Why do you think Tom wanted Mary to do that?
4962881,eng,No one else was hurt.
414356,eng,"When the farmer drops dead off the tractor, then at the edge of the forest, there must be a reactor."
6419206,eng,Mary said that she won't do that anymore.
6338139,eng,I didn't think you were going to be able to convince Tom to do that.
5452692,eng,Tom didn't get on the train.
6091945,eng,Do you know whose handwriting it is?
6494307,eng,"If Tom and Mary do what we asked them to do, there'll be no problem."
6519441,eng,Tom and Mary told me they'd try to win.
2720758,eng,"What do you need a baby for? It just eats, shits, vomits, and cries."
4009621,eng,An intruder entered Dan's room.
3908253,eng,Did you tell her that?
5276140,eng,I'd have a problem with that.
3736242,eng,I didn't plan on doing that.
6547190,eng,Tom and I are pretty proud of ourselves.
3733674,eng,Tom knows better than to go out after dark by himself.
7361079,eng,Sami and Layla are very conscious of this.
6076537,eng,Tell me precisely why you think so.
3386109,eng,I need to go milk the cows.
1407598,eng,It took us two hours to get to Athens.
6780435,eng,He hasn't got much upstairs.
25997,eng,I rode with her as far as the station.
6262068,eng,Tom said he's glad Mary has finally graduated.
5741034,eng,This show is taped in front of a live audience.
5835983,eng,Go back in there.
467966,eng,You seem to have mistaken me for my older brother.
7164511,eng,Tom has to be in Australia next Monday.
6514771,eng,It's not as easy as Tom and Mary think.
3736486,eng,Tom says I have to babysit tonight.
7508413,eng,It was clear Tom was already finished doing that.
3415183,eng,Tom says he'll do his best to finish the job before next Monday.
2092549,eng,Is anybody ready for dessert?
41382,eng,There is no excuse for such behavior.
6351767,eng,Do you really want to eat now?
1094447,eng,Tom doesn't know the half of it.
7010757,eng,Tom isn't likely to go to Boston with Mary.
4024343,eng,Mary had an ultrasound to find out the sex of her and Tom's unborn baby.
6294005,eng,"Callisto, the outermost of the four Galilean moons, has an old surface that is perhaps the most heavily cratered of any object in the solar system."
260907,eng,"When I called him right-wing, I mean that his thinking is old-fashioned."
1883078,eng,The surgeon removed the wrong organ.
6690982,eng,Sami drove to Cairo to deliver drugs.
3100623,eng,I walk to the house.
6514909,eng,I thought Tom and Mary were unbeatable.
3813120,eng,We have more in common than can be seen at first sight.
2767300,eng,We living are all dead who haven't assumed their office yet.
2847667,eng,I don't manufacture your computers.
5826394,eng,I forgot to tell Tom to take the cookies out of the oven.
247743,eng,We stayed with them all through the summer.
696831,eng,How can things be perfect?
6083851,eng,You should tell Tom that Mary isn't likely to do that.
6492092,eng,I didn't know if Tom and Mary were busy or not.
5757535,eng,Tom loved the work.
4546349,eng,Let me sing a song for you.
44745,eng,The airfield on the island is now covered with weeds.
6343128,eng,What was Tom's motive for doing that?
289168,eng,He always tries to trip people up.
2642043,eng,Tom was the one that had the key.
6495238,eng,Tom and Mary didn't know whether they should believe John or not.
2358739,eng,I have a job to finish.
3148323,eng,Tom is now attending a conference in Boston.
2440106,eng,"Pass me the broom and dustpan, please. I spilled some crumbs on the floor."
3764633,eng,Subject numerals in Arabic language is quite difficult.
6514257,eng,Do you think Tom and Mary use hairspray?
1365853,eng,They're a dime a dozen.
1690455,eng,They used a high-speed camera.
3049844,eng,Whoever reads this so-called newspaper every day will inevitably go daft.
7378821,eng,Mary said she'll visit Australia.
6685341,eng,I'm probably not the only one that needs to do that.
7217471,eng,I'm afraid that I can't help you.
3721346,eng,Tom is going to have your job.
5725631,eng,Numerous other lawsuits are pending.
5259230,eng,I thought I could get more.
2406364,eng,I should stay away from here.
7117545,eng,Tom is a convicted arsonist.
7375012,eng,Mary is convinced everybody hates her.
6414140,eng,Mary said she I thought I should do that myself.
3129775,eng,I don't want it to happen.
329507,eng,"I was lonely, with nobody to play with."
3409654,eng,Every sentence present in Tatoeba is a lie.
5786061,eng,"Today is a ""the morning"", that you have been looking forward to."
6347765,eng,Tom wasn't in Boston last weekend.
907362,eng,The Collosseum is the very icon of Rome.
2011873,eng,I don't want to see you.
5747365,eng,Last night was amazing.
6258359,eng,My friends did that without me.
7378636,eng,Mary was able to extend her visa.
3152725,eng,Let me give you another example.
301700,eng,He's an absolute fool.
1027506,eng,I think Tom doesn't have the ability to solve the problem.
7156752,eng,I'm sure I'll eventually go to Australia. I just don't know when.
7457705,eng,Why did she open that door?
2249274,eng,It's so sad.
6604312,eng,Speak up if you notice other viewers behaving in a way that disturbs wildlife.
3616260,eng,The first casualty of every war is the truth.
805253,eng,Many Americans opposed the treaty.
3193979,eng,My child would never do that.
6123709,eng,Tom has become a teacher.
6237325,eng,I didn't tell Tom what I was supposed to do.
3917534,eng,They'll be looking for her.
7288504,eng,He didn't seduce her. She seduced him.
262990,eng,We hid behind a bush so that no one would see us.
254135,eng,I was scared at the mere thought of it.
4665954,eng,Tom does look really tired.
6225347,eng,Tom didn't think anyone would want to do that.
4015564,eng,Are you sure Tom didn't have any help?
5735895,eng,Tom fed his hostage junk food.
2249143,eng,It's obviously broken.
5940128,eng,Tom would classify it as a great book.
3916629,eng,This is from us.
7515174,eng,I know that Tom is a fairly good skater.
6454879,eng,Sami and Layla have always been there for each other.
1548244,eng,It looks great so far.
24882,eng,How wonderful a time we have had!
327606,eng,"The reduction in obstetricians and gynecologists is a reflection of the decrease in births, thus reducing need for medical care."
2546296,eng,We have an appointment.
23701,eng,The flowers in the vase are roses.
4486275,eng,The chance of rain is low.
6508900,eng,Tom and Mary cleaned the garage all by themselves.
7035385,eng,She's a sweet teacher.
3348435,eng,You're going to prison.
6254700,eng,My wife's waiting for me at home.
2015964,eng,I dunno what's with ya these days.
3821797,eng,Tom felt that he was getting old.
3678262,eng,Are you Tom's mother?
7473474,eng,They say they're going to stop smoking.
4030375,eng,It turns out that you are unexpectedly eloquent.
5790361,eng,Please buy me a beer.
2679192,eng,Shut up! We'll miss the best part.
36198,eng,Nancy is stressed out.
300145,eng,He liberated the people from bondage.
7387150,eng,He cared for his sick father.
1029065,eng,Tom doesn't let Mary watch TV after 10:00 p.m.
6676655,eng,I suspected that Tom was the one who did that.
7114163,eng,Who was Tom scolded by?
6501177,eng,Tom and Mary said they didn't want to talk about school.
3555139,eng,Let's play football today.
4088061,eng,The angry crowd clambered around the police van shouting insults at the suspected paedophile inside it.
5858762,eng,I lifted the box.
5895482,eng,The two of them carried Fadil's body.
6843064,eng,Step 1: Be attractive.
803194,eng,He was a fresh face in American politics.
7401604,eng,She told me that she was done.
6431004,eng,I don't speak French as well as I'd like to.
953806,eng,I'll pay you back as soon as I can.
7392915,eng,He said that he had to leave early.
954563,eng,What kind of person would treat their pet that way?
3120601,eng,Martin is as tall as Francesca.
3908376,eng,Do you want to tell him?
6337427,eng,I didn't think Tom did that well.
1912053,eng,He dressed like a girl.
7149853,eng,Tom won't come to Australia until next week.
1025056,eng,Tom is drawing a picture of a small boy and his dog.
1527795,eng,"Takashi said he wasn't afraid of ghosts, but when he heard some sounds from the supposedly empty second floor, he quickly scrambled away."
7440791,eng,They said they were serious.
2013007,eng,I want you to come home now.
3597450,eng,You look exactly like Tom.
4238242,eng,Tom wanted to impress his friends.
1474112,eng,I can't understand why they're such good friends. They have hardly anything in common.
953097,eng,Are you afraid of the dark?
6654802,eng,Tom said that he didn't know when Mary was planning to go to Boston.
5350241,eng,Tom is very generous with his friends.
4629801,eng,Tom was taken into custody.
321613,eng,I have decided to carry on the work.
492575,eng,"I don't understand what it is that you're trying to say, but I like it!"
7436756,eng,Tom and Mary said that they thought I was funny.
4495639,eng,No answer was given.
3282482,eng,You followed.
4275671,eng,You know I hate it.
6244655,eng,Tom and I've known each other since 2013.
5076261,eng,Will it make a difference?
58053,eng,"The last time I went to China, I visited Shanghai."
6273905,eng,Let's do that first.
7399079,eng,"He isn't very efficient, is he?"
23333,eng,Our friendship did not last.
6786279,eng,I know you've helped us.
300653,eng,He will present a book to his teacher.
2098924,eng,"Hi, I'm the King of the Universe."
4499939,eng,I can always improve.
3904807,eng,I want him brought here now.
7402710,eng,He told me he didn't do it.
5685600,eng,"There's a girl—one of my friends, she says she is—who is always trying to imitate me."
308777,eng,She has very few close friends.
7129944,eng,Tom doesn't seem to be as fearless as Mary seems to be.
2647366,eng,Was the door closed?
7474093,eng,They say they want their things back.
6222351,eng,Tom said that it was an exciting game.
2713711,eng,What's our problem?
2459479,eng,I'm afraid of bats.
6529807,eng,I'm getting paid a lot to do this.
5401661,eng,Who broke the plate?
5222194,eng,I usually eat breakfast here.
245727,eng,"When the boys go camping, they enjoy living in a primitive way."
6251342,eng,I won't do that unless you help me.
5331042,eng,You didn't feel dizzy.
6267445,eng,Tom didn't tell Mary what he has to buy.
6416446,eng,Mary has been doing that since she was a kid.
6702132,eng,You must go there immediately.
6472961,eng,Sami discovered the truth about Layla's temperament too late.
3920784,eng,I have news about her.
4662854,eng,Be careful not to drink too much coffee in the evening.
6126628,eng,When is Tom planning to do that?
873841,eng,What are your thoughts on the company?
6491895,eng,I know Tom and Mary say they don't like me.
2639829,eng,Tom and Mary sat on a park bench and talked for hours.
60779,eng,This dress fits you well.
7131141,eng,Tom served three years in the Navy.
254502,eng,I felt sorry for the boy.
240484,eng,"To do him justice, we must say that he is a minor musician."
1923405,eng,We heard gunshots from next door.
1013826,eng,We're even.
2718150,eng,We went for our walk and held hands.
7230265,eng,I don't think that Tom knows where Mary wants to go next weekend.
6236268,eng,I think Tom could be just the person we need.
7214335,eng,Tom told me that he wanted to leave.
264455,eng,Japanese people are fortunate to live in a land with natural hot springs.
7278366,eng,Sami made so many mistakes.
5184881,eng,I won't miss Tom at all.
3826784,eng,I was the one that was right all along.
5825014,eng,"In the garden below were lilac-trees purple with flowers, and their dizzily sweet fragrance drifted up to the window on the morning wind."
259333,eng,I am satisfied with my life in college to a certain extent.
2758867,eng,Do you mind telling me what's happening?
7542202,eng,Tom is one of my sister's best friends.
6077828,eng,Tom is going for broke.
18338,eng,The brightness of the sky showed that the storm had passed.
3157594,eng,I don't watch the TV in the afternoon.
6947022,eng,I walked to the window and looked out.
3728520,eng,That's very elegant.
3597669,eng,How are you coming along with your French lessons?
7735041,eng,Tom told me to call 911.
5974660,eng,Her playing is full of wrong notes.
1868346,eng,Tom doesn't live here.
7440863,eng,They said they may do that.
3402442,eng,What use would this be to you?
6652020,eng,Tom said that he was afraid of heights.
21308,eng,"It's been nice talking to you, but I really must go now."
291819,eng,He reached across the table and shook my hand.
7171546,eng,I thought that you might like to know.
7286202,eng,Sami didn't see Layla's phone.
2858999,eng,Mary loves art.
6241921,eng,I should've known better than to do that.
2641400,eng,What part of Australia are you from?
6666131,eng,Tom and I should be the ones who do that.
4497334,eng,This is so disappointing.
6652666,eng,Tom said he thought that Mary looked discouraged.
6658993,eng,I don't go to Boston as much as I used to.
285254,eng,What he said is still dark.
6956364,eng,This fast food restaurant creates a lot of waste.
6340322,eng,I wonder if we'll ever figure out how to do that.
4661535,eng,It's been a week now since Tom changed his underpants.
3199865,eng,Did I tell you that?
5274745,eng,Tom wouldn't let that happen.
56423,eng,A campaign is underway throughout the company to achieve economy in the use of copying paper.
457741,eng,I trust you.
2540248,eng,I told Tom that wasn't a good idea.
1454365,eng,You don't need to go there.
7506851,eng,I knew that Tom knew when Mary was going to do that.
6346877,eng,Tom didn't seem to be concentrating.
2955823,eng,Tom and Mary realized that they weren't really compatible.
2822951,eng,Do you feel like answering to my question?
2327446,eng,The explorers finally reached their goal.
3915511,eng,I heard her sobbing.
1093470,eng,Tom is in the kitchen making tea.
7549017,eng,Would you please speak a little quieter?
5833801,eng,I'm so impatient to see her.
5744797,eng,Do you like Tom for a name?
7528187,eng,You're living in a dream world.
6956349,eng,This tastes horrible.
5747835,eng,You have no influence.
7168463,eng,I think that Tom is athletic.
7493885,eng,Where did Tom buy this tennis racket?
3163289,eng,How in the world did you find me?
2272726,eng,Tom has gone insane.
5883060,eng,Fadil's infirmity didn't slow him down.
1075848,eng,Would you like some popcorn?
1165461,eng,I went to the supermarket.
2796611,eng,Please tell me where I can park my car.
2361695,eng,I should get packed.
48126,eng,I don't know how deep the lake is.
1572861,eng,Do you think that we'll find her house?
2396201,eng,I've heard this story before.
2239662,eng,She didn't think it was funny.
2833880,eng,There is no prescription for a common cold.
7178157,eng,Tom said that Mary shouldn't have bought what she bought.
7171117,eng,I thought that you said you couldn't afford a truck.
6504745,eng,"No matter what I do, Tom and Mary always complain."
6262160,eng,My suitcase isn't very heavy.
2271971,eng,I won't kill you.
16018,eng,You cannot be too careful when driving.
7208697,eng,Sami is gonna be with Layla.
5758399,eng,Who lost face?
6424581,eng,Mary says she hopes Tom does that.
277035,eng,Knowledge is not an end in itself.
7516418,eng,I think that Tom is alone in his room.
7243898,eng,Sami helped Layla move.
3573987,eng,I wasn't the one who broke the window.
71768,eng,"To get technical information from that company, we first have to sign a non-disclosure agreement."
3721431,eng,Tom is lying face down on the bed.
260987,eng,I made him go.
6425904,eng,Mary should tell Tom she's busy.
7474305,eng,They didn't know when they'd be back.
6211249,eng,Shy people avoid eye contact and blush easily.
72275,eng,There is no bus service after nine-thirty.
1578569,eng,There is nothing more important than friends.
3819938,eng,How large were they?
7633281,eng,"Tom, where did you go in Australia?"
7509082,eng,Take off your coats and make yourselves at home.
805262,eng,Americans simply had no desire to fight.
3448712,eng,I saw Tom go into the store across the street.
246491,eng,Hang on till I get to you.
4496492,eng,That'll change now.
309090,eng,Her speech moved the audience.
1650566,eng,Don't leave any computer in the meeting room.
7390800,eng,He removed his goggles.
3824062,eng,I'm sorry that I couldn't do anything to help.
6226298,eng,Tom must've thought Mary already knew how to do that.
4844603,eng,"Bro, what's your family name?"
6261922,eng,Tom doesn't know that I'm hungry.
6157109,eng,We worked like ants.
2387210,eng,I might be back by 2:30.
885394,eng,I'm not a magician.
1682964,eng,I'm outraged!
7174844,eng,Tom thought that he might not be allowed to do that.
7376419,eng,Mary needs surgery on her left foot.
6413022,eng,I thought Mary would have all the time she needed.
4523306,eng,"Sooner or later, someone is going to have to tell Tom that he needs to behave himself."
6891031,eng,"I tried to persuade Tom, but I couldn't."
3732991,eng,That doesn't trouble me.
7539404,eng,Neither Tom nor Mary has a lot of things to deal with.
7541955,eng,Tom helps Mary whenever she asks him to.
2329593,eng,I got a B in arithmetic.
6114020,eng,"I think Tom is doing that, too."
2045769,eng,Isn't it a beautiful day?
7113035,eng,I'm sure Tom will be intoxicated.
7132313,eng,Tom has an aunt named Mary.
435394,eng,How can you avoid the dangers of the Internet?
4538715,eng,I get paid tomorrow.
6807033,eng,Sami was freaked out.
6529120,eng,Tom said he didn't plan to be there.
6236366,eng,I don't like riding my motorcycle in the rain.
914077,eng,We had better not mention it.
3921472,eng,Tom will do anything we want him to do.
6257477,eng,I didn't think I had to do that.
2897779,eng,Anything may happen till that time.
6802821,eng,How did you know that Tom was going to do that?
6718100,eng,Do you have to help Tom?
5858571,eng,Tom has gotten fatter.
7229447,eng,Layla was already smashing dudes when she was twelve.
3731382,eng,Never trust a naked woman.
2994202,eng,Tom is not jealous.
2647815,eng,What do you advise?
1434704,eng,"I am very tired, but well."
1096121,eng,"No matter what Tom wears, he always looks great."
6240343,eng,I'm not likely go to Boston until October.
276088,eng,The valley was starred with yellow flowers.
3908551,eng,Are you going to tell them?
2374790,eng,I knew it would be like this.
3726912,eng,Tom likes what he sees.
6416737,eng,Mary told me why she wasn't able to do that.
7229127,eng,I don't think that Tom ought to do that alone.
6516575,eng,Tom and Mary told me they weren't injured.
5360713,eng,I've been in Boston for three years now.
6422982,eng,Mary told me that she's unconvinced.
5358248,eng,I lied to protect you.
264635,eng,I have my own stereo set.
69634,eng,You should be more careful at a crosswalk.
1885921,eng,How did you know my name?
273172,eng,The man swimming in the river is my friend.
6717972,eng,Sami's daughter was a lovely gentle person.
2709143,eng,Is your English getting better?
5798807,eng,Tom's first job was as an usher at movie theater.
1841641,eng,I'll help you pack.
66235,eng,"Once you are married, you are done for."
7735702,eng,Tom used to work there.
3428403,eng,You haven't touched your food.
3415140,eng,Tom met Mary this morning.
2737517,eng,We went to Korea by plane.
1908953,eng,Have you told Tom?
6089328,eng,You are not allowed to ride your bike on the sidewalk.
6424082,eng,Mary looks like she's ready to cry.
3761394,eng,It's not possible to legislate against stupidity.
560357,eng,Vandals wreaked havoc in the abandoned house.
7266197,eng,Sami made more videos.
6089204,eng,Tom thought Mary wouldn't likely do that.
2327073,eng,She gave him a sensuous smile.
6909928,eng,Tom said he'd go there tomorrow.
2510769,eng,I became intrigued.
3536221,eng,"Pardon me, where is the entrance to the dragon's cave? ""You don't want to go there."""
456627,eng,Please speak more slowly.
5848673,eng,Tom is a simple-minded person.
6338556,eng,I'm not the only one who knows where Tom hides his money.
7421665,eng,God answered Tom's prayers.
1025932,eng,Tom doesn't understand this.
5891304,eng,People are not rational.
6522250,eng,Tom and Mary are trying their best.
7381584,eng,Mary ran to get her camera.
6593243,eng,Sami didn't take his eyes off Layla.
2359297,eng,I've been up all night studying.
6666890,eng,I don't think Tom is back.
2619275,eng,"On my way home, I was very scared."
7676163,eng,"Please keep in mind that the proper tag to add to incorrect sentences is ""@change"" and not ""change"". Only with the right tag corpus maintainers will be informed."
314540,eng,She sometimes takes a walk in the park.
5641726,eng,I hope you'll be comfortable.
7438447,eng,They said that they liked speaking French.
6648281,eng,Tom said that he thought that Mary would be through doing that by 2:30.
7278227,eng,Sami is not a quitter.
3421946,eng,We should decide today.
7505094,eng,I know that Tom won't have a difficult time doing that.
714950,eng,Don't you want to come along?
7512191,eng,I wonder whether or not Tom knows that Mary.
6495514,eng,Tom and Mary said they don't understand why you want to do that.
1815331,eng,"Jerusalem is called ""Yerushalayim"" in Hebrew."
7377424,eng,"Mary is waiting outside, isn't she?"
1912004,eng,I had little choice.
6502192,eng,Tom and Mary thought they heard a mouse in the kitchen.
2402183,eng,What tennis players do you like?
5752088,eng,Tom had the last laugh.
7472898,eng,They said that everybody they know can swim.
5373138,eng,I think she's looking at me.
1358409,eng,I met Bob and Mary while I was waiting for Kate.
4225093,eng,Wine is made from grape juice.
7437107,eng,Tom and Mary said they were very hungry.
7396068,eng,She said she wanted to talk to you.
328278,eng,"They also teach that, for great sins, they cannot receive forgiveness unless they confess to their leader."
6230373,eng,Tom didn't seem to understand why he was supposed to do that.
7232261,eng,I don't think that Tom knows how good a dancer Mary is.
6376548,eng,This product is still so new here.
3259324,eng,She has Cupid lips.
1690115,eng,"He's young, naive and inexperienced."
7294432,eng,Sami rested and he is good as new.
6274862,eng,Tom was organized.
4870318,eng,Tom was the one who designed these costumes.
6084368,eng,Anyone who believes that what is written in a holy book is true even if the evidence is against it is dangerous. Christianity used to be the most dangerous religion. Now Islam is.
2631933,eng,This coat doesn't have pockets.
6652581,eng,Tom said he thought that Mary probably wouldn't win.
3594755,eng,I want this fixed as soon as possible.
244334,eng,Did you work yesterday?
6230445,eng,Tom told me that he doesn't think it's necessary to do that.
6268995,eng,Tom didn't think Mary was cooperative.
404121,eng,You told her that you had finished the work three days ago.
7182514,eng,Tom said he knew that was what Mary thought she should do.
6502621,eng,Tom and Mary said they didn't know anything about John.
3819846,eng,I have to stop doing this.
7540689,eng,Tom wasn't sure he had enough money with him.
2033938,eng,There's something else I want to discuss with you.
5254699,eng,I like the color of this shirt.
6896469,eng,"Tom is likely be busy tomorrow, isn't he?"
7227450,eng,I don't think that Tom has done that before.
7134488,eng,There are a lot of things I'm going to do.
1745681,eng,She has no remorse.
6653571,eng,Tom said that he just didn't have the time.
570180,eng,Do your homework now.
1004255,eng,I am more handsome than you.
7121171,eng,Sami gave Layla his hand.
7170010,eng,I think that Tom won't be doing that before Monday.
3201187,eng,"So, what else did Tom tell you?"
32976,eng,"Thanks, Mike. I don't like chicken."
6696284,eng,Sami put a sheet over his wife's body.
5193498,eng,What percent will you discount the prices?
1895710,eng,You may go now.
45721,eng,The washing machine is out of order.
6123883,eng,Tom was the one who told Mary where John lived.
2718432,eng,Tom got his nipples pierced.
7474910,eng,They did what we wanted them to do.
2563243,eng,I have no clue.
6221791,eng,Tom can already do that.
5095335,eng,He never had men who followed him by reason of affection and gοod-will.
6251477,eng,I think I could do that if I tried.
2952443,eng,I still think it's funny.
2549131,eng,I worry about you.
1293181,eng,He admitted his defeat.
7392180,eng,She'll eat when she gets home.
7179800,eng,Tom said that I looked hungry.
2853873,eng,The man suspected of murdering Tom has been arrested by the police.
7504028,eng,Did you know that it only took Tom three hours to do that?
7177594,eng,Tom said that Mary was likely to be fascinated by that.
6221328,eng,It'll be too cold to do that.
6033336,eng,Hasn't Tom suffered enough?
6693278,eng,Sami said he wanted to write a book about Layla.
6526797,eng,The new restaurant on Park Street isn't very good.
5836400,eng,Tom is the only guy I know who has a pilot's license.
569605,eng,"Will you go, too?"
5733226,eng,All requests are confidential.
6844860,eng,I'm not going to let you leave.
3916326,eng,Let me get him.
1093491,eng,Tom is a very good friend of mine.
1830377,eng,I would never eat anything that Tom makes.
5085537,eng,He could be happy if he wanted.
7563096,eng,I fell in love with Tom and was so happy for a time.
1485111,eng,You have no right to throw me out.
436663,eng,I have booked a table for four.
477982,eng,Betty turned down Muriel's offer.
6654828,eng,Tom said that he didn't know what he ought to do.
7171464,eng,I thought that you liked it here.
6418020,eng,Mary doesn't really care how she does that.
57969,eng,Do you know how to pronounce this word?
7516519,eng,I know that Tom is a very patient man.
7266205,eng,Sami told Layla not to hang out with Farid.
6516194,eng,Tom and Mary eat hotdogs whenever they can.
268394,eng,How long will it take to get in to ride?
319992,eng,I know but I can't help it.
5187021,eng,I just like to have fun.
283625,eng,What he says sounds very sensible to me.
7163780,eng,I regret visiting Australia.
6494271,eng,Tom and Mary did everything they could to stop John from doing that.
6666578,eng,I can't find a good job.
7252554,eng,Sami wasn't into Layla.
9591,eng,Have you ever traveled in a plane?
7735463,eng,Tom didn't visit Boston.
6817070,eng,She hasn't gotten back to me yet.
6220077,eng,Tom has to be home.
37866,eng,It smelled really good.
7118033,eng,I'm legally deaf and blind.
6803340,eng,I assume you've talked to Tom.
6518937,eng,Tom and Mary realized they were trapped.
7184501,eng,I don't need to go to Australia next week.
4918923,eng,I can't go tomorrow.
7219855,eng,Sami doesn't remember his age.
4631560,eng,Your sentences were like a green meadow in winter.
7294470,eng,Sami just came up to me and gave me his number.
6251090,eng,Let's eat lunch earlier than usual.
2245709,eng,I disobeyed you.
2276448,eng,I won't be a moment.
4498992,eng,Tom's going with me tomorrow.
6027174,eng,Layla was known by everybody.
6355466,eng,Come on. You can do that.
249172,eng,We came to the conclusion that he had been right.
7245484,eng,Sami can hurt you.
2245852,eng,I had help.
3910257,eng,You'll see her.
6244802,eng,Tom won't be permitted to do that again.
7516721,eng,I know Tom could force you to do that.
6598545,eng,"An idea not properly analized is not worth to exploit, the same as a life without self judgment is not worth to be lived."
3142839,eng,I'm still waiting for you to answer to my question.
3177935,eng,Maybe you're not getting enough sleep.
509611,eng,My life had no linguistic meaning... until the day I met Saeb.
7126664,eng,Tom was named chairman in 2013.
47388,eng,The child dreads his visit to the dentist.
5490917,eng,I would like to learn Latvian.
2217622,eng,I didn't know what to do when my girlfriend told me she was pregnant.
1801080,eng,You really married that whore.
6267063,eng,You won't have to do that.
920284,eng,Poland is a big country.
6106122,eng,How long are you going to cling to past glory.
1346179,eng,I'll rinse your mouth out with soap!
2561317,eng,Who's next?
4526790,eng,The waiters bumped into each other.
6058063,eng,Layla is a self-absorbed woman.
7406112,eng,They tore pages out of their notebooks.
6501919,eng,I don't think Tom and Mary have any teaching experience.
1561317,eng,You two deserve each other.
6504258,eng,Tom and Mary don't think they're permitted to do that.
5872043,eng,Detectives were watching Fadil's reactions.
6622089,eng,Tom and Mary play bridge.
6336652,eng,I wonder if Tom really asked Mary to do that.
2490336,eng,The villagers fear him.
5735985,eng,Tom couldn't have agreed more.
305705,eng,They may not know about it.
6120538,eng,Tom didn't sign the confession voluntarily.
2740552,eng,I confess that I don’t find this useful.
631186,eng,I felt light as a feather.
3409265,eng,Tom didn't have any brothers or sisters.
2986060,eng,Go down into the cellar and get us a couple of bottles of wine.
3426142,eng,You didn't do anything that I wouldn't have done.
3575417,eng,"Hey, get your hands off me."
6525406,eng,Both Tom and Mary coughed.
3728352,eng,I don't know if I can cope with it.
328882,eng,Witch hazel tightens pores without drying skin.
1929186,eng,Let me put on my glasses since I can't hear you.
55606,eng,This is little different from what I want.
3597500,eng,Tom's funeral is on Monday.
58793,eng,This drama consists of just two short scenes.
1422481,eng,"Foreigners are interesting, aren't they?"
3753027,eng,"The boy was frightened, and tried to say a prayer, but he could remember nothing but the multiplication table."
4445229,eng,When you go to the beach you see the immensity of the universe contained in the ocean.
2042904,eng,"You can say anything you want about me, but don't say anything bad about Tom."
6255100,eng,Tom says he knows Mary won't be at the meeting on Monday.
3736482,eng,I don't want to do anything tonight.
6500878,eng,Tom and Mary are going to take the bus that leaves at 2:30.
2886573,eng,Get out of the water.
7185914,eng,I'm sorry you've been badly injured.
6449962,eng,My bike was stolen from the museum.
5790111,eng,Did you enjoy the salad?
4715851,eng,Tom didn't attend today's meeting.
2891422,eng,Is that about right?
5958324,eng,I turned on the tap.
312566,eng,She devoted her life to education.
6225055,eng,Tom hasn't told Mary what she has to do yet.
48630,eng,The rich friend gave him the cold shoulder.
2203144,eng,We're optimistic.
6505171,eng,How do you know that's where Tom and Mary are now?
6433220,eng,Tom drove to the hospital as fast as he could.
2860781,eng,Nature made sure that living happily doesn't require much effort: everyone can make himself happy.
6352229,eng,I'd better leave early today.
7237075,eng,Sami had the rest of the day to himself.
264761,eng,Do everything at your own risk.
954048,eng,"It seemed so real, but I guess it was just a crazy dream."
5831997,eng,I really think I'd like to be a minister's wife when I grow up.
6422865,eng,I don't want Mary to swim by herself.
2958687,eng,Tom wasn't impressed by what he saw.
1201492,eng,Where are you off to?
2876839,eng,She always says that.
4497492,eng,Tom didn't think the pain would ever stop.
5289577,eng,Japan tried to revive itself.
284646,eng,"He has three sons, who work in the same office."
6516882,eng,Tom and Mary said they'd do that if I did.
7438819,eng,They said they thought that I was lazy.
251433,eng,"As far as I know, he is an honest man."
7513105,eng,I know that Tom is a very talented painter.
3917045,eng,Wait for her.
7407730,eng,They gave their old car to me.
6527494,eng,Do Tom and Mary like the same kind of movies?
1521947,eng,The young widow got engaged once more.
6051778,eng,You messed up the deal.
1093778,eng,Tom had trouble getting online.
6241828,eng,I thought you said you'd help us do that.
6437537,eng,I thought it'd be more expensive.
318364,eng,Critics are just crying wolf about protectionism.
6430737,eng,It's going to be difficult for Tom to win.
7673574,eng,Tom lives in a nice little apartment.
6678243,eng,I could've saved Tom's life.
7149794,eng,Why don't you come to Australia?
3360844,eng,I've been writing letters all morning. I've written ten and still haven't finished.
7541576,eng,Neither Tom nor Mary has expensive tastes.
5975555,eng,I don't like chess.
3204133,eng,I don't know why Tom didn't just tell us.
6098801,eng,Tom realized that Mary had been lying to him.
3464003,eng,What I mean is that there are limits that need to be established and respected.
6425900,eng,Mary started talking to herself.
7538768,eng,"Tom wants to go home now, but Mary wants to stay a little longer."
325403,eng,Let me hear your frank opinion.
6698782,eng,Tom was the one who taught me how to ski.
5128374,eng,All the paintings in the room hung crooked.
6658716,eng,Tom is a secretive guy.
7735111,eng,I'm proud of what you've been able to do.
63621,eng,A considerable number of students want to go to college.
7541667,eng,Tom seemed a little too eager to do that.
67708,eng,I feel tense and agitated when I have too much work to do.
2199152,eng,I'm the boss around here.
2938697,eng,"In addition, we will issue the 'employee of the month' award afterwards."
5494433,eng,Tom isn't at all stupid.
7471265,eng,Tom and Mary have scars all over their bodies.
6396641,eng,Sami was busy preparing his speech.
3820981,eng,What else could Tom say?
287789,eng,His parents approve of the engagement.
3831462,eng,Your first draft was fine.
6348334,eng,You looked like you were worried.
6799254,eng,Just leave everything to us.
6089135,eng,Did anyone know how to do that?
6111887,eng,Layla was waiting for Sami in her tent.
6415470,eng,Mary said she probably isn't going to do that.
254452,eng,On the whole I am satisfied with the experiment.
5519440,eng,It is thought that manual firearms appeared in the 14th century.
44901,eng,We found only a small number of customers in the store.
1290241,eng,He didn't order dinner yet.
6500904,eng,Maybe that's the reason why Tom and Mary aren't here today.
6793026,eng,Are you having problems losing weight?
2854382,eng,I don't know if she will come or not.
7168707,eng,I think that Tom is intense.
51157,eng,"I warned you not to do so, didn't I?"
6424212,eng,Mary has everything that she wants.
7250097,eng,Sami taught biology.
2014038,eng,We wanted to do it right away.
48335,eng,You can only let the matter take its own course.
7208931,eng,Sami put the suitcase in his closet.
6531096,eng,I'd like to meet your family.
4446244,eng,Spanish used to be the Philippines' official language.
6817050,eng,Here's the map that you've been looking for.
2062722,eng,Have I done something wrong?
1552463,eng,Do you know anything about Tom's parents?
4462785,eng,You have to stop helping Mary.
7403234,eng,He decided he'd had enough.
64543,eng,Do you want the doctors to use the machine to make your brother breathe?
3419523,eng,"I don't know much about Finland, except that it's very cold."
6907875,eng,Does Tom wash dishes at home?
6945936,eng,I'm sure Tom did that just to make Mary jealous.
3989505,eng,Dan didn't even show his hands.
6311246,eng,Are you telling me that he raped you?
5431826,eng,I'm regularly feeling down in the dumps.
6435565,eng,Tom said that Mary was doing that now.
47682,eng,Please try me for the job.
6501446,eng,I was surprised to learn that Tom and Mary were liberals.
6319977,eng,Sami and Layla had a wonderful life together.
1002109,eng,It can't get worse.
6537928,eng,"Sami worked very hard to provide a better life for his daugther, Layla."
240329,eng,The number of people who die in traffic accidents is surprising.
7443912,eng,Tom and Mary told me they're unconvinced.
7347808,eng,It is unlikely that it'll rain tomorrow.
685834,eng,Don't vilify me!
7071524,eng,Don't forget to encode it first!
6653162,eng,Tom said that he plans to do that.
5774004,eng,The Internet can deliver the entirety of human knowledge to a young girl in a remote village on a single hand-held device.
53833,eng,Jane's farewell speech made us very sad.
6064232,eng,My mother didn't bake me a birthday cake this year.
2033471,eng,I want to know how you did it.
7514656,eng,I know that Tom is a little disappointed.
7737733,eng,I'm sorry that I came.
7155276,eng,"You aren't the only one here from Australia, are you?"
321483,eng,My shoes are bigger than yours.
50982,eng,What will you live on while you are there?
315619,eng,She ran very fast to catch up with the other members.
6260122,eng,Tom and Mary are still going out with each other.
7392306,eng,She showed a photo of her mother to us.
6242833,eng,What software do you use the most often?
6089467,eng,It's my glass.
2643193,eng,Tom said he didn't feel well.
2644551,eng,I think Tom might be busy.
27901,eng,Please call in a doctor.
5131988,eng,I would like to change money.
16594,eng,Will you take on the job?
4015829,eng,What department do you work for?
1517284,eng,"When she was in kindergarten, all the boys used to call her ""princess""."
3131601,eng,"Your Majesty, there is a fire in my house!"
7120200,eng,This will hurt.
3287458,eng,There's nothing I'd like more than to spend the afternoon with you.
4426145,eng,He put on a hat.
6336642,eng,I wonder if Tom really could help us.
6513363,eng,Did Tom and Mary tell you that they'd be late?
1094210,eng,Tom drives a Toyota.
6225697,eng,Tom let Mary know that he had done that already.
6340670,eng,I didn't have time to do everything I had to do.
5267566,eng,The town managed to thwart plans to build a nuclear power plant nearby.
3731454,eng,How can I make Tom stop?
6418592,eng,Mary said she didn't think Tom was asleep.
1913266,eng,If I'd only taken the time to read the instruction manual!
3280395,eng,Did I forget to mention that?
5937082,eng,Tom has been accused of being a spy.
7160891,eng,Sami heard Layla banging on the door.
3312379,eng,We have to get Tom out of here.
7475181,eng,"They drank some beer, didn't they?"
4666292,eng,Won't Tom ever come back?
318150,eng,It's a beautiful day.
2276394,eng,Tom's body was never found.
7070639,eng,Are you a dog person?
7117729,eng,I didn't have enough money to pay for the meal.
4495741,eng,Tom should be arrested.
2249409,eng,Just don't talk.
6113709,eng,I hope you can schedule time to do that.
6420285,eng,Mary knows exactly what she ought to do.
3341851,eng,Tom's face lit up when Mary entered the room.
6431101,eng,Do Tom and Mary both eat meat?
6520515,eng,Have Tom and Mary ever done that?
2425754,eng,May God help you!
328428,eng,You just have to understand what sort of thing the suffix '-osity' is.
7399312,eng,He was stunned by what he saw.
7113748,eng,I can't leave it there.
6418191,eng,Does Mary think she'll stay in Boston long?
7504973,eng,Tom realized that there was a good chance he might die.
2839718,eng,You're testing my patience!
254669,eng,I have not read the book nor do I want to.
7406699,eng,They have bruises on their faces.
271097,eng,The world will change in an instant.
7166011,eng,Sami didn't want to think too much about it.
7278529,eng,Sami sat next to Layla on the rollercoaster. Farid was behind them.
4785509,eng,Tom is trying hard to give up smoking.
4962874,eng,Tom is probably still hiding.
239704,eng,"Needless to say, he is right."
323805,eng,The alarm went off.
2192201,eng,Is this wine from Argentina?
6676061,eng,I suspect that Tom and Mary are competitive.
6770134,eng,I've never actually done that.
6410690,eng,I'm sure Mary won't be very hungry when she gets home.
2867001,eng,Mary hates spiders.
3721637,eng,I can't believe you remembered.
6508942,eng,Tom and Mary are the ones who said they'd do that.
6824105,eng,Maybe Tom should tell Mary.
6254989,eng,I think Tom already knows why Mary didn't want to do that.
293808,eng,He was completely tired from walking all day.
264292,eng,I said that I would be twenty next birthday.
7733201,eng,Tickets go on sale next Monday.
62248,eng,When would you like to have your coffee?
47950,eng,The lecture gripped the audience.
20145,eng,He was created a peer.
72563,eng,No fewer than five hundred students were present.
6243861,eng,Tom said he thought you wouldn't do that.
6567224,eng,Sami listens to Christian music.
5825713,eng,You don't know how tired I was.
274810,eng,A lot of students are present at the meeting.
2712828,eng,Tom walked quickly down the street.
2243300,eng,They sat down.
7377778,eng,Mary backed into her parking space.
6223301,eng,Both Tom and I drink too much coffee.
7010500,eng,France's birth rate is declining.
5115975,eng,Mary sorrowfully buried her mother.
3419482,eng,I'll hug you to death.
400145,eng,The news of his death spread around.
6655056,eng,Tom said that he didn't feel like dancing.
6121046,eng,I have never met my children.
240759,eng,"Fortunately, my son quickly adjusted to life in his new school."
5251931,eng,How dare you say such things about Tom?
5394326,eng,The footsteps moved closer.
5737962,eng,That was our understanding.
5326090,eng,I have three years of experience.
7144088,eng,I didn't think that Tom would be asleep.
6815336,eng,Eugènie has large buttocks.
6814365,eng,Do you still want to go home?
5289827,eng,I don't think Tom did anything.
5785943,eng,Would you like me to sing?
2091101,eng,No one says that.
20288,eng,I'm not feeling well.
7393220,eng,He said he didn't feel like a hero.
7130670,eng,Tom certainly made it sound fantastic.
47891,eng,The government of that country oppresses its people.
2713450,eng,You'll be busy tomorrow.
3918272,eng,I'm going to find them.
1773679,eng,No one believes her.
6838175,eng,The business is in good hands.
7241981,eng,Sami can't be around people smoking weed.
3920178,eng,Just ask him.
7203046,eng,Sami and Layla got along very well.
6500038,eng,Tom and Mary have enough money to buy whatever they want.
237782,eng,The army abandoned the town to the enemy.
3920385,eng,You're after them.
5667985,eng,That's what I hope Tom will do.
5296309,eng,Would you please hold on?
7502862,eng,Tom has decided that he isn't going go to Boston next summer.
7287691,eng,Sami was doing something stupid.
7172377,eng,I thought that there was a good chance that Tom wouldn't want to go with us.
6242986,eng,One of your front tires looks a bit low.
7543261,eng,Tom isn't someone we should trust.
3919169,eng,Just buy her some candy.
278310,eng,The pain shoots into my right leg.
6108272,eng,I'd like to do that this evening.
1092927,eng,Tom should have plenty of time.
7387657,eng,She doesn't want to sell her land.
316204,eng,She had no sooner read his letter than she tore it up.
7286423,eng,Sami felt so weird in that house.
4728072,eng,He's proposing a suggestion for altering the research method.
7241333,eng,Sami can sit wherever he wants.
5734477,eng,We want to keep improving it.
7232055,eng,I don't think that I've ever seen you do that by yourself.
4091700,eng,I have four children.
552150,eng,I'm taking a trip to Armenia next year.
954605,eng,"When I got out of jail, the first thing I bought was an economy car."
6130544,eng,No one correctly predicted the repercussions of these policies.
3759380,eng,Why didst thou not bring thy wife along with thee?
1320881,eng,Tom doesn't know the difference between astronomy and astrology.
6810570,eng,Sami doesn't have time right now.
7737267,eng,Why did you buy those glasses?
321869,eng,I could hardly keep from laughing.
6898702,eng,Tom and Mary wanted to be alone together.
3955714,eng,The thickness of Saturn's rings ranges from 10 to 100 meters and the rings vary in brightness.
6705559,eng,My neck is sore.
3805288,eng,How come I'm the only one who ever mows the lawn around here?
5744145,eng,What you need is clarity.
2546003,eng,I'm going straight home.
5389383,eng,He ended up not coming.
7406044,eng,They told me to stay out of their rooms.
7735087,eng,My stepmother isn't much older than I am.
296698,eng,"He tried it again, but in vain."
7474742,eng,They say they also want to do that.
4979461,eng,We need paper.
3980989,eng,Tom got a tetanus shot after being bitten by a dog.
6149537,eng,"This clothing is my coworker's, not mine."
6420816,eng,Mary says everyone she knows does that.
2650893,eng,Chemistry is the study of matter.
3000813,eng,He spent his entire life helping people.
6662848,eng,I often ignore Tom's advice.
290882,eng,"He ought to pass the examination, for he is very capable."
6476420,eng,Every dollar you're investing in this project is worth it.
6823377,eng,Nobody voted for Tom.
26500,eng,We need to reorganize it in order to strengthen our business activities.
7110791,eng,I think that Tom is insightful.
2235816,eng,It wasn't Tom.
3825615,eng,Is it complicated?
6660192,eng,Tom didn't tell the police that he'd seen Mary that night.
7390322,eng,He paid off his credit card debt.
39575,eng,Texas is nearly twice as large as Japan.
6439784,eng,Who told Tom to hug Mary?
2721334,eng,"You told the dog to stay, didn't you?"
7525207,eng,Tom won't want to sit next to Mary.
7578503,eng,Kabyle is the most spoken Berber dialect in Algeria.
5246237,eng,I think that they were all fired.
6693681,eng,Sami lived hundreds of miles away.
7516281,eng,Tom soon realized that he was trapped.
1897720,eng,It might be a good idea to get some sleep.
7397486,eng,He said he had to go home early.
7349386,eng,Tom has done it more than once.
6426461,eng,Mary swore she'd never do that.
1640944,eng,That is very exciting.
3904674,eng,I just want you to love me.
1417815,eng,The bus went over the cliff.
7732063,eng,Tom usually stands behind the counter.
7516954,eng,Tom didn't see anybody he recognized.
7538946,eng,Tom took some pictures of his new car and sent them to Mary.
6258180,eng,Tom should probably tell Mary he doesn't like John.
704166,eng,So that's Tatoeba.
2958634,eng,Tom was surprised how well Mary could play ping pong.
838807,eng,She became a famous painter.
6424018,eng,Mary said she had no other details.
3171889,eng,I'm pleased with Tom's performance.
250702,eng,My brother is big enough to travel alone.
299096,eng,"Young as he is, he is a good lawyer."
6342746,eng,Tom isn't the one who turned on the lights.
6614043,eng,"Although I was present, I didn't hear your words."
6515268,eng,Tom and Mary didn't deny that they did that.
38341,eng,I almost think you're right.
2387526,eng,I need some money.
45920,eng,The student has already solved all the problems.
2299128,eng,He skimmed the text.
7165113,eng,Sami is Farid's ex-roommate.
2537375,eng,It may not be necessary for us to go to that meeting.
1818963,eng,What would you do if your house was haunted?
5840549,eng,I'm too slow.
3151561,eng,"Give me a beer, please."
6666459,eng,I think Tom should've been more discreet.
7112393,eng,I was a lawyer for thirty years.
6870219,eng,I wish I could have played better.
4500314,eng,That actually sounds quite interesting.
6508817,eng,I think Tom and Mary are pretty good artists.
2308305,eng,I couldn't understand a word.
7476182,eng,They say that they were busy.
44503,eng,The sight of the ruins brought home to him the meaning of war.
3636599,eng,What is his surname?
41887,eng,It is up to you how you take it.
278362,eng,The streets were decorated with flags.
7389323,eng,He's updating his website.
6707200,eng,Donald was the name of my English teacher.
310570,eng,She has a funny face.
7231278,eng,I don't think that Tom has much free time.
6508354,eng,Tom and Mary say they don't know why you did that.
7537666,eng,Why do you think that would be impossible?
5746974,eng,Tom drives a light truck.
4501072,eng,There were three coffee mugs on the table.
6359718,eng,"One summer evening he came galloping down the road and pulled up at the gate. She was at the doorway, and came down to meet him."
5469908,eng,"According to a Spanish proverb you should never read the Bible, unless you want to become an atheist."
4529162,eng,It's amazing that we all didn't get killed.
6410582,eng,Mary is the only one who seems to be enjoying herself.
5774840,eng,We stayed overnight in Boston.
6339295,eng,I'd put the mayonnaise in the refrigerator if I were you.
3823987,eng,It was Tom who asked Mary to come here.
5825269,eng,"It was a dreadful thing for you to lose your temper like that, Anne."
6409925,eng,Mary wasn't certain whether or not she should tell Tom.
6851153,eng,Mary had a sneaking suspicion that Kate had met up with Tom after the party.
7272415,eng,Sami got to his mom's house.
5822634,eng,I don't think Tom will be able to do what you're asking him to do.
1743083,eng,A computer is to the brain like a bike is to the legs.
7539754,eng,Neither Tom nor Mary has been around for very long.
7537761,eng,Who told Tom that he needed to do that?
7098238,eng,There is nothing questionable about him.
3819424,eng,I hope I don't end up like Tom.
3733806,eng,The women stopped working.
2290423,eng,I didn't need to see that.
6358570,eng,Tom thinks Mary can win.
7384260,eng,She does anything we tell her.
3122320,eng,I need to get to the hospital.
7202122,eng,Sami sent Layla nudes through text message.
7511096,eng,I don't know that I'm not supposed to do that.
7514068,eng,I know Tom could convince Mary to do that.
1025318,eng,Tom has poor eyesight.
6873485,eng,"Tom had a knife, didn't he?"
5512548,eng,We'll do what we always do.
5738721,eng,We love each other dearly.
6770338,eng,Are Tom and Mary optimistic?
49858,eng,Don't tell me the end of the mystery.
6504148,eng,It would surprise me if Tom and Mary don't do that.
2166207,eng,Your room is big.
1572839,eng,My students are learning to drive.
3327783,eng,Can I go in there now?
3912886,eng,Tell me why you don't like him.
3887839,eng,"Reading between the lines, it's clear that Tom isn't having such a good time in his new job."
6426006,eng,Mary said she'd do that herself.
7518428,eng,I know Tom is motivated to do that.
3129338,eng,That happens to be true.
3905067,eng,We don't trust them.
6234307,eng,"You know I shouldn't do that anymore, don't you?"
297716,eng,He advised me to see a lawyer. This I did at once.
6504616,eng,I hope Tom and Mary didn't say they wanted to do that.
1025912,eng,Tom doesn't want to live by himself.
2274029,eng,You just got lucky.
7475060,eng,They say that they like marigolds.
6870544,eng,Tom would have been here by now if his car hadn't broken down.
6355725,eng,Tom isn't a drug dealer.
2644956,eng,Tom couldn't kill anyone.
620723,eng,He promised he would tell us.
4950738,eng,Help us reach our goal.
298987,eng,He belongs to the camera club.
2365771,eng,We’re here looking at the New York soundscape.
4664478,eng,Nobody will convince me otherwise.
7127086,eng,How would you resolve such issues?
6517873,eng,Tom and Mary said they wanted to help us.
3171531,eng,Tom found it hard to keep the conversation going.
7194914,eng,Are you really going to Australia next month?
2036490,eng,I always said that Croatia is the country of marvels.
1867810,eng,Tom walked into Mary's office.
3099068,eng,You're going to be OK. Don't worry.
2359262,eng,I've been thinking about this for a while.
6698403,eng,Sami returned with help to finish the job.
918780,eng,"Even those who have renounced Christianity and attack it, in their inmost being still follow the Christian ideal, for hitherto neither their subtlety nor the ardor of their hearts has been able to create a higher ideal of man and of virtue than the ideal given by Christ."
6458014,eng,They walked barefoot over the sand dunes.
6243434,eng,I don't think that what I did was wrong.
64111,eng,"Shall I fetch your glasses from the living room, Dad?"
6229301,eng,Tom says that he won't be allowed to do that until he's eighteen years old.
3818329,eng,How was your interview yesterday?
6500658,eng,I'd be disappointed if Tom and Mary don't come to our party.
323181,eng,Please remember to wake me up at six tomorrow morning.
7329333,eng,Sami came to lunch with us.
5796818,eng,I don't care that you don't love me. I love myself.
6254396,eng,Tom doesn't want to be here anymore.
2359616,eng,I've got a sandwich.
7114570,eng,I'll do that in Boston.
4800398,eng,That's interesting. Why would you do that?
6520410,eng,Tom and Mary said they'd wait and see.
45482,eng,The president was a farmer when he was young.
5293081,eng,Tom drew a circle in the sand with a stick.
6437268,eng,Tom taught Mary a new song today.
4923525,eng,They aren't just any 3-D glasses.
2892770,eng,Where are you going to sleep?
3577169,eng,The refugees endured the 18-hour walk across the desert.
287926,eng,His story cannot be true.
7734301,eng,Preparations for the party are nearly complete.
3826027,eng,I have some difficulty breathing.
848670,eng,"Some English speakers think that omission of the subject does not occur in their language, however, the subject of phrases like ""thank you"" or ""bless you"" is omitted."
2548741,eng,I'm a little shaky.
6430213,eng,Tom wanted to get somebody to do that for Mary.
6066901,eng,Does anyone here know how this works?
69638,eng,Are you on your way to the station?
6709886,eng,Sami glared at Layla.
3920936,eng,I was sorry to hear about her.
1989816,eng,The children rode a toboggan down the hill in the snowy weather.
6040372,eng,Tom wasn't very good last year.
586891,eng,Could you please do me a favor?
2229994,eng,They asked Mary why she was crying.
5923939,eng,Don't take presents from strangers.
1096255,eng,Do you know where Tom bought his new computer?
50956,eng,I'm very glad I wasn't there.
7275601,eng,Sami was on his way to his class.
6221303,eng,Everyone seems to be afraid.
7334488,eng,Layla was shaving her legs in her room.
7149123,eng,Sami left me alone with all those people.
6346147,eng,I wonder if Tom is still nervous.
2359565,eng,I've got a couple errands to run.
307026,eng,They lived in the countryside during the war.
7505000,eng,Tom has already decided that he isn't going to buy one.
1029559,eng,Tom bought something for Mary.
3144307,eng,Tom tends to be a bit grumpy.
265513,eng,What have you done about fixing the car?
5936458,eng,I'm willing to work late today if you need me to.
296905,eng,He called on me yesterday.
7127381,eng,How does this help any of the victims?
49161,eng,No suspicion may be attached to the accountant.
270868,eng,Swimming is one thing I enjoy.
1309797,eng,I'm very worried about you.
6043803,eng,Layla sold her company.
7328810,eng,Sami forced Layla to wear the hijab.
7159756,eng,"Tom is still studying in Australia, isn't he?"
6220378,eng,I turned off the motor.
6496841,eng,Tom and Mary told John that they didn't want to study French.
390076,eng,Love is a great contradiction. You cannot live without it but at the same time you will be hurt by it.
281405,eng,Some Japanese wives are content to leave their husbands alone.
3922910,eng,Tom picked up his toys.
2252887,eng,We put up a good fight but we lost.
4500702,eng,This new medicine may save lives.
6823777,eng,Tom grew up in a middle-class neighborhood.
5744516,eng,The course was difficult.
5175112,eng,I hope to see Tom soon.
5848968,eng,How can I make a girl fall in love with me?
6530896,eng,How many stitches did you get?
3911928,eng,Don't you miss him?
7470567,eng,Tom and Mary did the only thing that they could do.
3881628,eng,I feel so lonely when you're not here.
6500575,eng,Tom and Mary are trying to make the best of a bad situation.
255164,eng,I will carry out my aim at any expense.
5564404,eng,She showed little interest in the photos.
7384387,eng,He'd do that if you asked him to.
923788,eng,Heaven gives life to people and causes them to have all kinds of desires.
3162935,eng,Tom trimmed his beard for the wedding.
1364617,eng,He keeps an aardvark as a pet.
7176220,eng,Tom thinks that he knows it all.
301675,eng,He nodded to me as he passed.
5651922,eng,Mary isn't Tom's wife.
7406286,eng,They said they were a little nervous.
6528167,eng,I try to brush my teeth after every meal.
3449082,eng,It matters to us.
31247,eng,"With a little more wisdom, he would not have got in trouble."
254961,eng,I stood waiting for a bus.
29217,eng,Our soccer team was covered in glory.
5131434,eng,He scolded me.
1898362,eng,I never want to see you again.
3916595,eng,I borrowed money from her.
4500990,eng,Tom won the match.
3821712,eng,I love to help others.
266156,eng,The Prime Minister stated that he would not introduce a new tax without the consensus of public opinion.
7196735,eng,I'm not surprised Tom won.
316532,eng,She has to look after her mother.
301526,eng,He's back from his travels in Central Asia.
1762511,eng,I like to comb my hair.
6265841,eng,Tom wouldn't do that that way.
7532037,eng,Fight back!
2182753,eng,Have you ever been in love?
5720842,eng,He published two books in Finnish.
6444957,eng,Sami is such an incompetent engineer.
5178437,eng,Let's switch to French.
6378655,eng,Sami showed his wife much affection.
3201916,eng,Can you tell me where to find Tom?
259545,eng,I walked along the street.
22331,eng,We have some pressing problems to solve.
5922439,eng,"At first, I thought I had an advantage because I spoke a Romance language."
332190,eng,With all due respect.
5228788,eng,He reread the poem.
7390095,eng,She nearly fell off her chair.
6505737,eng,I don't think Tom and Mary have health insurance.
6717411,eng,Sami paid Layla to do this.
6799560,eng,The same thing happened to us.
7384800,eng,He did all of his homework.
4015711,eng,How long have they been gone?
7493851,eng,Where did Tom park his car?
5745921,eng,We're confident as well.
6508472,eng,Tom and Mary are supposed to speak with John.
6228289,eng,I don't trust Tom any longer.
6426533,eng,Mary said that she was stunned.
283480,eng,I am suspicious of him.
2641036,eng,I have a wife and three sons in Boston.
2245204,eng,Come on everybody.
4014962,eng,"That was pretty interesting, wasn't it?"
6431682,eng,Tom is never going to have to worry about going hungry.
5762738,eng,When are we leaving?
6406828,eng,"Even though I'd been trying to avoid Mary, I ran into her in front of the library."
4971276,eng,Everything was new to me.
6237660,eng,"You've worked in Boston before, haven't you?"
6129173,eng,Sami received tons of e-mails.
7520010,eng,Did you know that I have a blog?
3428940,eng,Good speech will break the bones of a ghost.
33429,eng,A button came off my coat.
7231675,eng,I don't think that Tom is homeless.
251506,eng,My silence is not to be read as consent.
5938725,eng,I almost never get scared.
3727326,eng,Tom wouldn't pay his bills.
868540,eng,I like to eat hot soup.
6810801,eng,Sami put his hand on the Bible and swore to tell the truth.
1989335,eng,"I never really studied C++ beyond ""Hello, world!"""
6435182,eng,Tom was too afraid to go into the cave.
239587,eng,Some people are never content with what they have.
6653531,eng,Tom said he knew that he might be permitted to do that by himself.
843929,eng,He hid behind the door.
3731257,eng,Can you leave it with me till this afternoon?
315447,eng,She made a trip to Europe last month.
295823,eng,He is anything but a reliable man.
6502297,eng,I don't think Tom and Mary want to go swimming with us.
2259727,eng,Three bulbs have burned out.
6658763,eng,Tom thought the movie was good.
3436661,eng,Tom lives in a very large house.
799906,eng,You should go to the gym at least twice a week.
7221854,eng,There's a possibility Tom won't want to go to Australia with us.
2290416,eng,I didn't mean to involve you.
3825614,eng,Was it complicated?
5832004,eng,I doubt that Tom would do that.
6522092,eng,Tom and Mary respect their parents.
4011548,eng,It was very nice meeting you.
6494374,eng,Tom and Mary were able to do that better than I thought they would.
7507753,eng,Tom didn't tell anyone he was planning to do that.
321917,eng,I urged him to get away and cool down.
6676476,eng,I suspect that Tom won't want to dance.
6340069,eng,When was the last time you used this pair of skis?
6247486,eng,Tom got exactly what he said he wanted.
6254916,eng,I've always lived on Park Street.
6432903,eng,Tom said Mary probably won't eat lunch with us.
1164421,eng,Tom may not think this is funny.
2325965,eng,I faxed a map to Tom.
6524243,eng,I wonder whether Tom is drunk or not.
2769113,eng,Will you do it for me?
268860,eng,Is there a law here about jaywalking?
5645299,eng,"I love you, Raphael!"
7513551,eng,Tom thought that I didn't have to do that.
7175928,eng,Tom thinks that Mary won't be reluctant to do that.
5101710,eng,I will add a couple of explanations.
6952591,eng,The door will be open.
3434254,eng,Duck your head.
7215389,eng,Sami wants to beat Farid's ass.
7236306,eng,I suspect that Tom and Mary were surprised when John walked into the room.
7438689,eng,They said that they weren't intoxicated.
2359933,eng,I've made a decision.
2897294,eng,You all don't speak English.
6528928,eng,Tom is having the same problems I am.
5360450,eng,We sat around the campfire roasting marshmallows.
7407514,eng,They went to their parents' place.
3729632,eng,That doesn't mean I can stay.
2301900,eng,I can't believe I'm not getting fired.
7389498,eng,She said she'd overstayed her visa.
1951587,eng,I can't explain it.
2986061,eng,Get a grip on yourself.
6256403,eng,We might study French next year.
2862121,eng,We lied to you.
4063772,eng,I'm so sorry I hurt you.
3908938,eng,Can I tell them why?
53577,eng,But the answers were all wrong.
2388078,eng,I never doubted you.
2258092,eng,A truck stopped crosswise in the middle of the road.
7383875,eng,He wants you to wait for him.
6815222,eng,The most beautiful days of the year have already passed.
3856037,eng,I wanted to be with him and that is why I left my friends from the background.
7136626,eng,I thought that the sound was a firecracker at first.
1798626,eng,I have never written a play.
3734587,eng,I have learned to work with Tom.
7382205,eng,Mary sold her company.
2753726,eng,How is it written?
6221882,eng,Tom no longer teaches here.
6651257,eng,Tom said he wished that he hadn't told Mary to try to convince John to do that.
3904100,eng,I've got business with them.
2824746,eng,She hated vanilla.
5826165,eng,We found a stream and swam a little bit.
6263908,eng,Tom didn't see the truck coming.
1602727,eng,Mary is smart and funny.
3204956,eng,Tell me you understand that what you did was wrong.
5079025,eng,"Thanks, you're an angel."
5420541,eng,Shortly after they had gone to bed they were suddenly alarmed by a fearful crash in the hall.
6262103,eng,That's the hat I want to buy.
3273045,eng,It seems the meeting cannot take place. Two attendees are stuck in Charles de Gaulle airport.
36186,eng,Nancy was surprised that Bob won the first prize in the contest.
6760651,eng,"Are you hungry, too?"
53024,eng,Judy is kind to everyone.
7334194,eng,Layla started wearing the hijab in mid-semester.
2123556,eng,That's plastic.
6637293,eng,Do you think he'll agree?
34127,eng,A prism decomposes light.
6647794,eng,Tom says he knows what Mary is doing.
997098,eng,You need to stop gambling.
6501098,eng,Tom and Mary asked me not to pitch my tent next to theirs.
3028899,eng,Discussions were held debating the merits of appointing a provisional government to serve until formal elections could take place.
2214268,eng,You should've asked Tom first.
717915,eng,Adopting a child is a tough decision with plenty of bureaucracy to wade through.
3723590,eng,It gives you a unique perspective.
272059,eng,See to it that you keep quiet.
6260807,eng,I sat together at the counter.
3561899,eng,I knew you'd be talking about me.
869416,eng,"I hope you don't mind my mentioning this, but you know that I love you."
1040526,eng,"Tom was afraid that Mary might poke her eye out, so he told her to be careful."
3149217,eng,Man should smell like a man.
7150384,eng,Tom will never leave Australia.
242107,eng,This week I had three midterms.
5077188,eng,It's the easiest thing to remember.
6409665,eng,Mary said she thought she'd be able to find another job.
6246808,eng,Tom said he wasn't a good chess player.
7466940,eng,I chose all three options.
3906426,eng,Don't talk to us.
6870329,eng,Tom could have had this job.
3416941,eng,"Tom is pretty rich, isn't he?"
2799745,eng,I'll help you move to your new house.
6513530,eng,Tom and Mary told me that they were confused.
306134,eng,They're always having trouble with their word processor.
6685464,eng,I'm likely to feel like doing that tomorrow.
3737697,eng,Were you really surprised?
5157689,eng,Don't drive!
479759,eng,It's not rocket science.
2240301,eng,We miss Tom.
652607,eng,He promises not to drink anymore.
47995,eng,The hall was decorated with Japanese paintings.
6435816,eng,Why did you encourage Tom to do that?
6439439,eng,Tom is going to work today.
5579385,eng,I got even with Tom.
6973421,eng,Tom made an embarrassing mistake.
7183647,eng,Sami recorded it.
7042891,eng,The blaze has killed two firefighters.
6438872,eng,Tom knew that I'd be on time.
6873507,eng,"Tom didn't tell Mary, did he?"
4487627,eng,All but one of 8 planets of the Sun lack life.
6821892,eng,Do you really know what's going on?
6512284,eng,Do Tom and Mary still want to eat with us?
1094731,eng,Tom didn't know Mary had a brother.
7219068,eng,Sami has some bandages on.
6978260,eng,That wasn't very easy to take.
6976205,eng,You're entitled to your own opinion but not your own facts.
807161,eng,There is no reason for this fear.
6584669,eng,This is not my first time canoeing.
3910989,eng,I had to protect her.
6269702,eng,I didn't finish the race.
2986710,eng,"Mary is a very beautiful woman. On a scale of one to ten, she's an eleven."
6419798,eng,Mary wondered why Tom wouldn't help her.
3202352,eng,Who told you that you could sit here?
6839930,eng,The boy ran home.
6519587,eng,Tom and Mary say they'll give it a try.
3129322,eng,"Well, what's happening?"
2720589,eng,German banks are among Europe's most troubled.
7116850,eng,Tom became annoying.
4397914,eng,It wasn't as difficult to do as I thought it was going to be.
5961543,eng,My cat needs surgery.
1092687,eng,Tom told me that he didn't want to come home empty-handed.
6117876,eng,I think Tom told Mary the truth.
5466121,eng,Is Tom running away?
2957529,eng,Tom nervously approached the door.
5838276,eng,We just have to keep doing what we're doing.
2847491,eng,I thought it was funny.
6867817,eng,I'm not looking for sympathy.
285408,eng,It is evident from his behavior that he lies.
26203,eng,I'm studying English.
430198,eng,My father doesn't like soccer.
290252,eng,He was so near that I couldn't avoid him.
735079,eng,"Who swings too high, achieves nothing."
6501986,eng,Do you think Tom and Mary are still hesitant to do that?
3153301,eng,That was a terrible miss! cried the commentators.
3728130,eng,Let me make sure I have this straight.
7159846,eng,I'm going to Australia tomorrow.
7502705,eng,I know that Tom doesn't know why he has to do that by himself.
1813907,eng,Why doesn't he look at me anymore?
7196536,eng,Tom wasn't surprised nobody else was there.
3820416,eng,Tom bought a sweater.
2869260,eng,Where would Tom go?
6805701,eng,I gave everything I had to Tom.
268847,eng,I didn't notice the light turn red.
7182393,eng,Tom said he hoped that he never had to go back to Boston.
5158782,eng,Tom was the last to find out about it.
442110,eng,The cost of living has risen.
3309039,eng,Tom's gotten fatter since the last time I saw him.
6662587,eng,Tom has been spending a lot of time playing games.
59705,eng,This beef is four dollars per pound.
7228028,eng,There's no denying Tom is clever.
5226716,eng,I'm not going to go swimming this afternoon.
6473060,eng,Sami could have made something out of his life.
6411504,eng,Mary said she thought she might not have to do that.
6233135,eng,I don't think that doing that would be a bad idea.
6709402,eng,Sami didn't really make physical contact with Layla.
5094976,eng,Klearchos tried to force the soldiers to go; but they threw stones at him.
6347465,eng,Tom is likely to understand French.
7182706,eng,Tom said that he didn't think that he'd be able to do that without our help.
3823111,eng,We still have a lot to learn.
2645468,eng,Tell Tom to do the same.
4715895,eng,Tom takes very good care of his car.
290185,eng,He broke his leg skiing.
3181120,eng,You can talk to me.
7253795,eng,Sami doesn't know many people who do YouTube.
5670097,eng,This jam is homemade.
2923185,eng,When will you be back home?
7243605,eng,Sami liked his hair that way.
5228499,eng,This method has its pros and cons.
6515232,eng,Tom and Mary felt they didn't have a choice.
5725438,eng,They're paying really close attention.
6497317,eng,"When Tom and Mary first told me that, I didn't believe them."
281054,eng,The days are getting longer every day.
7243712,eng,Sami's hair was just a mess.
1661209,eng,I am playing guitar.
5742052,eng,Tom should be sent to jail.
1152248,eng,May I ask you a few questions?
3722867,eng,We'll make the time.
3000766,eng,"One day, I'm going to marry him."
5795070,eng,Why don't you buy a violin for Tom?
3903317,eng,Thanks for staying with her.
6425654,eng,Mary could quit if she wanted to.
6919033,eng,Tom and Mary are interesting people.
29628,eng,The apple-blossom was touched by the frost.
7737734,eng,I'm pretty sure that's how it happened.
7276323,eng,Layla was tired of drama.
3131472,eng,When is that supposed to happen?
2833407,eng,"During the Industrial Revolution, people worked 16 hours non-stop."
5641823,eng,I strongly advise against it.
6425832,eng,Mary told me she was happy here.
6709030,eng,Sami reported Layla missing to police.
7466926,eng,Mary works in a bookshop.
7127228,eng,How can you know if it helps or not?
6525139,eng,Tom and Mary both look like they want to say something.
6104593,eng,Tom was anxious to do that.
7405284,eng,He did all he could do.
3180652,eng,I've already told you all I know about that.
807144,eng,Mine owners refused to negotiate.
273864,eng,Grandfather is napping on the sofa.
2034054,eng,I don't want to hear about all your old girlfriends.
3732817,eng,Tom reminds me of myself when I was his age.
3921711,eng,Tom will never ever forget Mary.
261065,eng,I didn't know that she was ill.
6252756,eng,Tom tried to show me how to do that.
3226401,eng,This road is dangerous.
297055,eng,He has been in deep water since he got fired from his job.
2645913,eng,Tom does look familiar.
6526903,eng,"Tom and Mary are both very careless, aren't they?"
3722277,eng,Tom says he sees things that I can't see.
6267510,eng,Tom and I sat across from John and Mary.
6654167,eng,Tom said that he doesn't plan to go.
6262377,eng,I'm too young to drive a car.
5735853,eng,Tom gave me a meaningful look.
6663653,eng,"Tom was sitting on the floor, crying."
7245780,eng,Sami decided to confront Layla about it.
6342263,eng,Tom isn't the one who taught me how to swim.
7731504,eng,Tom is too much of a coward to go there by himself.
6145830,eng,Do you actually go to dancing class?
7402802,eng,She said that she's unafraid.
5203912,eng,Tom had other work to do.
6414672,eng,Mary said she was having a good time in Boston.
5767694,eng,How long have you been watching us?
6223458,eng,Tom says everyone he knows can swim.
6063754,eng,Is this an entrance to another dimension?
7190478,eng,Sami thought that Layla was the girl he was going to spend the rest of his life with.
6851148,eng,Just let the police handle it.
6355709,eng,I've overstayed my visa.
5043300,eng,A committee of experts determines how to allocate the money.
33243,eng,Bob's father teaches at a girls' school.
6583368,eng,Any takers?
6646587,eng,Tom told me he'll join us later.
7258713,eng,Sami was the person that hired me.
2033693,eng,I want you to put out that cigarette.
6343196,eng,Tom is the one who told me how to do that.
7402830,eng,She said that she'd be there.
6518200,eng,I believe Tom and Mary are innocent.
6411020,eng,Mary said she didn't want to say anything about that.
7737745,eng,I wish it would rain.
2436456,eng,Just give it a try.
6676793,eng,Did you like the movie that you went to yesterday?
304292,eng,He made good what he had promised to do.
46874,eng,The photo catches the tension in the court very well.
2290389,eng,I didn't know you had company.
6049217,eng,Does it make sense to you?
6978091,eng,It's watered down.
3312944,eng,We can go shopping later.
7400185,eng,He just did what he had to do.
34381,eng,Could we have a fork?
6345779,eng,I have to leave early in the morning.
5237310,eng,"It may not be natural for you, but at least try to be a little more gracious."
268447,eng,He said so in jest.
6038088,eng,Humans are fundamentally irrational.
698717,eng,That was really interesting.
6838544,eng,I know that Tom was present at today's meeting.
1079097,eng,"If you look at the song's lyrics, they really don't mean much."
6575313,eng,Sami had an aha moment.
6433330,eng,Tom thinks Mary is probably in the cafeteria.
3907822,eng,Tell her why.
3153982,eng,Would you like us to give you a lift?
2246033,eng,I noticed that.
3904140,eng,I should be with you.
3920534,eng,Why should I worry about you?
6355464,eng,Tom was scared to laugh.
63523,eng,Glasswork came from Persia by way of the Silk Road.
7196602,eng,I'm surprised that Tom gave Mary all the money she asked for.
6873774,eng,I must have lost my wallet in the supermarket.
1877138,eng,I was absolutely stunned.
6233383,eng,Do you still have a copy of yesterday's newspaper?
317265,eng,She fell in love with her friend's brother.
59287,eng,It is unlikely that this indictment will lead to his deportation.
7161278,eng,Sami took public transportation.
7276088,eng,Sami and Layla were still talking about that.
6658809,eng,"Tom is hardworking, but Mary isn't."
6125885,eng,Tom still has to pack his suitcase.
7401313,eng,"She likes to swim, doesn't she?"
7347971,eng,Sami converted to Islam when he was sixteen years old.
1754185,eng,We're going to lose him!
321826,eng,I'm left-handed.
302374,eng,He went to a college of agriculture.
3157462,eng,It's not me you have to convince.
3620292,eng,Tom leaned down and kissed Mary.
7144245,eng,I didn't think anyone was here yesterday.
7474429,eng,They say they only eat organic food.
1105323,eng,"Mr Briggs is not any doctor, he is an excellent surgeon."
6877068,eng,I wasn't right.
25669,eng,We found the beds quite comfortable.
4491433,eng,My father has a new car.
2541913,eng,I'm glad everything worked out.
2099963,eng,Even thin sheets of Americium-241 can sustain a chain reaction.
6413962,eng,Mary says she wants to do everything by herself.
5886630,eng,Muslims are portrayed in a different light by Western media.
7542005,eng,Tom carried Mary's suitcase to her room.
6518028,eng,I know what Tom and Mary want to do.
6496309,eng,Tom and Mary thought they could do that if they had some help.
316309,eng,She felt regret for having been rude to him.
7475582,eng,They say they intend to do that.
2843465,eng,"The earlier I go to bed, the earlier I get up."
5424324,eng,We aren't bluffing.
2452019,eng,It's thirty kilometers away.
7476591,eng,They put their helmets on.
50975,eng,"On arriving there, he went to see her."
5876323,eng,"Fadil decided that he wanted to raise his family in a different environment than Cairo, so they moved to Alexandria."
1836181,eng,Tom lives in a small town in the Bavarian Alps.
5936547,eng,"According to Tom, Mary got married last month."
5943565,eng,It would be a very nice gift!
1911927,eng,She's not my type.
3565531,eng,I don't know how Brazilians say 'aardvark' in their native tongue.
6678761,eng,You should've asked Tom for help.
5216285,eng,I'm ready to go back home.
7213519,eng,Layla took her panties off.
5836101,eng,I swear I can't believe what I'm doing.
2863178,eng,We gave up.
6431084,eng,Everyone needs to feel loved.
5203701,eng,I think both Tom and Mary are lying.
1095249,eng,Tom climbed up three flights of stairs.
1449410,eng,Bill can run the fastest in his class.
6884956,eng,Years spent playing in the percussion section took a toll on her hearing.
2643993,eng,Tom dropped his flashlight.
2705631,eng,It's easy for a slut to go from guy to another.
2549511,eng,I'm in the band.
3162152,eng,I can't help you with that.
6245171,eng,I hope Tom knows who has to do that.
7409028,eng,They wanted me to help them.
4496976,eng,Do you think you could talk Tom into joining our team?
7520285,eng,I know Tom intended to do that.
6309983,eng,His brother was the same way.
248877,eng,It is necessary that we provide for the future.
1500180,eng,This medicine has no harmful side effects.
6868287,eng,I should have never trusted Tom.
2644362,eng,Tom looks really familiar.
7382754,eng,He stared at himself in the mirror.
1435633,eng,Complete the sentence.
7303228,eng,There are many more questions.
5756853,eng,They make me laugh.
7271352,eng,Sami was just trying to do the right thing.
5116615,eng,Slow down! You're driving too fast!
6432935,eng,Tom is going to need to get used to doing that.
6618600,eng,"When the house is renovated and refurnished, all that he will need will be a wife to make it complete. Between ourselves, there are pretty clear signs that this will not be wanting if the lady is willing, for I have seldom seen a man more infatuated with a woman than he is with our beautiful neighbour, Miss Stapleton."
5725867,eng,We're looking at that possibility.
6356093,eng,What else did you make?
6496663,eng,I told Tom and Mary not to do that the way they were doing it.
7538292,eng,"Tom can feed himself, can't he?"
7159850,eng,I'll never go back to Australia.
277494,eng,China is twenty times as large as Japan.
2648018,eng,They laughed at me.
2255627,eng,He frequently neglects his work.
242480,eng,Where will you have lunch today?
6634440,eng,Stop bragging.
818455,eng,Three kings and two eights earned him a full house.
5758019,eng,Do you feel happy?
7521513,eng,I know Tom is a good cook.
5598674,eng,I hope Tom comes tomorrow.
4662766,eng,Tom didn't have to get up as early today as he usually does.
6890465,eng,Can you tuck me in?
6394389,eng,Sami doesn't deserve more than what I deserve from life.
7576932,eng,I haven't spoken to Tom about that.
1895693,eng,You said I was a liar.
7381372,eng,"Mary is swimming, isn't she?"
2917369,eng,The country demands social justice.
5828308,eng,Jamal? What is he doing here?
6706345,eng,Sami flipped the mattress.
5883172,eng,Fadil became the fifth man to divorce Layla.
3736169,eng,I've decided to stay in Boston for a few more days.
6647006,eng,Tom told me he thought Mary had been disrespectful.
7399049,eng,She knows that she has a problem.
5699740,eng,Tom and Mary couldn't be happier.
5753164,eng,"It's very cold in this room, isn't it?"
6524060,eng,I wonder whether or not Tom knows where my umbrella is.
6423654,eng,I let Mary talk me into helping her.
7219414,eng,Sami wanted to rephrase the sentence.
6577416,eng,I've gone lo-fi.
7248366,eng,Tom usually wears glasses only when he reads.
35948,eng,"You will have heard the news, I think?"
7236576,eng,I suspect Tom and Mary are wrong about that.
7150328,eng,Tom's parents live in Australia.
6665547,eng,I need a new pair of gloves.
251859,eng,My mother gets up early every morning.
6972587,eng,"Tom makes so many mistakes, but he has a big heart."
7735336,eng,I doubt if I'll get a chance to do that.
3737624,eng,Tom might be thirsty.
6945906,eng,I didn't like spinach when I was a kid.
7539964,eng,Tom showed Mary the letter that he got from John.
3329818,eng,Can't I please just go?
6581066,eng,Does she know that?
309730,eng,Her story can't be true.
5695028,eng,"I'd love to do that, but I'm too busy right now."
3378996,eng,It's necessary to wait just ten days.
54033,eng,"Sam is a philosopher, isn't he?"
1588719,eng,She likes to go to the library.
1025470,eng,Tom has a loud voice.
6772463,eng,I hope Tom doesn't waste our time.
310055,eng,She has been studying English since the age of ten.
277472,eng,Chinese food is no less delicious than French.
1676677,eng,This is a great theory.
3417510,eng,Tom went to Boston a year ago.
6225733,eng,Tom should be better at doing that than Mary is.
6499845,eng,"You know that Tom and Mary are the ones who did that, don't you?"
791733,eng,Every one of his songs was a hit.
5210240,eng,I really don't think I can do that.
622359,eng,"Go straight down the road, and when you pass the traffic light you're there."
6690472,eng,Tom often visits his aunt.
7120565,eng,There's something I've been meaning to ask you.
2342542,eng,Can someone explain this to me?
1886557,eng,Who's laughing?
6343596,eng,Tom said he didn't have one of these yet.
3154650,eng,Would you like me to get you something to eat?
6728530,eng,I didn't know that I wasn't supposed to do that by myself.
2045352,eng,It's like a bad dream.
7214283,eng,Tom told me that he was having fun.
6083573,eng,Layla was on death row.
3735212,eng,We still haven't decided what to do.
3819728,eng,I have two tickets.
2163143,eng,Something is making the door stick.
3455726,eng,I am a dog person.
7388585,eng,He hit the wall with his fist.
6526814,eng,"I didn't get the job, even though I was qualified."
5082848,eng,"Do you have your jumper on the wrong way around, Tom? - ""That may well be."""
7389269,eng,He's talking with his friends.
3409651,eng,This sentence is a lie.
7729402,eng,How about going to a movie tonight?
256629,eng,"I was told not go out, which advice I followed."
6102804,eng,Show the money.
1775320,eng,The history of the relationship between the Catholic Church and the Jews was not always a happy or an easy one. Too often it was written in tears.
4494961,eng,Tom was bewildered.
7185189,eng,Sami was asleep.
7474650,eng,They certainly think they're clever.
4501979,eng,You seem very happy this morning.
5851651,eng,I studied hard.
7512613,eng,I knew Tom wasn't going to do that tomorrow.
6530222,eng,Tom is waiting for you to leave.
2720501,eng,"Elaine of Corbenic, fell in love with Lancelot and tricked him into believing that she was Guinevere, so that he would sleep with her."
7391178,eng,He stretched out his legs.
6518203,eng,Tom and Mary explained why they did that.
7426641,eng,Teach me how to make a salad.
3071822,eng,Can we find anybody that knows this town?
5688263,eng,He'll freeze to death out here.
6130641,eng,Sami met Farid in jail.
5225053,eng,Tom said he has a lot of homework to do tonight.
6429187,eng,Mary put her cap back on.
7514846,eng,Tom thinks that what Mary did was wrong.
279389,eng,Please remember to mail this letter on your way to school.
2335915,eng,You can't really control who you'll fall in love with.
4502470,eng,Tom was suspended.
1690021,eng,This bird can fly.
497952,eng,The work should be ready tomorrow.
5857173,eng,I understood for the first time in my life what falling deeply in love was.
2239744,eng,Tom was bluffing.
4780804,eng,Neither Esperanto nor Interlingua employ double negative.
2081118,eng,What are you looking for in the darkroom?
5390328,eng,We haven't found him.
1619780,eng,Mary is anxious about the way she looks.
6665324,eng,"Tom wasn't able to do that, but Mary was."
280825,eng,Which is the heavier of the two?
60502,eng,Push the button here.
245812,eng,Children filled the room.
4156301,eng,The phone rang again.
1417118,eng,We must follow the regulations.
7494467,eng,Where did he end up going?
6650871,eng,Tom said that he'd do that by 2:30.
3396446,eng,Were you miserable?
7380901,eng,Mary can't breathe on her own.
262228,eng,I was a constant torment to my parents.
7380899,eng,Mary chews on her fingernails.
4609565,eng,I sell umbrellas.
2829502,eng,Everyone's got a reason to celebrate the beginning of the new year. They all survived the old one.
2554169,eng,"The problem is, he has no money."
6051636,eng,You are using the word incorrectly.
4494171,eng,The pain must be horrible.
2240173,eng,Tom wasn't moving.
1025328,eng,Tom has no one to turn to for help.
3168427,eng,Tom walked over to where Mary was seated.
57612,eng,Go straight ahead on this street.
3496395,eng,Tom was one of my best friends in high school.
25527,eng,Don't play hard to get with me.
3917810,eng,I baked some cookies for him.
3164452,eng,Tom advised me to keep it secret.
680652,eng,Tom will get a better job with a college degree.
7126924,eng,Let me tell you why I did that.
406018,eng,A cold rain fell over the city.
21260,eng,Do you play a musical instrument?
7514617,eng,I know that Tom isn't a native of Boston.
5425006,eng,When are you planning on getting married?
7084283,eng,"Please, who are you?"
7015293,eng,There should be some type of checks and balances.
7176000,eng,Tom thinks that that's good enough.
7734637,eng,Tom is already back home.
757092,eng,Double or quit?
5746202,eng,Thank you for your call.
7514249,eng,Everyone knows that Tom doesn't like Mary.
31673,eng,"Waiter, please bring me another glass of beer."
6502533,eng,Tom and Mary said they hoped that John would help them.
1843149,eng,"Muslims believe only in Allah as the unique God, and in Mohammad as the last prophet."
5848534,eng,I wish we had a candle or something.
2966923,eng,Are you a dog guy or a cat guy?
1028882,eng,Tom gave Mary an expensive doll.
3619388,eng,I'm not going to have any fun.
2700776,eng,She asked him out and he said yes.
30594,eng,"If it rains tomorrow, will you stay at home?"
3315154,eng,That would be a big help.
7399228,eng,He already knows what he'll do.
6575322,eng,I expect an apology.
6347745,eng,I knew Tom wouldn't get caught.
1028013,eng,Tom sometimes plays tennis with Mary.
7117947,eng,"You're not supposed to wear lipstick at school, are you?"
7171538,eng,I thought that you might like this book.
6238150,eng,I don't think Tom would care if I did that.
7543443,eng,Tom is on his way home from work.
2359590,eng,I've got a job interview.
290194,eng,He has to get up immediately.
2392577,eng,I remember seeing this before.
1343733,eng,I would love to go.
6088353,eng,Layla tried to remove the plywood board.
6665894,eng,"Tom isn't up, but Mary is."
6676289,eng,I suspect that Tom and Mary have to go to Boston.
3823700,eng,Tom had to wait three hours.
4663372,eng,Maintaining friendships can be challenging.
53822,eng,Jane is no less beautiful than her mother.
6235460,eng,I don't make enough money to support my family.
2765259,eng,May I borrow a pen?
1140121,eng,I'd like to thank you for coming today.
6048414,eng,Tom was there when his mother killed herself.
6254265,eng,You'll get the chance to do that.
6310205,eng,"On the extreme verge of the horizon lie a long chain of mountain peaks, with their rugged summits flecked with snow."
270829,eng,Water becomes solid when it freezes.
1109950,eng,I'll fill you in later.
5852424,eng,I began to run.
6426803,eng,Mary gave all her money to Tom.
5051989,eng,They use this book in Spanish class.
6434839,eng,Tom was here on the evening of the 20th.
6118559,eng,It may be more difficult to do than you think it'll be.
2541274,eng,That strike lasted three months.
7021408,eng,You'd better start at once.
446114,eng,"What with the wind and the rain, our walk was spoiled."
5936842,eng,I never told anyone about what happened.
6096746,eng,Do you know where all these cars came from?
7231585,eng,I don't think that I was disobedient.
3915305,eng,Why didn't someone help her?
3904907,eng,You're upsetting her.
3123068,eng,Tom looks pretty shaken up.
19276,eng,How long does it take to get to the stadium?
6818721,eng,Sami's dog is so ugly.
6240013,eng,I should've helped Tom with his homework.
3915137,eng,You have to help them.
975244,eng,Writing is a deeper sleep than death.
4808467,eng,My brother sends you his warm regards.
3312417,eng,We have no idea what's going on.
5733045,eng,I know we'll give it our best.
4012868,eng,How did Tom react to that?
367945,eng,I am vegan.
5360738,eng,She never lets her beliefs get in the way of her duty.
6227677,eng,I wonder if Tom is satisfied.
3417014,eng,"Tom is quite patient, isn't he?"
2360397,eng,I have things on my mind.
2043633,eng,"Humans are supposedly rational animals, but make most decisions based on gut feeling."
7439404,eng,They said that they felt no pressure.
894946,eng,"If you drive a car like that, you'll end up in the hospital."
5745179,eng,I don't know your habits.
2011725,eng,Who wants to kill you?
6767391,eng,This isn't Tom's office.
315122,eng,She was ill with heart disease.
7242210,eng,Sami was trying to keep his composure.
266472,eng,The housing project has fallen flat.
5869335,eng,Fadil picked up a few items and hit the road.
887604,eng,She wouldn't speak to him.
7390101,eng,She needed to wash her car.
1726878,eng,The children caught butterflies.
7134733,eng,I think that Tom may have been intoxicated.
7474236,eng,They hoped they wouldn't be too late.
300795,eng,He is afraid of his grandfather.
5310009,eng,Tom has never called me.
6248491,eng,You're a bit taller than Tom is.
7398954,eng,He only does what he has to do.
6682848,eng,We need to help more people today more than ever.
6230135,eng,I think Tom had to do that.
2953189,eng,Lots of girls like Tom.
2541229,eng,Tom is waiting for you and Mary.
57073,eng,The last chapter of this book.
3917855,eng,I want what's best for him.
6505767,eng,I don't know what Tom and Mary think I should do.
3731052,eng,Do you want to get back together with Tom?
318928,eng,My father is proud of my being handsome.
7163852,eng,I wanted to stay in Australia.
3426221,eng,Tom didn't intend to let Mary drive.
506948,eng,Do you smoke?
6799129,eng,Don't leave without us.
5023337,eng,"Are you hungry? ""I'm not hungry. When I was at school, I ate a sandwich."""
7473609,eng,They had bruises all over their bodies.
708911,eng,They're really good at making clothes.
6529292,eng,I think Tom didn't see me yesterday.
6528537,eng,Tom and Mary adopted a girl from China.
6226047,eng,There's no need to worry about that happening.
5505644,eng,Here is my membership card.
3259279,eng,I know a place that is very pleasant.
6898290,eng,"You aren't depressed, are you?"
3201756,eng,Can't you tell me how to do this?
6086393,eng,Sami promised to marry Layla.
6614582,eng,"I hope you don't mind. ""Not at all."""
6514229,eng,Have Tom and Mary told you anything yet?
2259955,eng,You very nearly guessed it.
4405075,eng,I don't like working on weekends.
52629,eng,John is likely to make a mistake.
322748,eng,I'm very pleased that your dream came true.
5834886,eng,Tom promised he'd never hit me again.
6529956,eng,Tom is likely to leave next week.
6170127,eng,This must always be here; this is the place for it. Have you understood it?
25185,eng,Give me something to drink.
3820020,eng,I'm not leaving Tom and Mary here by themselves.
5000284,eng,We can call for free on the weekend.
7197317,eng,It isn't too deep.
6424486,eng,Mary told me she had to stay home.
7376598,eng,"Mary is never going to quit, is she?"
5817970,eng,"I wasn't going to sing that song, but Tom asked me to, so I did."
6440397,eng,Tom is still snoring.
6526862,eng,"Tom invited us to his party, but we're not going."
6315591,eng,He took the package to the post office.
7421711,eng,Tom and Mary had the time of their life in Japan.
5877756,eng,"As an extra precaution, Fadil installed surveillance cameras outside his house."
6900882,eng,"Tom is thickheaded, isn't he?"
6530774,eng,Tom is excited to get started.
3235332,eng,Martin Scorsese is my favorite film director.
1975695,eng,I haven't actually shot anyone yet.
6044161,eng,Layla's death was a mystery.
298447,eng,He intends to devote his life to curing the sick in India.
3330920,eng,You just screwed up.
6735997,eng,She's obviously lying!
4512559,eng,She lived in a nice home in a nice neighborhood.
31764,eng,Mary can dance well.
3408663,eng,It was Tom's idea to do this.
5157693,eng,Is it Friday?
1512860,eng,Those flowers are very beautiful!
281886,eng,I'd like to have a test for breast cancer.
7184061,eng,I doubt very seriously Tom will be nervous.
566095,eng,The death penalty is final and irreversible.
5829185,eng,I set a trap.
3906506,eng,I'll never talk to him again.
6517852,eng,I wonder why Tom and Mary are naked.
1742197,eng,"Whose documents are these? ""They are Michael's."""
5850547,eng,I slept for three hours.
1080163,eng,He came just after you left.
6530407,eng,Tom wanted to pay off his loan.
6243784,eng,Do you have any idea what we need to do?
2655575,eng,"Skillful listening is the best remedy for loneliness, loquaciousness, and laryngitis."
2273808,eng,We don't always agree.
823000,eng,He stepped into my space.
6506720,eng,Why didn't you tell me Tom and Mary were ready?
4014433,eng,Are you sure you won't come with me?
7235550,eng,I don't think that being poor is anything to be ashamed of.
7317294,eng,Sami apologized to his viewers.
6630947,eng,Keep stirring.
2795285,eng,"The four seasons of the year are spring, summer, autumn, and winter."
2281832,eng,Why didn't Tom say anything?
1761890,eng,Are there still wild bears in Germany?
2360099,eng,I've never seen you cry.
2538079,eng,I'm sure Tom would've told me if he'd known.
7539004,eng,Tom asked the taxi driver to drive him to the nearest bank.
5699120,eng,I've got some gasoline right here.
884225,eng,Dima is one badass dude.
7438261,eng,They said that they've seen people do that.
2082836,eng,The name of the cybertherapist is Eliza.
6659659,eng,I had a very important decision to make.
2014351,eng,"Look, I don't want any trouble."
7539568,eng,Tom is going to go sailing with Mary this afternoon.
1136796,eng,Is there anyone you can trust in this cold place?
353192,eng,No place like home.
307622,eng,They arrived there before dawn.
7501239,eng,I knew Tom was a pretty good carpenter. That's why I asked him to help me.
2706406,eng,Can I get a goodnight kiss?
3022490,eng,Let's stop at the next service station.
6337344,eng,I wonder if Tom told Mary she shouldn't leave early.
843931,eng,I had a breakdown.
5737674,eng,We put everything together.
6517169,eng,Tom and Mary let themselves in with a key.
2646527,eng,That was embarrassing.
3315225,eng,Is this a big deal?
3603336,eng,The fact that it's expensive doesn't mean that it's any good.
5351399,eng,Tom is a compulsive hoarder.
5124788,eng,Tom made a day trip.
2646317,eng,Tom seems pretty busy.
40144,eng,It is just half past seven.
6513892,eng,Tom and Mary said that they were unconvinced.
7193914,eng,It is obvious that is a lie.
7539504,eng,Neither Tom nor Mary has been waiting here very long.
1816708,eng,Do you love me just because I have black hair?
2203223,eng,We're prepared.
3393221,eng,Could we leave now?
5852568,eng,I stayed there for three hours.
7218375,eng,Tom told me that he thought that Mary was thrilled.
7167768,eng,Both Tom and I grew up in Australia.
2012472,eng,I want to write this down.
812690,eng,This befits you.
805339,eng,The soldiers could see him now.
6249625,eng,I'll do that at least one more time.
6260503,eng,Tom says he needs more than that.
5132104,eng,This tree will never blossom.
6715715,eng,Sami believed Layla was having an affair with Farid.
6260762,eng,I should've called the police.
6890593,eng,Mary drove her motorcycle back and forth over Tom's painted miniatures.
627397,eng,You are my obsession.
5353113,eng,Those who talk a lot often lose their voices.
3822706,eng,Get your paws off of me.
3151143,eng,Would you give it a rest?
6243991,eng,You should've done that somewhere else.
5879374,eng,"Sometimes, your worst enemy is sleeping right next to you and you don't realize it."
6498501,eng,Tom and Mary wouldn't drink the coffee John made for them.
3915542,eng,I didn't even hear them.
6840451,eng,"What is she? - ""She's a teacher."""
7171759,eng,I thought you said that you wanted Tom to do that with you.
7191167,eng,I told Tom I thought you were in Australia.
3728109,eng,Let's not pack our bags just yet.
3417245,eng,"Tom is being very cynical, isn't he?"
3918682,eng,What made you contact us?
3030928,eng,We're snowed under by invitations.
7148974,eng,Sami was expecting Layla to do something.
5422563,eng,"There will be live music at the picnic. ""What kind of music?"""
7177462,eng,Tom said that Mary was lying.
2502974,eng,This is not a book for children.
2095670,eng,A few people (I'm not telling who) have not cleaned up the room.
3825222,eng,Tom could never make me laugh the way you do.
4597532,eng,What are the differences between African and Asian elephants?
6649821,eng,Tom said that he hoped Mary would be allowed to do that.
7274994,eng,Sami never communicated with Layla.
2891460,eng,Is there somewhere we can go?
1140152,eng,I suggest we swim across the river.
2640359,eng,Tom and Mary were surprised by what they saw.
2891715,eng,Maybe you can help.
260356,eng,I must go and see him.
1343972,eng,She enjoys going clubbing with her friends.
1932073,eng,He's no saint.
6265737,eng,This report has many typos.
3178506,eng,This is probably for you.
6247771,eng,Tom demonstrated how the device worked.
7732611,eng,We have more important matters to discuss right now.
6229263,eng,You're the only one who won't be at the meeting tomorrow.
1521,eng,Please don't cry.
6406511,eng,Mary said she doesn't plan on doing that here.
6211756,eng,"However, he did not cease from continuing his way; a young prince in search of glory is ever valiant."
6440747,eng,My life isn’t your problem.
6432578,eng,Why don't you get Tom to teach you how to drive?
6415041,eng,I didn't really think Mary did that by herself.
73447,eng,We have a lot of very fine days in October.
5074837,eng,I find your work very impressive.
3917289,eng,I polished your shoes for you.
6235236,eng,Tom and I talked for quite a while this afternoon.
253157,eng,I always have to give in to him.
7391095,eng,He started packing his backpack.
3413099,eng,Tom snuck out of the office.
52270,eng,I heard a faint sound nearby.
4496419,eng,Things can change quickly.
6353837,eng,Tom probably shouldn't tell Mary why he did that.
3181961,eng,Did you have a chance to talk to Tom?
287271,eng,You will be very pleased by how he performs.
2401249,eng,We didn't need to do that.
7397523,eng,She said she didn't smoke anymore.
6254963,eng,Tom's last year in Boston was 2013.
3735825,eng,I didn't open any of the boxes.
7476885,eng,Tom is wearing a blue hat.
6507292,eng,I didn't know Tom and Mary were born in Boston.
2235801,eng,I'm Tom's wife.
5937796,eng,He was a great president.
7441280,eng,"They aren't the ones, are they?"
7473786,eng,They say that they'll keep doing that.
3251269,eng,"Mary was pleasantly surprised, when she got home from work, to find that Tom had already prepared the evening meal."
7237095,eng,Sami is gonna be poor.
4430026,eng,From which Surah is this Ayah from?
3408865,eng,I can teach you how to do that.
5506606,eng,I don't think it's fair that you pick me over her!
7142972,eng,I didn't think you were wrong.
3928154,eng,The security chief monitored the site looking for weak spots.
3329524,eng,Tom's teacher wished him the best of luck in whatever he chose to do after leaving school.
5741678,eng,How were the teams chosen?
7246883,eng,Layla was messing up people's nails.
2663534,eng,I had the same problems.
7401188,eng,He said he didn't feel tired.
6393327,eng,Sami thinks I'm having his baby.
6524899,eng,Both Tom and Mary were dirty.
6738102,eng,I did that earlier this week.
5747043,eng,Tom confirmed the report.
1446014,eng,An increasingly greater part of the population is not capable of fully utilizing the power of expression of the German language.
6498128,eng,Tom and Mary said they thought I might not want to do that.
328521,eng,"All hands, abandon ship!"
1838037,eng,He's a gambler.
6954704,eng,It's right up your geek alley.
253110,eng,Eleven o'clock is my regular time for going to bed.
2633511,eng,It's my favorite dish!
7406533,eng,They've decided to sell their car.
3732678,eng,Tom never told me he wanted to go to Harvard.
6251956,eng,I didn't know that Tom and Mary were dating each other until John told me.
33340,eng,Almost all the students know about it.
260595,eng,"While he was talking, I guess I was absent-minded."
3668961,eng,Do it this way!
2644639,eng,You have my full support.
55814,eng,"This wasn't cheap, was it?"
237678,eng,I'll sue you.
7377777,eng,Mary behaved as if she were insane.
5915297,eng,I made myself as comfortable as I could.
3636516,eng,Could you please hurry?
6542774,eng,Everyone in my family can play a musical instrument.
3533817,eng,Tom told the judge that he was innocent.
2954919,eng,You're an attractive woman.
7126661,eng,How can it have come to this?
6869822,eng,"You're not suggesting Tom could have done that, are you?"
3622369,eng,I can speak Irish with reasonable fluency.
901962,eng,"Not that he couldn't, but he's too lazy a man to do it."
6515270,eng,Tom and Mary didn't believe what they heard.
7429306,eng,Things went well.
314284,eng,She's my type.
5835823,eng,I've probably got an ulcer.
3113552,eng,He has a huge feather.
3012439,eng,I didn't see where the ball went after it hit the tree.
4980179,eng,I wanted to make sure.
690964,eng,Happiness is not achieved by the conscious pursuit of happiness; it is generally the by-product of other activities.
5849723,eng,Tom told Mary not to talk to John.
6235988,eng,My truck was slightly damaged in the accident.
1961855,eng,I thought your parents liked me.
3891109,eng,We were in very big trouble.
6271392,eng,Just do that right now.
2006471,eng,I asked her out.
6265145,eng,I did that just a while ago.
6337303,eng,I wonder whether I really could do that.
2301426,eng,"As the trees crave tranquility in the ever-persistent wind, the child craves the care of its ever-absent parents."
1126653,eng,Excite the mind: words.
7375177,eng,Mary wants to start her own business.
7504344,eng,I knew that Tom would be a difficult person to deal with.
7149470,eng,"Sami seemed very, very sincere."
6118309,eng,I think that something bad is about to happen.
4777056,eng,I ate bhel.
7165593,eng,Sami needed a logical explanation.
3384876,eng,What was Tom's last name?
7399514,eng,She thinks that she's so clever.
3154793,eng,No one is asking you to eat that.
6335125,eng,Tom said Mary was planning to go surfing.
2266922,eng,I didn't know that your mother lived with you.
7396343,eng,He knows exactly what he's doing.
6527986,eng,I think Tom didn't have to leave so early.
6398045,eng,A crocodile bit off his leg.
6447756,eng,Sami is here in Egypt.
5747041,eng,Why are you encouraged?
249980,eng,I need his power.
6867320,eng,Sami looked at me.
7503962,eng,"I knew Tom was still sitting in his car, waiting for Mary."
7236655,eng,I suspected Tom was lying about that.
28887,eng,Don't mention our plan to anybody.
5573994,eng,Tom sure talks a lot.
3824279,eng,They're all good guys.
3310007,eng,We've got to find them.
4662861,eng,Tom got out of the shower and put his clothes back on.
3402412,eng,Tom is just trying to scare you.
5157668,eng,Marie prepared her own meal.
284726,eng,"He made a careless mistake, as is often the case with him."
4408795,eng,"Masha dreams of starting a revolution, but is quite afraid."
6492530,eng,I think Tom and Mary wouldn't be forgiven for doing that if they weren't so young.
7035427,eng,Wildlife has prospered here.
2539480,eng,I'm going to have dinner with my son.
254449,eng,I was able to answer the question.
6502375,eng,Tom and Mary said they'd buy something for John to eat.
70255,eng,You can hear the news on the radio at nine o'clock.
5953548,eng,My leg is fine now.
6517633,eng,Tom and Mary are waiting for dinner.
251088,eng,My car needs repairing.
261739,eng,I could do nothing but stare stupidly at the printed page.
3256317,eng,"Tomorrow, it will be cold."
300774,eng,He went heart and soul into the work.
3823653,eng,I won't make you hurry.
51259,eng,Yup! I'm going to give up cigarettes.
6588570,eng,The jack of diamonds.
2644527,eng,"Look, Tom, we have to move."
16514,eng,You must give up smoking.
3567372,eng,The rumor is true.
6422232,eng,Mary told Tom she could eat anything.
5836207,eng,All stolen cars end up here.
6116855,eng,I've been looking for my tripod.
6419571,eng,Mary doesn't want Tom to do that for her.
7110526,eng,I'll go tell them that we're ready.
6335804,eng,"If anyone can do that, it's you."
2012986,eng,I want to make some changes.
6343259,eng,"Tom didn't seem to be very hungry, did he?"
1461840,eng,Let's do this again.
1950790,eng,Tom can't believe how happy Mary seems to be.
7182736,eng,Tom said he didn't think actually happened.
2882331,eng,I'm sure she loves me.
7386956,eng,She asked me to polish her shoes.
2311245,eng,It's a form of rebellion.
238572,eng,The decision rests with him.
5849354,eng,Tom doesn't like to watch baseball.
5611664,eng,Can you abstain from smoking for a week?
6019958,eng,Mary used a flat iron to straighten her hair.
6425791,eng,Mary told me that she was ready.
6413204,eng,Mary told Tom that she was in Boston last Monday.
3921453,eng,I heard Tom and Mary talking about John.
6664940,eng,Tom got famous.
5847097,eng,I started to read my new book.
242164,eng,I brought a jacket because it was quite cool this morning.
54825,eng,The concert was held over till the following week because of the singer's illness.
6927817,eng,Did you know Tom wanted to become a carpenter?
7152402,eng,Tom told Mary he wasn't planning on staying in Australia very long.
2096996,eng,He can run 100 meters in less than twelve seconds.
5075240,eng,Tom admitted that he wears fake glasses because he wants to look smarter.
7375640,eng,"Mary is trying to do that, isn't she?"
7395551,eng,"He seems quite happy, doesn't he?"
7518440,eng,I know Tom is a very stingy person.
7511659,eng,I know Tom wanted be the next one to do that.
954536,eng,What does this paragraph mean?
4861651,eng,Tom leaned back in his swivel chair.
1556829,eng,I'll call back soon.
5452124,eng,"At least four were killed in the explosion of a car bomb outside a police station in the capital, Nairobi."
667914,eng,I have never let my schooling interfere with my education.
2692850,eng,"The older I become, the less I understand."
6237783,eng,"You haven't finish doing that yet, have you?"
3918820,eng,There's no way I can catch her.
6661372,eng,Please do me a favor and just leave.
6117941,eng,You should do that while you still can.
1895793,eng,You can't hurt me.
2091182,eng,No one will know I'm here.
2640596,eng,Tom was sitting three tables away from us.
3254134,eng,He's a weirdo.
267237,eng,The girls amused themselves playing games.
6351000,eng,Where did you study yesterday?
7407293,eng,They dented their car.
6108541,eng,When do you think you're going to get here?
807277,eng,Thousands of people lost their jobs.
62655,eng,"The cakes were still warm, and they all ate and drank."
1939395,eng,I would like a tourist visa.
5871931,eng,Fadil was waiting for Layla in the parking lot.
3906324,eng,I tried to talk to her.
3903281,eng,I had a talk with her.
6254245,eng,Tom said Mary knew she might not have to do that by herself.
6090140,eng,Layla rebelled against authority.
253668,eng,I am as sad and lonely as can be.
2609532,eng,I had a leg cramp when swimming.
2641059,eng,"You know Tom won't do that, don't you?"
6220057,eng,Tom got jealous.
57072,eng,The hero of the book rails at the injustices of the world but does nothing about them.
942478,eng,"Today, the weather is very nice."
6089421,eng,Guess who's coming for dinner tonight.
6108284,eng,I couldn't contain my excitement.
5958482,eng,I continued texting.
5986853,eng,Mary made a cloth doll.
6896453,eng,Ask Tom where he went last Monday.
2276027,eng,I don't have a weapon.
5753472,eng,Closing is an option.
7213578,eng,Sami worked at that company for six years.
2033804,eng,I thought you didn't want to talk about this.
6426055,eng,Mary said she isn't ready to go.
6220341,eng,Tom said he's not happy.
2360822,eng,I heard you talking to Tom.
907454,eng,It takes a wise man to discover a wise man.
2646402,eng,Tom is a photographer.
3650951,eng,It was morning. There was the smell of coffee and the ground was covered with frost.
1849015,eng,He climbed El Capitan.
1334715,eng,I totally agree with his definition of friendship.
3819466,eng,"I have to be very careful, Tom."
315248,eng,Is she making a doll?
6513608,eng,Tom and Mary say they won't be here tomorrow.
5921280,eng,Sami had a history of depression.
4017460,eng,I think that I'll be in Boston by 2:30.
6348907,eng,Tom isn't likely to start crying.
2900528,eng,Please give me some analgesic.
3818292,eng,I'm not sleepy yet.
2245639,eng,I can cook.
7179089,eng,Tom said that Mary didn't look much like her mother.
6502494,eng,What color shirts were Tom and Mary wearing yesterday?
6493216,eng,Tom and Mary knew they didn't have enough time to do what had to be done.
5851594,eng,How did you do that without any help?
241723,eng,Never forget that you owe what you are to your parents.
306317,eng,Learning runs in their blood.
6245515,eng,You're the one who told us to do that.
7194239,eng,I didn't know Tom would be in Australia this week.
6381644,eng,The fire is getting worse.
7517557,eng,Tom really thought I had to do that.
6418397,eng,Mary says she's had three glasses of wine.
6711566,eng,Sami's kindness won't be repaid.
7739017,eng,Sami's grandfather has just passed away.
4529008,eng,We have three adopted children and two biological children.
2457476,eng,"The first person to talk to me, when I had just switched schools and had no friends, was Tom."
7246186,eng,Sami searched everywhere.
2956182,eng,Tom called off his trip.
1118738,eng,"I've tried it for a few days, and I'm pretty sure you won't love it."
5037349,eng,Gonzalez's first double fault came at the most inopportune moment when he was down a set point.
5910043,eng,Are you also able to speak French?
6020418,eng,What the hell is wrong with you people?
2548089,eng,Tom needs your help.
59924,eng,This theory consists of three parts.
2258140,eng,Can you light the way?
6235005,eng,Tom moved to Boston with his wife just last month.
4013125,eng,I think we need to have a talk.
4959398,eng,Do you know who Tom killed?
7109352,eng,He is smelting copper.
274110,eng,Mutual understanding promotes peace.
2990859,eng,"If you know Spanish well, you'll have no problems with looking for a job. But some with finding one."
6593201,eng,Sami wanted to do Layla harm.
2236206,eng,Tom didn't ask.
3921298,eng,I should probably spend more time with Tom.
6347941,eng,I want to know who didn't do that.
4496897,eng,"Hopefully, that can continue."
3329720,eng,Can I borrow your handkerchief?
270255,eng,"Man is but a reed, the weakest in nature, but he is a thinking reed."
6605811,eng,"While the revellers stood aghast at the fury of the man, one more wicked or, it may be, more drunken than the rest, cried out that they should put the hounds upon her."
2273766,eng,We will not surrender.
1029988,eng,Tom admitted that what Mary said was true.
5179237,eng,Let's go to a Japanese restaurant.
4537008,eng,Mary's realisation that she was gay plunged her into a reactive depression.
7356812,eng,It's the perfect place for a romantic evening.
3593995,eng,That looks like tea.
7627780,eng,The capital of Algeria is Algiers.
7732458,eng,Tom is pretty sure he saw a wolf.
6345622,eng,I hope Tom didn't have to do that.
4502029,eng,Tom seemed better.
6870157,eng,We could have had some fun together.
6728609,eng,I didn't realize you should do that.
6243968,eng,I was there at the same time Tom was.
7733875,eng,We close at 6:30.
451399,eng,I think it says something about human nature that the only form of life we have created so far is purely destructive.
6244588,eng,Do you think Tom was able to do that?
6415680,eng,Mary forgot to do what she was supposed to do.
5075496,eng,She went to school by car.
7172778,eng,I thought that Tom was careless.
860097,eng,He was deathly afraid of Barbies.
6494848,eng,Tom and Mary didn't know that I was supposed to help them do that.
7253753,eng,Sami was talking about Layla in the video.
290424,eng,He observed many types of creatures there.
6652179,eng,Tom said that he wanted to do more.
5734974,eng,Tom needs a new dermatologist.
4343230,eng,There is no logical reason for this.
6898872,eng,"Tom is invited, isn't he?"
6427459,eng,Why did Mary do what she did?
5850444,eng,How else can we feed our families?
7435461,eng,Tom's father is very rich.
290380,eng,He always takes his time in everything that he does.
6228521,eng,"If Tom did that yesterday, he probably won't do it again today."
61095,eng,I have heard this proverb used.
3910697,eng,I managed to save them.
5425618,eng,Tom has gone on dates with both Mary and Alice.
1832735,eng,He's too old.
6710174,eng,Sami was asthmatic.
3822270,eng,I'd like some more.
1824439,eng,That is sensitive apparatus.
273282,eng,War compelled soldiers to go to the front.
5790507,eng,Watch that they don't fall on the rocks.
3910752,eng,You've got to respect them.
7222515,eng,I hope your parents will allow us to get married.
7191243,eng,I thought Tom would be returning to Australia.
2208761,eng,Tom wasn't about to leave Mary alone with John.
4235518,eng,They are treating me like a child.
5732837,eng,Let's hope that changes today.
2325159,eng,I eat there every night.
18781,eng,I would like to call on you one of these days.
6527401,eng,Tom is approximately the same height as Mary.
2985633,eng,"If you say that to Tom, you'll run the risk of losing your job."
6793244,eng,How much did Tom tell you?
26504,eng,"Since it's cloudy with a chance of rain today, we shouldn't go surfing."
1824576,eng,I learn new things every day.
3171059,eng,Mary broke up with me.
3181847,eng,Tom and I have to talk right now.
67244,eng,The best way to know what a country is like is to go and see it with your own eyes.
1065022,eng,Where's the nearest bus stop?
317022,eng,She calls me Kenji.
7180933,eng,I have a feeling you're going to like Australia.
6105944,eng,Tom wants you to leave.
4700049,eng,Tom is unlikely to want to go.
5852901,eng,I wasn't hurt.
6428951,eng,Mary let me drive her car.
2541602,eng,You won't believe what I heard.
3729170,eng,"If anything happens to Tom, I'll come looking for you."
7259921,eng,Sami is an Amazon junkie.
296727,eng,He is well off nowadays.
297179,eng,He served as mayor.
3287037,eng,I need to figure something out.
60330,eng,Must I take this lesson?
6230036,eng,The number of tourists we get every year has increased.
412412,eng,A danger foreseen is a danger avoided.
316526,eng,She called her bear Ted.
1305667,eng,I must go to work early today.
5915737,eng,It looks like Tom is enjoying himself.
7506987,eng,Do you think you'd be able to do that by yourselves?
274173,eng,See that the window is closed.
6491325,eng,It looks like Tom and Mary have already done that.
5788769,eng,I was hoping Tom would go home.
1026150,eng,Tom doesn't have anything in his bag.
5659078,eng,I'll do what the boss tells me.
7406694,eng,They pretended they were doctors.
6647335,eng,Tom told everybody that he was ready.
6091977,eng,Has Tom ever done that?
2737493,eng,Did he write it with a pencil?
2646178,eng,Who are they fighting?
3492732,eng,"There's a rumor going around that Tom likes Mary. ""I find that hard to believe."""
6412642,eng,Mary says she thinks it's not possible to do that.
7279130,eng,Sami threw away everything else that Layla had given him.
5807430,eng,It's been a long time since I've sung that song.
5207745,eng,Tom is partially paralyzed.
7513236,eng,I know Tom is used to sitting on the floor.
249424,eng,We are going on a school trip to Osaka Castle tomorrow.
7152298,eng,Tom told me that he didn't want to live in Australia.
6922435,eng,It'll be impossible for us to do that.
1867934,eng,Tom says he doesn't want a girlfriend.
7184091,eng,I doubt very seriously Tom will be cold.
255571,eng,I have a pen.
1768859,eng,I'll rip your head off!
263589,eng,I'll take some X-rays of your teeth.
1943870,eng,Stop. You're hurting me.
7507104,eng,Tom didn't tell anybody why they needed to do that.
3130225,eng,Tom has been interviewing people for that job all day.
6124128,eng,Tom isn't going to do that until Monday.
6630509,eng,"Thank you for fucking up this planet. Sincerely, the rest of us."
3754639,eng,"The walls of the palace were formed of drifted snow, and the windows and doors of the cutting winds."
3286977,eng,There's nothing I can do here.
6647606,eng,Tom sent a text message to Mary.
6150582,eng,"You don't even know his name, right?"
7240425,eng,I know you weren't lying.
3172183,eng,Get me a beer.
6415550,eng,Mary probably doesn't know she should do that.
6428711,eng,Mary gave Tom her notebook.
7401767,eng,She sold everything she owned.
5130134,eng,Tom has gone away for a weekend.
6866260,eng,I actually think that I might be able to do that.
7117657,eng,Tom was afraid for his life.
4012470,eng,Aren't you going to work today?
6542655,eng,That was kind of embarrassing.
7509044,eng,Tom didn't know the police were looking for him.
6341392,eng,There's little chance that Tom will win.
6717819,eng,Sami slipped and fell.
7393916,eng,She told me that she plans on going.
7474156,eng,They said they don't plan to do that.
1751428,eng,He knows how to connect his computer to the Internet.
7161272,eng,Sami spent the obly money he got on pizza.
3036028,eng,Which book are you reading?
3544276,eng,Tom washed his face and hands.
4708936,eng,How about tomorrow night at nine?
251712,eng,"By the time my father retires, he will have worked for almost thirty years."
2647454,eng,Tom made Mary laugh.
21490,eng,I like summer holidays better than school.
6698739,eng,I want to learn how to play chess.
6529358,eng,Tom wanted to get home before dark.
6399869,eng,Another cloud like a sheep.
319702,eng,There was not a breath of air.
6357407,eng,Tom said Mary probably won't cry.
6031306,eng,The French Intelligence experiences ups and downs.
6359955,eng,Sami and Layla started dating seriously.
7390248,eng,He often screens his calls.
4496939,eng,I hate your cooking.
302705,eng,He acquainted her with his plan.
6356625,eng,Let me do that myself.
4853342,eng,It was a delightful evening.
6654436,eng,Tom said that he didn't want a sandwich.
876368,eng,This classroom is separated from that one by a wall.
1887934,eng,I was on the list.
1737270,eng,When are you going back to your own country?
1064145,eng,There must be some sort of give-and-take.
6495831,eng,Tom and Mary told John that they thought Alice was unconscious.
5774064,eng,I told Tom that I was hungry.
7172882,eng,I thought that Tom was in school.
5936754,eng,Would you mind if I asked you a question?
6787906,eng,We couldn't sleep tranquilly.
6421284,eng,I'll help Mary do what she needs to do.
5128483,eng,Let's eat grandma!
6251298,eng,I helped Tom escape from jail.
1463060,eng,That should do it.
1972623,eng,Enjoy it while you can.
2865066,eng,We heard that.
2654908,eng,Does Emily have a dictionary?
2111302,eng,They're escaping.
6579197,eng,"Sorry, I misunderstood you."
6507878,eng,Tom and Mary aren't going to let me sing with them.
690152,eng,Then I can still have five more minutes of sleep.
5332073,eng,Tom got all the vegetables that Mary needs to prepare lunch from the garden.
6116226,eng,Quit.
2208752,eng,"Tom, I want you to know that you're not alone."
321281,eng,Did you enjoy staying in Hokkaido?
6675874,eng,I suspect that Tom is homeless.
6269366,eng,I looked under the table.
3010387,eng,He wasn't interested.
5906524,eng,Look at what's happening outside.
6248247,eng,I don't agree with what Tom said.
5161526,eng,How do you avoid snacking between meals?
7120585,eng,There were some beautiful women at the club last night.
5226920,eng,Try thinking about something else.
6226731,eng,Tom told Mary that she should quit pretending to be afraid.
6227007,eng,Tom told Mary that he didn't think John was glad that that was going to happen.
4499962,eng,I still write songs.
3905784,eng,I'm writing to them.
6490898,eng,Tom and Mary knew why nobody liked them.
2202686,eng,We're contented.
328338,eng,Please don't do translations if you're crap at it. This is a plea from the English translation clients.
6420965,eng,Mary said her new house cost her a lot.
6272281,eng,Tom didn't think Mary was scared.
7393939,eng,He told me that he had a headache.
6691561,eng,Sami fell in the bathroom and hit his head.
7299497,eng,Sami saw a tall guy standing behind Layla.
7243875,eng,Sami let Layla know what he put in the suitcase.
5325030,eng,That is an adjective.
3731188,eng,Do I detect sarcasm?
749352,eng,"He, most likely, seriously studied English."
7142978,eng,I didn't think you were the kind of person who would do that.
5670481,eng,I think that's a great question.
5839562,eng,Fadil is on the run.
7516717,eng,I know Tom doesn't know Mary did that.
6995595,eng,Are you saying I'm stupid?
322494,eng,The curtain raised on a noisy cocktail party.
6274241,eng,Please do that now.
7527008,eng,"According to a University of Minnesota study published earlier this year, 18 million reproductive-age women live in America’s rural counties, but over half of these counties have no hospital where a woman can give birth."
2474314,eng,"When I pressed the button, the bell rang."
3822682,eng,Someone else was with me.
2308265,eng,I couldn't possibly eat another bite.
2859186,eng,She helped Tom.
6503137,eng,Tom and Mary are going to eat as soon as they get home.
4016169,eng,Do you remember what to do?
1184646,eng,There's a fountain in front of the station.
6523989,eng,I wonder whether or not Tom thinks we have to do that.
289802,eng,He took a picture of the koala.
6330571,eng,Tom is an experienced painter.
299825,eng,He came downstairs out of the bedroom for breakfast.
50376,eng,He was always drinking in those days.
7537937,eng,Tell me everything Tom told you.
30883,eng,Were you to know the fact you would be surprised.
6123917,eng,Tom should've helped Mary.
6433410,eng,Tom is likely going to want to do that again.
307703,eng,They're eating high on the hog.
3890635,eng,We took pictures of the dolphins.
5069697,eng,Each student uses their own computer.
5848865,eng,I thought it might be fun to do that.
2496832,eng,We missed you last night.
7117406,eng,Tom vanished into thin air.
3766074,eng,How happy are you?
1727924,eng,"I am treating a patient, the doctor said."
6947031,eng,"I like swimming, but my mother doesn't."
7521426,eng,Of course Tom didn't come.
6350480,eng,I usually drink tea with meals.
1027037,eng,Tom beat the drum at a slow tempo.
1428036,eng,We had to stay home because of the storm.
2233715,eng,This is offensive.
3904871,eng,I just heard you visited them.
6627478,eng,Hardly was the door shut when Mrs. Challenger darted out from the dining-room. The small woman was in a furious temper. She barred her husband's way like an enraged chicken in front of a bulldog.
868760,eng,"Afterwards, we went to Bethlehem to see the statues."
317334,eng,She could solve the problem with ease.
4794426,eng,Tom didn't try to hide the truth.
2259547,eng,They climbed up on the roof to clean the chimney.
7178782,eng,Tom said that Mary is probably still grouchy.
2538597,eng,You won't have any trouble with Tom now.
2375749,eng,I knew you looked familiar.
3620181,eng,Tom should've finished his homework by now.
931030,eng,It's because I want to become a translator.
7515450,eng,I don't think Tom is a very good lawyer.
5993505,eng,Why do we sneeze?

7544195,eng,Tom is already out of school.
6519238,eng,Why couldn't Tom and Mary do that?
5423332,eng,"Yeah, you're right."
3121903,eng,Could you please call and give Tom my apologies?
1229171,eng,I'm really glad to have met you and that we became friends.

1548577,eng,It is better to act than to talk.
1305919,eng,I watched TV for two hours yesterday.
7644658,eng,It appears Tom was mistaken.
7439514,eng,They said they isn't ready to leave.
2865962,eng,That's not butter. It's margarine.
2474811,eng,I believe that he knows it.

3734434,eng,Let's get them.
7405288,eng,He denied he said that.
6433361,eng,Tom said he's not looking for a relationship.
2641271,eng,Tom sat next to Mary on the tailgate.
6831355,eng,How long will you wait?
3905671,eng,I told you I was coming.
7169482,eng,I think that Tom might get punished if he does that.
7542619,eng,There's no solid evidence against Tom.
2646147,eng,You do have a problem.
5223661,eng,My children live in Boston.
3734190,eng,I think I'll take a couple of days off next week.
7178753,eng,Tom said that Mary is probably still the one responsible for getting that done.

7152963,eng,Tom visited Mary in Australia.
7440918,eng,They said they understood.
292092,eng,He was very thirsty and asked for some water.
2040091,eng,"The day pulls to a close is a barbarism, possibly entirely opaque if you fail to recognize it as a translation of ""The day draws to a close."""
6421525,eng,Mary says she knows Tom won't do that.
2545229,eng,Tom appears to be losing.
4317003,eng,Give me back my wallet.
7458163,eng,Why did she run off to Algiers?
306580,eng,They got into difficulties.

7404503,eng,She told me she's nervous.
5102128,eng,He handed her a bouquet of flowers.

7521129,eng,I know Tom is a good skater.
2712669,eng,"This movie isn't that interesting, is it?"
7440760,eng,They said they're very busy.
6124539,eng,Tom suggested that I not do that anymore.
5111914,eng,Mary accused Tom unfairly.
4529246,eng,The police officer advised us to leave.

6511146,eng,"Tom and Mary are already in Boston, aren't they?"
7727771,eng,May Tom be free.
4013046,eng,What did Tom mean by that?
2214314,eng,He's kind of cute.
7211784,eng,Tom told me that he thought Mary was disgusting.
6334775,eng,What do you plan on doing tomorrow after school?
6256755,eng,Tom asked if Mary really needed to do that by herself.
6237121,eng,I pretended that I didn't know Tom was rich.
7518419,eng,I know Tom isn't a careless driver.
6388409,eng,The world slowly walks towards wisdom.
890435,eng,"In other words, you're stupid."
317658,eng,You must not go there with them.
6958524,eng,How were you able to pull this off?
2840154,eng,The truck nearly ran me over.
2849438,eng,That boy is a constant source of worry to his mother.
6896461,eng,You and I have got to stay together.
7394550,eng,She said she wasn't having much fun.
6498652,eng,Tom and Mary say they have something to do this afternoon.
2023062,eng,She wrote a small book on china.
7249871,eng,Sami was kind.
6351059,eng,I think Tom might cry.
6439668,eng,Tom is very upset by this.
542562,eng,This book is so easy that even a child can read it.
285719,eng,There was a new addition to his family.
6662579,eng,"Tom is pretty cute, don't you think?"
6770213,eng,Everybody is ready.
241915,eng,Up to now they have worked very hard.
318157,eng,Beauty is but skin deep.
7156651,eng,Sami didn't enjoy it.
5014324,eng,Tom is relatively my age and he's a singer. That doesn't happen every day.
6863273,eng,Tom gave this watch to me.
3915450,eng,I think perhaps I can help you.
3737023,eng,I'd prefer not to comment on that now.
285296,eng,His mother is an English teacher.
5521349,eng,Why is Tom mad at you?
7440035,eng,They told me they were depressed.

7408617,eng,They hanged themselves last night.
6462280,eng,Sami took his own life.
7539417,eng,I couldn't find a single picture of Tom wearing a hat.
887154,eng,She got him into trouble.
2745095,eng,She treats me as if I were a stranger.
2954923,eng,You're an extraordinary woman.
1829530,eng,What do you really think?
3727806,eng,I've just received some delightful news.
5451924,eng,What is the title of your new book?
1572927,eng,Give me your book.
7444004,eng,Tom and Mary told me they want to die.
6620789,eng,To Sherlock Holmes she is always the woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name.
3264733,eng,I'd like to try something new.
6518037,eng,Tom and Mary often contradict themselves.
3914169,eng,Why did you kill them?
3918097,eng,We can help you find her.
7471850,eng,Tom and Mary played on their college teams.
6849232,eng,I expected Tom to finish first.
7383162,eng,She hid herself under the covers.
7731593,eng,Tom is sitting on the bench outside the library.
6412783,eng,Mary said she didn't want to do anything with Tom.

46670,eng,The reviewer is sharply critical of the novel.
7205225,eng,Sami doesn't want to hang out with Layla.
2047644,eng,I'll just be extra careful.

3164456,eng,There's no reason to keep it a secret.
2247932,eng,I'm awake now.
1155884,eng,Tom set a trap.
6048552,eng,Tom likes to play poker with his friends.
2648749,eng,That had to hurt.
7357604,eng,Sami already has a ride.
1898120,eng,They've had plenty of time.
7443794,eng,Tom and Mary told me that they were agnostic.
7511113,eng,I didn't know that you would do that with Tom.
4535990,eng,"You forgot to tell Tom where to meet us, didn't you?"
7245223,eng,Sami came off the bus.
6108286,eng,I'm glad to hear that Tom didn't do that.
6528799,eng,I'm not sure how to get to your house.
3405436,eng,You don't need to go if you don't want to.
6685174,eng,Tom was fairly nervous.
3359696,eng,Are you sure this is the spot?
2431203,eng,Politics is the art of preventing people from getting involved in what concerns them.
6110463,eng,We're getting ready to do that.
4500983,eng,It's a crazy market.
1932085,eng,He wished she had more time.
1181701,eng,It's a happy thing.
6271043,eng,Tom said he's heartbroken.
7226388,eng,I don't think that you believe that.
2547002,eng,Tom is also an artist.
7166051,eng,Sami had no clue how his keys got there.
6335434,eng,Tom didn't know that you were planning to stay.
6541004,eng,Consider it a friendly warning.
6589184,eng,Is any part of our meal served with live animals?
6168572,eng,Tom turned off the anti-aliasing option.
7404868,eng,"He isn't so tall, is he?"
6240457,eng,I understand that you've begun to do that.
2255433,eng,You've got mail.
5964835,eng,No one's standing in front of the entrance.
6717531,eng,Sami was Layla's biographer.
6521884,eng,"Tom and Mary are ready, aren't they?"
1203737,eng,I like your friends.
71373,eng,Whom do you respect most in your life?
4759519,eng,Where is the tree?
7733734,eng,We must keep Tom from doing that.
1026901,eng,Tom came in second in the race.
6266996,eng,Tom definitely had to do that.
6430131,eng,"Tom wouldn't tell anybody, would he?"
264837,eng,To know oneself is very difficult.
6245012,eng,I think Tom would be miserable here.
2705427,eng,Something was bothering him.
3161682,eng,You'd better go help Tom.
5355550,eng,Does she really want that?
2361785,eng,I went ahead and ate your dinner since you weren't here.
2149741,eng,This is the book I read after finishing my homework.
4751215,eng,I try to avoid him as much as possible.
6272972,eng,Tom did that without me.
7520634,eng,I hope that I can rely on you.
7116474,eng,Tom wants this song to be played at his funeral.
3930282,eng,Dan blamed Linda for causing him to be late.
2912912,eng,It seems something's gone wrong.
7126026,eng,It's not safe in here.
2245936,eng,I like mysteries.
7196771,eng,I wasn't surprised Tom didn't have to do the same thing I had to do.
5758269,eng,Tom took photos.
6845136,eng,I haven't kissed Mary yet.
7240068,eng,I know that it's highly unlikely we'll be able to sell all this stuff.
7587487,eng,"He said that he had a date, but, in fact, it was just an excuse to leave the lovers alone."
6673928,eng,"The giant bumphead parrotfish is an amazing fish that can live to be 40 years old, growing up to four feet long and 100 pounds."
6246311,eng,I don't know what Tom really wants.
6375975,eng,Stop defending Sami.
1095116,eng,Tom couldn't get his hands on everything he needed.
6252587,eng,Tom said he wished he hadn't told Mary to show John how to do that.
3730609,eng,What's this right here?
280704,eng,"All of a sudden, I was shaken out of my sleep by someone."
2892151,eng,There's someone I've got to see.
7734076,eng,Tom doesn't want to dance with Mary.
6372289,eng,Does your husband beat you?
6506592,eng,Do you really think Tom and Mary were impressed?
6583284,eng,Think!
3498705,eng,That's just your imagination.
6759919,eng,Tom wanted to know who Mary planned to go swimming with.
6262867,eng,I hope to see you again soon.
7539502,eng,Neither Tom nor Mary has done anything disrespectful.
3335406,eng,It is hard to determine the distance.
2819545,eng,Tom doesn't understand the environmental impacts associated with a Western lifestyle.
6372726,eng,Sami's car was sitting in the parking lot.
456393,eng,Mom is washing the dog because he's dirty.
2953822,eng,We were surprised by Tom's decision.
6699481,eng,"Sami discovered the body of his father, dead on the couch."
2549188,eng,You were so cute.
7381422,eng,Mary has no one to help her.
3758534,eng,The Internet is a series of tubes.
7410149,eng,They knew that they were overweight.
487941,eng,I used to swim every day when I was a child.
288011,eng,He looked for the key to the door.
2258679,eng,His misfortunes caused him great bitterness.
6869440,eng,Tom should have stayed in Boston a few more days.
20316,eng,Speak your mind.
6172554,eng,I like that colourful dress more.
7490310,eng,The dark hills in the surroundings responded with a mocking echo.
60850,eng,This textbook has a lot of notes.
274657,eng,"If we don't obtain an adequate knowledge of their culture, a lot of problems could easily arise."
2814648,eng,He was in a hurry to see his father.
52579,eng,John passed the examination.
3183468,eng,You will not speak to me like that.
7436441,eng,Tom and Mary said that they'd buy what was needed.
2359112,eng,I've been gone too long.
1739539,eng,This is the last time I'll annoy the teacher.
3909520,eng,We'll show her.
3101237,eng,It's not safe in the city centre after midnight on weekends because of all the drunks roaming the streets.
3390218,eng,Who's going to make sure that things are going to get done the way that they should?
7143661,eng,I didn't think Tom would understand.
7440197,eng,They said that they spoke French.
2458620,eng,I think you've made your point.
6651969,eng,Tom said that he was determined to win.
7140648,eng,Here's a list of everything we need to buy.
6125330,eng,I think that really surprised Tom.
3423179,eng,Wrong!
6664639,eng,I got mad at Tom because he was late.
7507284,eng,I know that Tom isn't the only one who can do that.
6263467,eng,Didn't you do that yesterday?
7513806,eng,I know that Tom used to be a heavy smoker.
20532,eng,"When I tried to move the desk, one of its legs made a jarring sound as it scraped across the floor."
7179439,eng,Tom said that he's never eaten Thai food.
7220072,eng,Sami still works at Walmart to this day.
6230021,eng,I'm pretty sure that Tom wasn't the one who did that.
29133,eng,"It would be unwise, not to say stupid, of you to quit your first job after only six months."
6040201,eng,Can we trust a man like that?
6532101,eng,Why does Tom eat pork?
7250324,eng,Sami was living in that house.
3738480,eng,Does anybody recognize this?
3722037,eng,We'll spread the word.
305079,eng,They are free from care.
7132403,eng,How often do you update your website?
7732881,eng,We must preserve our natural resources.
6354305,eng,Tom thought Mary might be permitted to do that.
30264,eng,It is the first step which is troublesome.
6910107,eng,"Tom is leaving soon, isn't he?"
7132009,eng,Did Tom and Mary have an argument?
6909826,eng,"Tom is smarter than Mary, isn't he?"
5099025,eng,In my country people cannot stand those who are more intelligent than they are.
5909649,eng,I still sometimes read autobiographies.
6265641,eng,Where will you be tomorrow?
3729085,eng,I need a good reason not to kill you.
3519388,eng,Last night was wonderful.
6426331,eng,I encouraged Mary to be herself.
4228555,eng,"I love you, but not that way."
292978,eng,It seems like he had never met his father before.
3416901,eng,"Tom is very sharp, isn't he?"
2644940,eng,Tom felt a little guilty.
6222169,eng,Did anyone go to Boston with you?
6412745,eng,Mary said she thought I might not want to do that.
2096215,eng,Where's your father now?
6444947,eng,Sami had glasses and contacts.
6588419,eng,Let's go to a concert in LA.
23058,eng,We're booked for the whole month on Broadway.
3938904,eng,I often listen to sad music.
3064282,eng,I believe that suicide is wrong.
3905271,eng,"You've told him, haven't you?"
2331751,eng,I had this suit custom made for me.
4699954,eng,Tom can play the drums.
3723188,eng,I'm up here.
6227715,eng,How many more years do you think it'll take Tom to do that?
7476879,eng,Why do you care what happens?
241525,eng,I have a good eye for the value of antiques.
3961277,eng,The nucleus of a hydrogen atom consists of a single proton. Around this proton orbits a single electron.
6656142,eng,I'm going to try doing that a different way next time.
6126039,eng,Tom has been doing that all morning.
1778770,eng,The sky cleared up.
5879392,eng,Sami sought outside help.
462602,eng,The boy is listening to music.
6436848,eng,Tom will be even better next time.
3342810,eng,You have to come now.
2953054,eng,It just wouldn't be right.
1971882,eng,You must be sad as you have lost one of your friends.
2820671,eng,You'd better have it patented before you put it on the market.
3330468,eng,I just want to get out of here.
7001499,eng,Don't touch that setting. What did I tell you!? Now you've inverted all the colors!
2038470,eng,She massaged his back.
3920703,eng,Everyone is talking about us.
6855557,eng,Tom was paralyzed with fear.
6522681,eng,Tom and Mary said they were sick.
907472,eng,"Just as it sometimes happens that deformed offspring are produced by deformed parents, and sometimes not, so the offspring produced by a female are sometimes female, sometimes not, but male, because the female is as it were a deformed male."
7409226,eng,They always speak their minds.
3428560,eng,Tom has been a perfect gentleman.
3689957,eng,It is apparent that the architect devoted much attention to details.
7399074,eng,"She killed the tiger, didn't she?"
3893150,eng,She knows us well.
6696164,eng,Sami hired a good defense team.
4814574,eng,Southbound.
6064970,eng,Tom and Mary went to the same junior high school.
590491,eng,Once you light the fuse you'll have fifteen seconds to get to safety.
7544128,eng,Tom was obviously displeased.
6124524,eng,Tom and John are like brothers.
260415,eng,I regret having been rude to him.
436745,eng,I like the green bicycle more than the pink.
2948325,eng,This car has good gas mileage.
7521197,eng,Who knows that Tom is here?
7378616,eng,Mary wrote down her phone number.
6230249,eng,Tom would stay in Boston longer if his parents would let him.
1664253,eng,It was the best thing that ever happened to me.
5907715,eng,We can't see each other anymore.
5746550,eng,Tom wants his food bland.
5816178,eng,We must address the low standing of America test scores amongst industrialized nations in math and science.
7221875,eng,I want you to consider the possibility Tom is right.
7182152,eng,Tom said that he spent all day trying to find Mary.
354379,eng,I like cats.
3561843,eng,"When I was studying at Beijing University, my parents came to China and traveled for three months."
5736248,eng,We only accept cash payment.
19279,eng,The athletic meeting went on as scheduled.
886972,eng,She asked him to come into her house.
2006525,eng,I hope he's wrong.
6868546,eng,We should have celebrated together.
6411162,eng,Mary didn't read any of the messages Tom sent to her.
2862896,eng,He is not your dad.
3153294,eng,She is unbeaten at that video game.
7517013,eng,I thought maybe you wouldn't show up.
7543787,eng,Tom walked quickly to the door.
2387280,eng,I must have nodded off.
7443914,eng,Tom and Mary told me they're pessimistic.
6220438,eng,Tom may not be thirsty.
295304,eng,He comes on strong.
49389,eng,The house gets painted every five years.
928630,eng,"How long will it take? ""About two weeks."""
7228681,eng,I don't think that Tom will be upset about that.
7506785,eng,I know Tom knows that I'll never be able to do that.
261585,eng,I caught a cold.
1886769,eng,What do we do now?
7508062,eng,I know Tom doesn't know Mary knows how to do that.
253973,eng,I soon learned how to swim.
6242748,eng,Tom is still reluctant to do that for you.
1992680,eng,Tom is clearly a paranoid schizophrenic.
7127816,eng,Tom denies using any such tactics.
3856813,eng,"Every night when you say a prayer, say a prayer for daddy."
54569,eng,Knowledge of computers is basic to all sciences.
6335725,eng,"Last month, my family and I moved to Boston."
7168441,eng,I think that Tom is adventurous.
324835,eng,Yoko bought some of them.
6266665,eng,"Tom doesn't like swimming, but Mary does."
7382333,eng,He has a wife and kids.
2272500,eng,Tom won't give in.
4493104,eng,Do you really need to check your phone every 30 seconds?
6335773,eng,"If you think it'll make you happy, go ahead and do that."
6378991,eng,Sami was a man of ill repute.
5916026,eng,Tom was the first one to volunteer.
6422402,eng,Mary said she won't agree to do that.
4014397,eng,Let me call you back in a minute.
7514879,eng,Tom paid a lot of money for this guitar.
23378,eng,Our world is only one small part of the universe.
2646555,eng,Mary could be a model.
5301589,eng,Tom has a mole under his left eye.
6409827,eng,I wonder why Mary didn't do that the way I asked her to.
1892800,eng,Please give me a pillow and a blanket.
1207576,eng,I haven't met anyone that boasts of being a jazz pianist.
3534072,eng,My elder sister is good at playing the guitar.
5785976,eng,Live not for time but for eternity.
5975680,eng,What Tom said was surprising.
2276097,eng,I don't like that sentence.
7515968,eng,I know Tom knows Mary ought to do that.
2592712,eng,"It's grammatically correct, but a native would never say that."
1140063,eng,She promised not to tell anyone.
6873365,eng,I can't help thinking that my son is still alive.
269254,eng,New indirect taxes were imposed on spirits.
5165600,eng,Who will guard the guards themselves?
7508856,eng,I didn't know that Tom knew who did that to Mary.
261924,eng,I will be watching TV about this time tomorrow.
51605,eng,A Mr Smith came to see you.
2308264,eng,I couldn't possibly do that.
5277880,eng,I can't believe I finally managed to do it.
7385401,eng,She leaned back in her chair.
388865,eng,There are only five minutes left till the train leaves and she hasn't appeared.
7511914,eng,I didn't know that I'd be allowed to do that.
1844216,eng,Start the car.
2958093,eng,Tom seems reluctant to leave.
6513301,eng,Tom and Mary admitted that they were confused.
4811685,eng,The teacher compared my poem with a fellow student's.
2298410,eng,"Believe it or not, peaches and almonds are family."
310873,eng,She looks very young as against her husband.
7474548,eng,They made up their minds to do that.
2176269,eng,Emili is pretty.
6662317,eng,"Tom was lonely, but Mary wasn't."
3503222,eng,Tom took his coat off and hung it up in the closet.
6853596,eng,"There, mute, and, as the traitress deemed, unknown, / dreading the Danaan's vengeance, and the sword / of Trojans, wroth for Pergamus o'erthrown, / dreading the anger of her injured lord, / sat Troy's and Argos' fiend, twice hateful and abhorred."
7543160,eng,Tom came back a little after lunch.
6665302,eng,"Tom likes chocolate, but I don't."
6527227,eng,Tom said he didn't feel like doing that again.
315647,eng,"Even though she was a heavy woman, she danced well."
5756507,eng,I saw Tom kissing another girl.
1898083,eng,This is weird.
7519064,eng,I knew Tom was through doing that.
6420575,eng,Did Mary say she didn't need to do that?
7564626,eng,"Ak is the Master Woodsman of the world; he sees everything, and knows more than the sons of men."
7342601,eng,"That's what this is really about, isn't it?"
4012045,eng,Are you sure you don't know what it was?
3135934,eng,"You don't think that's going to happen, do you?"
290475,eng,He denied knowing anything about it.
1600599,eng,Have you played Minecraft?
7227309,eng,I don't think that Tom knows why Mary doesn't like to do that.
5953586,eng,It's a common idiom.
36734,eng,"However hard it may rain, we will start tomorrow."
6378443,eng,Sami asked for the money back.
7286946,eng,Sami couldn't make that promise.
2359554,eng,I've got a bad hangover.
6660198,eng,Tom's French is better than Mary's.
2716861,eng,I wonder why no one tells the truth.
7063360,eng,"I really want to move to Finland, but it's more important I improve my Swedish first."
6168035,eng,Mary has an extensive collection of yuri anime.
7228465,eng,I don't think that Tom would be willing to lend me his new bicycle.
6596524,eng,I can't fall asleep or breathe.
6714223,eng,Sami lost all memory of the attack due to the trauma.
73241,eng,It's impossible to learn English in a month.
1124635,eng,I can't excuse what I did.
7513240,eng,I know Tom is likely to be able to do that.
4496526,eng,The band is now doing a sound check.
2707236,eng,Please don't make so much noise. I'm trying to work.
2267965,eng,"The bill's correct, thank you."
7471076,eng,Tom and Mary didn't know how long they'd slept.
918772,eng,Man is unhappy because he doesn't know he's happy. It's only that.
2360705,eng,I hear you went to Harvard.
2395998,eng,Don't make the same mistake I did.
65457,eng,I can produce several pieces a day if I'm lucky.
3582260,eng,"I know what, we'll visit Tom, Paul and Mary this weekend!"
508836,eng,The child fell out of bed.
323191,eng,Tomorrow morning will be OK.
2570808,eng,You've lost your umbrella.
6656887,eng,Is that red car in front of your house Tom's?
6229274,eng,I knew Tom would be annoyed.
7442738,eng,They think they're smarter than me.
6067411,eng,Layla thrilled to meet Sami in person.
3079614,eng,Tom knows that he's got some explaining to do.
7516533,eng,I know that Tom is a very good artist.
6310295,eng,You need a specialized tool in order to fix this.
2805728,eng,This should be useful.
5360698,eng,You don't have to say a word.
292594,eng,He is fond of wandering about.
4918975,eng,Tickets go on sale Monday.
7160893,eng,Sami didn't open the front door for Layla.
5938751,eng,Why don't you go outside?
5215386,eng,Let's give Tom another round of applause.
5736578,eng,Potatoes are very versatile.
6516813,eng,Tom and Mary are a lot different now.
241529,eng,We have to take advantage of this situation.
2904680,eng,Can he play the guitar?
5777735,eng,"Come on, you can do it."
7388890,eng,She's doing her homework now.
48843,eng,There is food on the desk.
6759543,eng,You have no business here.
6223971,eng,Tom may be amused by what's going on.
6092047,eng,Aren't you guys hungry?
3452235,eng,"Communism tries to overcome capitalism, but so far that goal has not been achieved."
6495485,eng,Tom and Mary said they thought they could do that by themselves.
6430748,eng,It seems that both Tom and Mary like classical music.
4233787,eng,What were your grades like in high school?
4667313,eng,When will you take a bath?
4844044,eng,Why did you bring them?
3907832,eng,Tell him where you are.
1990353,eng,Tom sometimes has trouble keeping his balance.
4098166,eng,It takes sushi chefs two years just to learn how to prepare rice.
3912667,eng,I simply don't love her.
6256082,eng,You'd be foolish not to do that.
289537,eng,He once sailed up the Thames.
3454513,eng,Do not reuse.
5726315,eng,"It's unfortunate, but it happens."
3446889,eng,It's only a play.
6351524,eng,Where did Tom sing?
2640213,eng,Tom and Mary spend a lot of money on their son.
6659334,eng,Tom always tells me to drive carefully.
3516155,eng,What? That's what he called me?
3133040,eng,"You didn't happen to get her phone number, did you?"
1552345,eng,To what do I owe this unexpected pleasure?
1655487,eng,Let's get down and dirty.
29387,eng,How many payments will it take to pay off this loan?
6495153,eng,Tom and Mary said there wasn't anything they could do about that.
5922204,eng,Kill all the survivors.
7518981,eng,I know Tom is slightly overweight.
4529422,eng,"After Tom left, we started arguing."
257183,eng,I'll never do anything by halves.
7131024,eng,Tom had no reason to want Mary dead.
65792,eng,Electrical appliances have made housework easier.
7514959,eng,Mary thinks that Tom is the man for her.
6232328,eng,Tom has already told me he doesn't know how to do that.
287079,eng,His temperature is normal.
5746284,eng,Listen to your siblings.
4497617,eng,They should pay me for doing this.
6639373,eng,This picture fascinates me.
3906352,eng,I needed to talk to her.
275674,eng,The big nations should not interfere with the smaller nations.
3720655,eng,I was in an agony of discomfort.
5576364,eng,Tom successfully convinced many people that he possessed paranormal powers.
3931748,eng,Have you cleaned your teeth?
1024874,eng,Tom is shopping for a heavy coat.
7195206,eng,"Why are you here in Australia? You're supposed to be in New Zealand, aren't you?"
6234447,eng,Tom probably doesn't know he's supposed to do that.
7217387,eng,I'm afraid that I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
259970,eng,I was ignorant that he was present.
254446,eng,I was eating dinner then.
6648487,eng,Tom said that he thought that Mary wasn't alone.
7444419,eng,They told me that they liked my idea.
6243697,eng,How many years have you been doing that?
1336,eng,I don't want to be lame; I want to be cool!!
2537392,eng,I'll try to find out when we're supposed to be there.
6497319,eng,We need to make sure Tom and Mary have everything they need.
6226504,eng,Everyone except Tom knew that he didn't need to do that.
6426329,eng,I made Mary go there by herself.
6614237,eng,Tom and Mary are slightly asymmetric.
3498353,eng,Tom was standing at the end of the line.
6029591,eng,It is better for an animal to live a comfortable life in a zoo than to be torn apart by a predator in the wild.
4493166,eng,I don't know what the future will bring.
6454464,eng,We walked eight miles a day and then caught a taxi back to the hotel in the evening.
1873240,eng,The temperature fell to five degrees below zero.
301122,eng,He deposited a lot of money in the bank.
61004,eng,Would you mind helping me carry this suitcase?
7212789,eng,I don't think that Tom has to do that.
6234957,eng,Tom said he didn't have enough money to buy a car.
54320,eng,"I'm sorry to trouble you, but could you tell me the way to the station?"
6268933,eng,Tom said I looked horrified.
5183297,eng,Have you already paid for everything?
461148,eng,I have no time for reading.
2359646,eng,I've got half an hour.
6910191,eng,"Tom is really lucky, isn't he?"
6412636,eng,Mary says she's going to try to help you find Tom.
6243236,eng,I want to know how much money you spent.
453185,eng,I have two daughters.
256596,eng,I spoke so loudly as to be heard by everyone.
2323265,eng,I don't understand how this could have happened.
2018944,eng,He told his story in tears.
4497707,eng,How well does Tom speak French?
6353343,eng,I already know you did that.
2380383,eng,I made a judgment call.
6666964,eng,I don't like popcorn.
7328889,eng,Sami knew he was doing something wrong.
49385,eng,The house was very badly built.
7500889,eng,I know Tom is the one who's supposed to tell Mary that she doesn't need to do that.
2672662,eng,"Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us."
6232922,eng,It would be fantastic if you could do that for me.
6406613,eng,Mary says she doesn't know when Tom is planning to do that.
2387838,eng,I need your recommendations.
4501013,eng,Have you met any of Tom's teammates?
5737895,eng,The numbers are staggering.
7070775,eng,This teacher is really annoying.
56749,eng,I have nothing particular to mention with regard to the affair.
5701011,eng,I'm in prison for a crime I didn't commit.
7397615,eng,She may talk to whoever she wants.
6706289,eng,Tom was wearing a black suit yesterday.
3022468,eng,One sniff of that stuff was enough to make me sick.
2547570,eng,Tom knows what it is.
1285608,eng,No sooner said than done.
40222,eng,I am not the least bit worried.
1886313,eng,Are you still playing golf?
7007577,eng,Maybe they should have told Tom the truth.
3712529,eng,Customs officials carried out a full body search on Tom.
6527348,eng,Tom says he won't have to do that right away.
3417004,eng,"Tom is an interesting person, isn't he?"
7111796,eng,Tom told me Mary laughed at his jokes.
5850694,eng,I'm pretty sure that it won't work.
329441,eng,God is the creator. Heaven and Earth and people and everything apart from God are created.
5345803,eng,Bring them here immediately.
5225952,eng,Don't make promises that you can't or don't intend to keep.
3410772,eng,Tom wasn't satisfied with the results.
243693,eng,"And, most important of all, the stone does not tell us what kind of happiness we should find in that house."
1174796,eng,"Since my mother was sick, I looked after her."
680631,eng,This room is too dark.
6715751,eng,Sami drank and smoked.
3113252,eng,Tom has been giving Mary a hard time.
6513157,eng,"Tom and Mary did that on purpose, didn't they?"
5640431,eng,I don't see any resemblance.
7235341,eng,How did you get involved with her?
7171950,eng,I thought that you were crazy about Tom.
4663428,eng,Tom dyed his hair gray so he'd look older.
319559,eng,The room is in immaculate order.
4496179,eng,I've brought a gift for Tom.
6877420,eng,Tom's ideas seemed crazy.
292688,eng,He took up his pen and began to write.
7132357,eng,Why are you in a hurry to sell your house?
6238756,eng,I've spoken in French with Tom many times.
3688312,eng,I went to bed late in the night.
2255040,eng,You look lovely.
7363265,eng,Sami visited Istanbul during the Eid holiday.
6507523,eng,Tom and Mary said they didn't like their nicknames.
3619741,eng,Tom is the most popular boy in the class.
6125759,eng,Tom doesn't know what Mary will do.
6577590,eng,Follow my finger.
7735276,eng,It was almost midnight when we got home.
54961,eng,Send this by airmail.
2360878,eng,I hope it's worth it.
7395518,eng,He thought he'd find another job.
7111738,eng,That isn't the only reason I'm doing that.
71909,eng,"I love the outdoors, but I hate bugs."
2996983,eng,We need to hire someone with a little more experience.
3227102,eng,That's very optimistic of you.
1950897,eng,I can't believe we finally made it.
3185022,eng,It was a mistake to stay.
44917,eng,At that shop they deal in kitchen utensils.
4135013,eng,What are the symptoms of mushroom poisoning?
6416840,eng,Mary says she plans on staying where she is.
7126816,eng,How naive I was to think that.
6267910,eng,Tom is likely to still be up.
252407,eng,I waited for him till ten.
3200663,eng,I told them my name was Tom.
1877186,eng,Tom is hurt.
1877538,eng,Tom says he needs to ask Mary where she put his camera.
6912658,eng,"Tom is an art critic, isn't he?"
319460,eng,The stage was lit from both sides.
7292056,eng,Mary was smoking.
7521937,eng,I knew Tom was afraid.
6415278,eng,Mary still has a lot of things she has to buy.
6423284,eng,Mary said she had something for you.
1887943,eng,I was told that you saw the accident.
2344597,eng,I feel a lack of confidence because I still have a ton of things to do.
2543541,eng,I'm not going to marry Mary.
2756686,eng,I went inside.
3295430,eng,You must know Tom very well.
5154671,eng,She is as mad as a bag of cats.
307803,eng,"Every time I looked at him, he was yawning."
5736420,eng,There is a good explanation.
6261894,eng,Tom told Mary that he thought John was honest.
6436836,eng,Tom will have his house repainted.
7288784,eng,Sami realized that something was wrong.
7288704,eng,Sami and Farid were fist-fighting.
7270097,eng,Sami didn't want that to happen.
6345369,eng,Tom is the only person who didn't cry.
6413558,eng,Mary is fairly sure she can take care of herself.
2957377,eng,Tom isn't fond of nicknames.
6415105,eng,Mary wouldn't tell me why she didn't like Tom.
5724889,eng,The lobster was good.
6223156,eng,Tom said he doesn't like to do that.
6110418,eng,Tom's shirt was on his bed.
5838879,eng,Fadil and Layla wasted little time to try.
7374316,eng,"Mary is way younger than me, isn't she?"
5840356,eng,I don't want to look like Tom.
2374816,eng,I knew things about Tom that even his parents didn't know.
6354929,eng,I didn't know Tom would ask Mary to help him.
3668500,eng,Utah has some beautiful national parks.
3918596,eng,You've defeated us.
6412881,eng,Mary has promised that she'll never be late again.
1015934,eng,In New Jersey are many unobtrusive buildings.
317870,eng,Don't let the cat out of the bag.
6230847,eng,Tom doesn't think that doing that would be such a bad idea.
7156266,eng,Sami had a brand new pair of shoes.
1561530,eng,Do you have any grandchildren?
7543329,eng,Tom didn't really enjoy the movie.
7733262,eng,Tom wiggled his fingers.
5570707,eng,I can't believe I believed him.
138727,eng,Sometimes critics don't know what they criticise.
844698,eng,Who was it that he phoned?
6256980,eng,Tom says he and Mary hardly ever go cycling together.
32108,eng,Nobody likes it.
7386620,eng,She's doing this for her children.
2483410,eng,This story broke my heart.
6507736,eng,Tom and Mary had hoped that they'd win the lottery.
6354687,eng,How many chairs are there?
6123947,eng,The only thing Tom ever gave me was an old book.
291380,eng,He saved money for the trip.
4155632,eng,He thinks old newspapers are still useful.
7178350,eng,Tom said that Mary knew that John might not want to do that this afternoon.
6527939,eng,Tom didn't want Mary to come to the party.
3258054,eng,I must go to the bank to get more money.
3921293,eng,We're interested in helping Tom.
1337795,eng,Very beautiful. Thank you very much!
5953519,eng,Are you and your family prepared for emergencies?
297503,eng,He taught me how to spell the word.
1093114,eng,Tom put a piece of dry ice into a cup of water.
6257460,eng,Tom told Mary that he thought John was disappointed.
7404312,eng,He realized he was alone.
7388860,eng,She's considering her options.
5729020,eng,Let's see what the future holds.
6964617,eng,That's not too fun.
6899330,eng,"You're going in the wrong direction, aren't you?"
3821858,eng,There were no objections.
3919809,eng,I've asked him to help you.
60701,eng,You're going the wrong way.
5791544,eng,What time is Tom's plane due in?
802961,eng,He would never walk again.
6356924,eng,Tom wondered why Mary wouldn't eat.
5220159,eng,I hope that it'll work.
302204,eng,He is of Japanese ancestry.
7399365,eng,He told me that he understood.
5105254,eng,I find it convenient to receive it.
2237007,eng,Tom isn't responding.
2958693,eng,Tom went into his room and closed the door.
3103477,eng,"You're not going to wear that, are you?"
460361,eng,"When she was young, she was very popular."
6646778,eng,Tom told me he thought my speech was interesting.
5682520,eng,I'll make some pasta.
288670,eng,He belongs to the ESS (English Speaking Society).
3087297,eng,Where can I buy a shirt like that?
3737302,eng,Doing that is a waste of energy.
6126415,eng,I did something really bad today.
7212799,eng,I really wasn't planning on doing that.
2218501,eng,You're very talented.
6896306,eng,"Tom isn't happy about the situation, is he?"
906919,eng,What's your favorite topic of conversation?
6241510,eng,Tomorrow would be a good time to do that.
286063,eng,Do it like he tells you.
3162128,eng,I still think Tom could help.
1875936,eng,Will you join me?
5832621,eng,You're completely out of your mind.
6240765,eng,Tom was the only other person who did that.
2768932,eng,"He told me that he would love me forever, but then he left me shortly after."
21369,eng,A student should not lose sight of his own identity.
298213,eng,His eyes failed him.
6505383,eng,Tom and Mary refused to tell me where they were born.
967978,eng,They are happy with your plan and for you to proceed with writing your material.
7444893,eng,They told me they'd try again.
4902614,eng,That's not a real word.
436529,eng,I don't dare tell him such a thing.
1852499,eng,Show me your passport.
1095350,eng,Tom certainly seems to have learned his lesson.
7214232,eng,Tom told me that he believed that.
802982,eng,He accepted gifts from them.
2753188,eng,We apologized to each other.
5243078,eng,Tom didn't seem to be interested in what I was saying.
3205367,eng,What is her job?
3036506,eng,What incredible memories!
6272293,eng,Tom didn't realize Mary had left.
2268676,eng,There are only two seasons in the tropics.
937388,eng,I need to get my oboe repaired.
6871311,eng,How often do you talk with your parents?
6693176,eng,Sami continued with his life.
3563824,eng,"Now, why do you have to do that?"
259846,eng,I clean up my room every Sunday.
6502459,eng,Tom and Mary said they thought we might have a problem.
6220422,eng,Tom may be incorrect.
1355910,eng,She is leaving for the United States tonight.
3394419,eng,Mary isn't the right girl for Tom.
3823241,eng,Has anyone seen my keys?
7250919,eng,Sami checked in.
274374,eng,My son came to my room.
7721883,eng,There are many pine trees in Rome.
7394683,eng,She said she had a meeting to go to.
6503507,eng,Tom and Mary told me they weren't very good at French.
562905,eng,Yes or no?
7178205,eng,Tom said that Mary ought to do that by herself.
32676,eng,I am looking forward to seeing you again.
5859022,eng,I asked for a beer.
3732341,eng,I still think we should've bought the painting you liked.
2955634,eng,Tom and I have our differences.
3881975,eng,"The King and Queen were overjoyed when they saw their children, and they all lived happily together in the beautiful palace."
7183028,eng,Tom advised Mary not to go to Australia with John.
5774131,eng,Tom has lived alone since his wife died.
7184448,eng,I don't want to come to Australia.
6636581,eng,Tom likes Ukranians because they are Christians.
1028274,eng,Tom never received the money Mary sent him.
7409089,eng,They closed their eyes and fell asleep.
7397160,eng,He said that he was comfortable.
4496168,eng,Tom broke his jaw.
7259307,eng,Sami knows what Layla does.
5638466,eng,The earthquake had a magnitude of six on the Richter scale.
3904478,eng,What do you want them to do?
6106392,eng,The prince must die.
15965,eng,Are you fond of swimming?
6825880,eng,I didn't feel sleepy.
6884637,eng,I think everybody here knows Tom.
7129752,eng,Did you know that Tom wouldn't win?
242661,eng,You are being naughty today.
6326186,eng,"Sami and Layla managed to stay together for six years, but it was a shell of a marriage."
2849916,eng,Smoking is not allowed here. Please feed your cancer outside!
7143111,eng,I'm assuming Tom doesn't care.
7544743,eng,Tom ought to be back soon.
4496513,eng,Is the battery fully charged?
460062,eng,Only for grownups.
2111248,eng,They're scared.
6810466,eng,I can try to reason with Tom.
2887478,eng,I'm a twelve-year-old girl.
4013159,eng,"According to the chief of police, there were no survivors."
7734990,eng,I have to be out of the office until 2:30.
3130935,eng,What's happened is unimportant.
250995,eng,Don't meddle in my affairs.
6271400,eng,Tom handed me an envelope.
6236235,eng,I think Tom would be annoyed if you did that.
3374921,eng,I was in a great mood.
1532022,eng,"She smiled at me, whilst she sang."
6535484,eng,"Do you drink? ""Never."""
66633,eng,"No matter how humble it may be, home is home."
7136682,eng,I thought that the way Tom handled that was good.
2487726,eng,What's in your suitcase?
7117869,eng,You don't seem to have the guts to do that anymore.
5738735,eng,We have high expectations.
3819038,eng,It would be worth trying.
2439792,eng,He's a friend of a friend.
5823090,eng,You're wasting your time with me.
6172465,eng,I decided at once to get to work.
6223619,eng,Tom and Mary plan to do that together.
7443948,eng,Tom and Mary told me they'd sort it out.
2868454,eng,She forgave you.
6348094,eng,I doubt if you'll need to do that.
5066817,eng,I don't like when you bring your work home.
7192117,eng,I had to go to Australia with Tom.
6530156,eng,Tom was with us the entire time.
2458017,eng,The United States faced a Bubonic plague epidemic at the beginning of the twentieth century.
2288988,eng,Don't tell me you can't read.
3821423,eng,That's entirely possible.
1548576,eng,It's time to come clean.
47694,eng,"In the factory, all the equipment was up to date."
6499327,eng,"Tom and Mary wanted to do that, but they didn't know how."
5859693,eng,Tom says I'm narrow-minded.
60098,eng,"Let's sing this song, shall we?"
2853999,eng,Emily stays at home alone when her parents are in the factory.
7215150,eng,Sami opened that door.
3024001,eng,The judge asked the defendant if he knew the difference between telling the truth and telling a lie.
2569247,eng,Russia is a huge country.
5725318,eng,I have to say I felt very safe in Boston.
7267507,eng,Sami was at a local bar.
3913141,eng,Let them talk first.
5165748,eng,I couldn't handle it.
6651104,eng,Tom said that he wouldn't do what I asked him to do.
622636,eng,"Sometimes, questions rather than answers provide us with more information."
6980644,eng,This is a total dork-fest nerd bar.
2198917,eng,I didn't find it funny at all.
3737993,eng,Why aren't you dancing?
6437941,eng,Tom explained his reasons to me.
6243881,eng,I'm sure Tom won't be home on Monday.
25370,eng,We shipped the following to you last week.
6356927,eng,Tom and I went to Boston to see Mary.
4016894,eng,It's clear Tom likes being here in Boston.
5966477,eng,You can't possibly expect me to spend that much money on this piece of junk.
3897607,eng,"I would like to learn to play the piano, guitar and flute."
1097978,eng,Are you healthy?
1091944,eng,A lot of people around here drive trucks.
7384173,eng,She helps anyone that asks her.
6693879,eng,Sami confessed to the cops.
6351489,eng,I need to buy a bag of cement.
6252530,eng,I didn't think Tom would forget to tell Mary what needed to be done.
3897895,eng,Mary wants to have the seats of the dining room chairs reupholstered and the backs recaned.
2230529,eng,It was a divine intervention.
1345956,eng,"Beth told Chris that if he didn't take a bath, she wouldn't go out with him."
249711,eng,"As for me, I am satisfied."
6413196,eng,Mary told me she couldn't remember what happened.
1542091,eng,True philosophy is seeing things as they are.
3315100,eng,That was a very big deal for me.
4099322,eng,Where's the pharmacy?
325264,eng,"After the storm, it was calm."
6116230,eng,Finish it.
7445179,eng,Tom and Mary told everybody they were ticklish.
6341618,eng,"After we finished eating, we went for a walk."
61182,eng,"If you join this club, you will be entitled to use all of its facilities."
3171494,eng,Tom found what he was looking for under the table.
278632,eng,The thief snatched the woman's handbag and took to his heels.
5826754,eng,I am learning Aramaic.
6648037,eng,Tom said that he wished he hadn't given his phone number to Mary.
53903,eng,Hotels are cheaper in the off season.
5217998,eng,I have to keep on working.
5850871,eng,I just don't think what Tom did was right.
7542329,eng,Tom asked Mary to come over for dinner.
6419173,eng,Mary says she thinks Tom really did that.
5936645,eng,I think Tom wants to go to Boston with you.
7353188,eng,Sami lives in the part of Hollywood where all the movie stars live.
7272589,eng,Sami didn't want to miss the bus.
6426593,eng,Mary said she needs to do that.
3154773,eng,There's nothing to eat.
5539030,eng,"Who is younger, Tom or Mary?"
2275363,eng,Don't worry. It's not important.
1279974,eng,"I'm a noob, shoot me."
2367868,eng,He held forth for more than an hour on the evils of nuclear power.
2996270,eng,Nobody's right all the time.
3913255,eng,You let him get away.
7395677,eng,He says he can't wait any longer.
35070,eng,A rose has thorns on its stem.
7117349,eng,"You're not very well informed, are you?"
3818741,eng,Show me what you want.
7392888,eng,He said that he probably won't win.
883871,eng,Many people drink water out of the kitchen faucet.
6354010,eng,Tom wasn't wearing gloves.
7165255,eng,Sami talked about Layla in his last video.
7388842,eng,She's cleaning her glasses.
6412419,eng,I don't think we should leave Mary here by herself.
6423936,eng,Mary said she'd rather not eat now.
5287280,eng,Tom will know what that means.
6523917,eng,I wonder whether Tom was late or not.
256845,eng,I think twice before I smoke.
3355236,eng,It looks like you came prepared.
3730315,eng,How would you like us to proceed?
2164521,eng,Stop talking about my family.
7517366,eng,I know Tom could get Mary to do that.
7561322,eng,Of course he passed the test.
3530026,eng,You don't seem very impressed.
6419977,eng,Mary says she wouldn't agree to do that.
7473974,eng,They didn't know what they should say.
1880375,eng,I was trying to hide my wrinkles.
6252649,eng,We never stay in Boston very long.
6957668,eng,A few minutes later our driver pulled up at a neat little red-brick villa with overhanging eaves which stood by the road.
6237746,eng,"Tom seldom, if ever, complains about anything."
7263980,eng,Sami was screaming and kicking his father off of him.
7149728,eng,We've never lived in Australia.
762129,eng,Did he show you the picture?
1887629,eng,I really need your help.
2054019,eng,Are you a racist?
7502323,eng,I knew Tom was the one who was supposed to tell Mary to do that.
2833241,eng,We can't judge him; he did what he could.
7392468,eng,She told me that she could handle it.
3914059,eng,I barely knew him.
1885517,eng,Where did you humiliate them?
1042558,eng,Tom had no idea that Mary was a serial killer.
2764033,eng,This is a book about obesity.
6508889,eng,I intend to wait until Tom and Mary get here.
7395264,eng,She won't tell me who she's dating.
6659712,eng,Tom went out the door.
5936802,eng,You never said much about what happened.
2873814,eng,I tossed one to Tom.
3486576,eng,"I prefer a tent with storm flaps and intersecting tent poles to provide stability against wind and resistance against the weight of snow, and it must be a two-layer tent."
7544466,eng,Tom took the gun from Mary.
3735986,eng,The leaves have changed colors.
6342621,eng,I wouldn't mind if Tom didn't do that.
5357770,eng,That is one of the ugliest dogs I have ever seen.
3181840,eng,Tom never talks about his family.
6340660,eng,I wonder when Tom will be going to Boston.
7214207,eng,Tom told me that he had to split.
2633372,eng,This is the best way to go.
503640,eng,Doctor: Take a chill pill and then call me in the morning.
5228207,eng,In the theater.
870575,eng,The car is in front of the garage.
7173877,eng,I thought you had already eaten.
7437743,eng,Tom and Mary said they'd complain.
4978122,eng,"Nah, I wouldn't say anything to a guy like Tom. ""That's right. Why would you say anything to a blabbermouth like him, of all people?"""
3428509,eng,We did that just for fun.
7168890,eng,I think that Tom is still cold.
5369034,eng,Tom wanted to finish the job.
689111,eng,Is it a yes or a no?
4012910,eng,Where did Tom learn how to play the guitar like that?
6731842,eng,"You remember Mary's homemade stews, don't you?"
248199,eng,We enjoyed the dinner to the full.
2245769,eng,I felt lucky.
6255684,eng,Tom said Mary knew John might not be allowed to do that.
2541989,eng,I'd be happy to get it for you.
5263643,eng,Now let's try to change this sentence.
310660,eng,I think she was trying to pull a fast one.
6069018,eng,Did you watch that movie by yourself?
7511413,eng,Mary never received the flowers Tom sent her.
5850545,eng,You don't need to tell Tom. He already knows.
466241,eng,"All of us, except him, went."
7177447,eng,Tom said that Mary was planning on going surfing.
5701889,eng,I don't see a single way out!
6577444,eng,He's going through a stage.
6116192,eng,This is sharp.
296332,eng,He thrust some coins into my pocket.
1889704,eng,Tom kissed Mary on her forehead.
7205972,eng,Sami and Layla hit the year mark.
313720,eng,She brought his lunch today.
5251960,eng,May the best man or woman win.
7250318,eng,Sami was a sibling of Layla's.
1093856,eng,Tom had drunk too much coffee so he couldn't sleep.
3970871,eng,We went walking on the shore of the lake.
7738366,eng,I don't know what happened to the boy.
5006757,eng,Your breath stinks.
1094980,eng,Tom decided not to talk about the war.
1272973,eng,I know she puts up with a lot from me.
7294524,eng,Sami told Layla all about it.
2547761,eng,I'm glad you're home.
6525688,eng,Are both Tom and Mary still single?
1151772,eng,I can't stop writing.
6428922,eng,Mary regrets what she did.
6500256,eng,I think Tom and Mary don't really have the courage to do that.
2155028,eng,The girl was quick as a flash.
7173947,eng,I thought that maybe I could help.
6366765,eng,St. Patrick is the patron saint of Ireland.
2111223,eng,They're watching.
4718990,eng,"Let's have one for the road!, Tom told his friend at the pub."
7367699,eng,I'm not to that point yet.
2646017,eng,One of us has to do it.
2812119,eng,I thought he was coming.
534751,eng,"I contacted them the other day, but I was not able to get an answer."
48017,eng,The performance was received with applause.
6358646,eng,I also cried.
6241862,eng,I think Tom should be more patient.
6946911,eng,Mary laughed and then sang along with Tom.
5911478,eng,I wasn't able to talk Tom out of doing that.
6604331,eng,"Quiet and shy, harbor seals can be seen year-round resting on rocks just offshore."
44948,eng,"Your offer is very attractive, but we will have to think about it."
289907,eng,He was injured badly in the accident.
2586264,eng,She removed even this one.
6685160,eng,Tom is talking with the woman.
282404,eng,Stop making a fool of yourself.
6239047,eng,I should probably show Tom how to do that.
7731791,eng,Tom is probably a little heavier than I am.
286811,eng,His behavior was theatrical.
6651129,eng,Tom said that he wouldn't be in Boston next week.
298907,eng,He is free to spend his money.
43800,eng,The trees are planted at intervals of thirty meters.
4495707,eng,Our neighbors are arguing again.
294589,eng,He turned his artistic gifts to good account by becoming a painter.
251172,eng,My uncle can speak German.
5129484,eng,The well has long since dried up.
7213061,eng,I have to be aggressive.
3479651,eng,Tom reflected on what he had done.
249319,eng,We are traveling to France by air.
1345958,eng,The train flipped over.
6241049,eng,I should just tell Tom I made a mistake.
2203560,eng,You're useless.
6124907,eng,Who does Tom think will help us?
7438970,eng,They told me that they were very busy.
1024574,eng,Tom likes chocolate very much.
38867,eng,Will you please shut the door?
5848588,eng,How did you do that so quickly?
7387362,eng,He couldn't take his socks off.
7516336,eng,Tom didn't watch television yesterday.
1752054,eng,He knows how to interrogate people.
7440717,eng,They said they felt rejected.
2538607,eng,Tom's not at all sure what he should do.
1094979,eng,Tom decided not to tell Mary about what John had done.
306881,eng,They are constantly trying to outdo each other.
7287507,eng,Sami was yelling so loud that customers heard him.
6428217,eng,Mary lent her camera to Tom.
6344568,eng,We might run into Tom at the party?
3650019,eng,I'm out!
7357062,eng,I can hear your voice.
7400716,eng,She thinks she's related to me.
6270170,eng,There are children here.
5617887,eng,We were in the Rio de Janeiro botanical gardens.
6253218,eng,Tom said he wanted to do that again.
6713828,eng,Sami was a kid.
1212412,eng,He returned back home after being away for ten months.
6653240,eng,Tom said that he needs to study French.
2063963,eng,Tom is trying to suppress a smile.
302392,eng,He raises horses and cattle.
2958109,eng,Tom seldom goes out.
6505725,eng,I don't think Tom and Mary know how to play golf.
3310273,eng,We've all seen that before.
6126287,eng,What does Tom want to do that for?
7263922,eng,Sami was mentally ill.
2958439,eng,Tom violently kicked the garbage can.
266022,eng,I am still a bit sore after my operation.
7143091,eng,I think you shouldn't have gone there by yourself.
6413684,eng,I wonder whether Mary really meant what she said.
2299551,eng,I brought you a peace offering.
262274,eng,I went as far as Kyoto by train.
7443862,eng,Tom and Mary told me that they're unbiased.
7208840,eng,Sami never vacuums his apartment.
3724993,eng,I'll do everything in my power to convince Tom.
6266808,eng,Have you already read this?
3312072,eng,We'll have to wait for Tom's response.
1895785,eng,You can't use that.
7222300,eng,I'm fairly certain we're being watched.
5166579,eng,I think it's amazing.
5354247,eng,"The Earth is a planet, not a star."
6414557,eng,Mary thought she was smarter than anybody else.
1094144,eng,Tom failed to heed warning signs.
3826014,eng,I can't find the broom.
6854059,eng,She does that sometimes.
2230440,eng,It's a pity that I'm late.
6248203,eng,Tom was afraid to even try to do that.
3779113,eng,You were always on my mind.
311031,eng,She got wet to the skin.
1026058,eng,Tom doesn't know who wrote the graffiti on the wall.
6710062,eng,Why is everyone on their phone?
1307845,eng,I secretly hoped this would happen.
7410090,eng,They looked like they were miserable.
5738441,eng,Be careful while traveling.
5296952,eng,Can any of you speak French?
2870215,eng,It wasn't all that funny.
7383594,eng,She burned herself.
7503619,eng,I didn't know that you were still living with your parents.
3754648,eng,"Then they took each other by the hand, and went forth from the great palace of ice."
2953231,eng,My computer cost a lot of money.
4665230,eng,Tom doesn't seem to be hungry.
3402455,eng,"You were worried, weren't you?"
612231,eng,"If you've never had a pint of Guinness in a real Irish pub, I highly recommend it."
4502308,eng,You should stay away from Tom.
5275227,eng,I must be at the wrong place.
57272,eng,"This dress shrank, and what's more it faded."
6388228,eng,Translate all the lines of this text.
4748687,eng,Thanks a lot for the telephone you gave me.
1470867,eng,She really got on my nerves.
6384241,eng,This is Sami's style of doing things.
3738223,eng,What do I do till then?
2212222,eng,Why don't you tell us a little something about yourself?
6583255,eng,Sacrilege!
1027488,eng,I wanted to ask Tom how long he had lived in India.
6233607,eng,All Tom does is read.
7192181,eng,I have no objection to Tom going to Australia with Mary.
6990432,eng,People can slowly become addicted to video gaming. Some may play for hours. They lose interest in doing other things. They stop going to school or work.
2713273,eng,Tom seems a little worried.
5109487,eng,Tom came over for dinner yesterday evening.
2549686,eng,Tom had a cat.
273067,eng,The teacher asked me to read my paper in front of the class.
7441303,eng,Tom and Mary are cops.
3518930,eng,They did what had to be done.
2952419,eng,I should probably go and see Tom.
272352,eng,Would you like red wine or white wine?
323252,eng,Will it be hot again tomorrow?
310788,eng,"She is not at all a beauty, but she has an unspeakable charm."
7724914,eng,All overs are ill.
7733733,eng,Let me lead the way.
6526564,eng,Tom said he didn't want to argue about this anymore.
28366,eng,There used to be a big pond around here.
6357238,eng,Tom wasn't mad at us.
316165,eng,She had a white book under her arm.
6419718,eng,I saw how much Mary was enjoying herself.
4997283,eng,Can you spell your name for me?
7732067,eng,Tom seemed really freaked out by that.
6092098,eng,"If you want to sit, bring yourself a chair."
6004017,eng,My science is superior to your religion.
7178584,eng,Tom said Mary knew that she might be permitted to do that by herself.
6420688,eng,Mary told me she's never talked to Tom.
3724225,eng,It scares me to death.
664029,eng,Which brother did you see?
6272794,eng,Tom got Mary to do that for him.
6243046,eng,It would be impossible to do that again.
2215637,eng,Tom will be over.
6501758,eng,Please tell Tom and Mary what you think they need to do.
6223512,eng,Tom's house isn't very far from mine.
458348,eng,Not everything on the web can be found through Google.
6427292,eng,"Mary is optimistic, isn't she?"
2263579,eng,"My dear, don't be shy!"
2881964,eng,The temperature is lower than usual.
270025,eng,One can't learn to do anything without making mistakes.
62664,eng,There were two cakes. I ate one and then I ate the other.
3825122,eng,Now look what you've done.
6512888,eng,Tom and Mary said that they enjoyed the party.

7182738,eng,Tom said he didn't think that he could do that.
7439741,eng,They said they didn't speak French.
3325421,eng,Tom isn't usually this obstinate.
296646,eng,He promised to come home early tonight.
3721922,eng,I haven't lost my mind.
25481,eng,You bit the hand that fed you.
3131628,eng,That's not going to happen for years.
1943,eng,The recent scandals involving altar boys and religious leaders have undermined the faith people have in the Church.
6651795,eng,Tom said that he was happy that you didn't do that.
6907553,eng,Developing hand-eye coordination is one reason behind having a gym class.
3913770,eng,We should leave them alone.
6174644,eng,Sami called the police immediately.
6658978,eng,I don't listen to music when I'm studying.
6091208,eng,Tom grew suspicious.
294021,eng,He went there to learn English.
4483284,eng,Tom often talks to his parents on Skype.
4402092,eng,Excuse me for being dressed like this.
66167,eng,Your dream may come true at any moment.

6254243,eng,Tom has a parrot that speaks French.
6173590,eng,Sami walked away from the fight.
1120774,eng,He isn't an American.
6354169,eng,Tom told me he enjoyed it.
6117864,eng,I don't think Tom enjoys hiking.
1555354,eng,Flavio is in his senior year of high school.
23125,eng,We all desire success.
5788297,eng,I really do feel sorry for Tom.
6221105,eng,Doing that isn't a bad idea.
2951490,eng,All Tom does nowadays is swim.
7172113,eng,I thought that you were used to living in a trailer.
6272443,eng,Tom told Mary that he'd do that.
6415082,eng,This is where Mary stays when she's in Boston.
5008944,eng,Whose side is Tom on?
250214,eng,My cousin was familiar with trouble when he was young.
3591716,eng,That's all I'm thinking about.
3092954,eng,"Link! ""'Sup?"" ""King Harkinian has died."" ""..."" ""What did you say, I died?!"" ""...You died."" ""You dorkface! I'm here talking to you!"" ""...No."" ""What about Ganon?"" ""He died as well! A-ah!"" ""You runt! You haven't seen the last of me yet!"""
7017111,eng,"So when their screams descending fill the strand, / Misenus from his outlook sounds the fray."
2645395,eng,Tom didn't go after all.
6251322,eng,I doubt if Tom will be afraid.
7442192,eng,They were worried they'd get lost.
6399616,eng,"Yet beautiful and bright he stood, As born to rule the storm; A creature of heroic blood, A proud though childlike form."
6432711,eng,Tom has three children from a previous marriage.
3403371,eng,Am I required to get a visa?
2640310,eng,Did Tom say why he wanted to borrow the truck?
4700100,eng,Tom asked that we be quiet.
6497966,eng,Tom and Mary told me they already knew they had to do that.
3223379,eng,"Tom is ugly, but he's really nice."
248909,eng,We have started to recycle newspapers.
56599,eng,This medicine must not be placed within the reach of children.
2247468,eng,I was confused.
6238826,eng,Tom said he wasn't sure he wanted to do that.
901554,eng,I'll have skim milk.
7189373,eng,I assumed that Tom would agree to do that.
5756662,eng,Are you wealthy yet?
2471406,eng,He sounded a little disappointed.
3436592,eng,"Tom couldn't find anything better to do, so he decided to just go ahead and finish his homework."
5790235,eng,Turn down the music before you kill us all.
2254014,eng,It's late and I'll have to be getting along.
2244654,eng,Isn't Tom magnificent?
2214690,eng,Could you please take a picture?
7222301,eng,I'm fairly certain we can do that.
6710888,eng,I've had it up to here with you.
5850768,eng,How did you get interested in wine?
6493436,eng,Maybe Tom and Mary don't know they're not supposed to help John do that.
257819,eng,I retired last year.
6229604,eng,I don't think Tom will be finished doing that by 2:30.
2542756,eng,Tom wishes to speak with you.
3045651,eng,Tom has had special training in this field.
6110544,eng,Is there anything that will make him happy?
7508188,eng,I didn't know that Tom would permit me to do that.
477364,eng,What hurts the most is that you didn't feel you could tell me the truth.
5725254,eng,We've all been together since middle school.
7474354,eng,They aren't as innocent as they seem.
2331601,eng,I had a lot of fun last weekend.
3177851,eng,When's the last time you slept?
7436254,eng,"Tom and Mary said that they're planning to go, too."
2544790,eng,I'm going out for a drink.
6732165,eng,These pancakes are awful.
306332,eng,"They have, among them, ruined our plan."
5513640,eng,Tom went to Boston to meet someone.
7520049,eng,Tom said that you looked great.
7095009,eng,He lies!
2477054,eng,Learning English isn't difficult.
3023406,eng,Tom probably knows what Mary is planning to do.
6420270,eng,"Mary likes Tom, but he doesn't like her."
54880,eng,It'll be a waste of time if we wait for them any longer.
2210887,eng,Why don't you sit right there on the couch?
3644710,eng,I am not coming because I am ill.
240165,eng,I want it tapered in the back.
4529452,eng,The answer was pretty astonishing.
6493979,eng,Tom and Mary needed to go back to their house to get their passports.
903848,eng,I think it's time for me to leave for school.
1747340,eng,These boys often play in the little streets.
6728562,eng,I didn't know that Tom wanted to do that on Monday.
5909909,eng,I'm not likely to be there tonight.
684008,eng,Do you ever happen to snack between meals?
1079123,eng,Here's your bag.
6260972,eng,I have to take out the garbage.
268016,eng,The boy passed the examination with success.
6273520,eng,Tom enjoyed doing that.
7152957,eng,Tom wanted to visit Australia.
6267258,eng,Who was here this morning?

6944121,eng,I've written down Tom's phone number.
7510308,eng,I didn't know that Tom was a basketball player.
6211672,eng,"The King's son, who was told that a great princess, whom nobody knew, had come, ran out to receive her."
6235281,eng,Tom would've done that if he'd had the chance to.
3447129,eng,Tom has got to be here someplace.
2016824,eng,Do you still want to give me a hug?
58217,eng,I'm about tired of this quiet life.
2203691,eng,We're going.
260801,eng,I pledged my loyalty to him.
3470140,eng,The killing of the innocent villagers was ordered by the evil dictator.
6874020,eng,Tom must have been thrilled.
3917981,eng,I want you to follow them.
3200118,eng,I told you I'm not going.
1427163,eng,The people of the village built a wooden bridge across the river.
23035,eng,We had a good opinion of your son.
1079082,eng,He still has not written the letter.
6353177,eng,Tom thinks Mary will be able to get home by herself.
7435933,eng,Tom was the only reporter on the scene of the crime.
323067,eng,What do you say to doing the sights of Tokyo tomorrow?
39265,eng,Even a small sound from the TV interferes with my concentration.
2649063,eng,You need to go.
5373768,eng,A strange beast is roaming through the woods.
6530251,eng,Tom is going to lose everything.
3725183,eng,You've got to let me get a message to Tom.
2258280,eng,He couldn't find the house.
7384348,eng,She asked me not to help her.
7286896,eng,Sami was in the loft area where he had his computer.
6927525,eng,Has your father ever been to Africa?
6657563,eng,I told Tom not to believe everything he read on the Web.
2406678,eng,I still say we should've helped Tom.
6512061,eng,Tom and Mary aren't sure what else they can do.
2253251,eng,He was framed on a murder charge.
290033,eng,He had various experiences.
6237553,eng,You need to keep Tom from doing that again.
296326,eng,He studied for ten years.
308425,eng,It happened that I was present when she called.
2288219,eng,You seem to be in love.
4529087,eng,I ran into Tom this afternoon in the supermarket.
6525529,eng,Both Tom and Mary are still in good shape.
4079998,eng,Nothing's been changed.

5734467,eng,Tom turned out to be innocent.
7169772,eng,I think that Tom could teach Mary how to drive.

6029204,eng,I've heard his jokes many times already.
6556070,eng,I was raped!
6157155,eng,I want to become a mechanic.
1093296,eng,Tom likes eating raw oysters.

20231,eng,You must not violate the regulations.
4014822,eng,Why did you become a lawyer?
300339,eng,He went to Narita or somewhere.
6873309,eng,I'm taller.
6125359,eng,Tom is going to try to do that this afternoon.
6647357,eng,Tom told everybody he was motivated to do that.
6653266,eng,Tom said that he needed to help Mary do that.
3590978,eng,That could be anything.
7172099,eng,I thought that you were supposed to doing that right now.
6716144,eng,I'm looking for full-time employment.
5894435,eng,Aren't you going to introduce me?
3043462,eng,Did you tell Tom about tomorrow's meeting?

5980980,eng,It is important to promote our language in every possible way.
6259419,eng,Tom doesn't think you can do that.
3841932,eng,Tom was involved with the management of the company.
5441498,eng,There's no need to add wood to the campfire.
7252410,eng,Sami got his dog back.
7437713,eng,Tom and Mary said they felt guilty.
6604282,eng,"About 85% of the California coast experiences active erosion due to natural, and anthropogenic causes."
1923701,eng,Tom asked Mary to help him reformat the hard disk.
462824,eng,The money is on the table.
5937109,eng,I almost always get home before 5:30.
6365935,eng,You have just boosted my self-esteem.
5000864,eng,It's very upsetting.
2007659,eng,Let's make this quick.
7170239,eng,I think that Tom will be absent.
6422634,eng,"Mary is really successful, isn't she?"
553681,eng,The book was split along its spine.
2253748,eng,This one's mine.
6247910,eng,It doesn't look like you're prepared.
7513709,eng,I thought that you expected me to do that.
6261260,eng,I didn't want to sing anymore.
2644856,eng,Tom may never walk again.
7284838,eng,I'm the only one who knows your secret.
6334951,eng,Tom told Mary that he wasn't willing to do that.
6413551,eng,Mary is going to do that the way you told her to.
4424565,eng,Did you bake a cake?
4597362,eng,She was secretly pleased.
6510856,eng,Tom and Mary looked like they were disappointed.
6508879,eng,I knew Tom and Mary weren't going to do that.
1142362,eng,I hope the interview would be of profit.
1671934,eng,Buy or die!
55304,eng,"You can have either of these, but not both."
5807172,eng,Tom burned a hole in his coat.
5608957,eng,I don't know your reasons for not liking Tom.
2957256,eng,Tom is still in Australia.
7508085,eng,I know Tom could've done that without Mary's help.
5541772,eng,Tom was very afraid of Mary.
6271868,eng,Tom still teaches French.
3832042,eng,My appointment is at 2:30.
6087964,eng,I think Tom needs to be shown how to do that.
6493486,eng,Tom and Mary thought they were going to earn a lot of money doing that.
5922175,eng,This language sounds beautiful.
6530604,eng,I wasn't expecting Tom to come.

269125,eng,The company asked the bank to loan them some money to buy new machinery.
7378432,eng,"Mary is a good bassist, isn't she?"
6399839,eng,Tom always pays his credit card bill in full at the end of the month.
6795011,eng,Tom and Mary have to leave today.

3908404,eng,I have something to tell them.

2476778,eng,"If Mary gives you any advice, take it."

7388897,eng,He's drying his face with a towel.
1429458,eng,I fell in love with a woman.
2663415,eng,This problem affects us all.
3504215,eng,Tom was incredibly bored.

6511544,eng,Tom and Mary said they'd still like to do that.

7177723,eng,Tom said that Mary wanted to do that as soon as possible.
5917195,eng,He is still sleeping.
3822914,eng,Am I in love?
7259184,eng,Sami is going to handle this himself.
7113842,eng,I got off with a fine.
6240307,eng,I've been having fun hanging out with you.
5742495,eng,I'm on leave.
307344,eng,They forced him to sign the letter.
4501341,eng,That's partly true.
6302319,eng,I'll be by your side no matter what.
6710138,eng,Sami wasn't a truthful person.
4980157,eng,I thought Tom looked OK.
7391365,eng,He took his place at the table.
242727,eng,"Where do you want to go today? An amusement park, or maybe a movie?"
5904750,eng,I usually eat lunch with Tom two or three times a week.
2264418,eng,They are advertising for a cook.
7396081,eng,He said he walked home yesterday.
2548581,eng,Tom is in the park.
2337255,eng,The tsar was the ruler of Russia.
6426386,eng,Mary wanted to turn herself in.
2318277,eng,I like music.
6500261,eng,Tom and Mary are tired of people telling them what to do.
3915857,eng,Give him some money.
7049397,eng,"While the Coliseum stands, Rome shall stand; when the Coliseum falls, Rome shall fall; when Rome falls, the world shall fall."
2541142,eng,You're a better dancer than Tom.
314798,eng,She takes a bad picture.
4996830,eng,Prime numbers are divisible only by one and themselves.
283037,eng,I know that he'll call with another price increase.
6655920,eng,I don't usually get to my office until about nine-thirty.
6254871,eng,Is there a better way to do that?
6659091,eng,Tom didn't seem to be as determined as Mary seemed to be.
1025297,eng,Tom has three daughters.
2378437,eng,In 2014 Scotland may become an independent state.
72632,eng,Will you notify me after 3 minutes?
6665579,eng,I have a grandson in Boston.
3348265,eng,Terrace farming is widely practiced in the mountainous regions of China.
7139561,eng,I didn't know he was ill.
7733106,eng,Tom is very busy nowadays.
6427340,eng,Mary has everything she wants.
6253301,eng,I need to buy a new pair of shoes.
7736177,eng,"I'll never do that again, I promise."
2642838,eng,We must be ready for anything.
2977964,eng,I bought a telescope in order to observe the night sky.
6104583,eng,Aren't you going to see Tom?
5483257,eng,Mary is not a girly girl.
807441,eng,Democrats and Republicans worked together.
1898256,eng,Please tell Tom he can come back after lunch.
6203000,eng,Making artificial flowers is one of my hobbies.
5228495,eng,This method has its pluses and minuses.
3916063,eng,I'll give him a call.
4491055,eng,Tom lied about his grade.
5852246,eng,I told Tom not to believe Mary.
66956,eng,Andy must have practiced very hard.
6003901,eng,We never go out at night.
6117929,eng,You should've been a little more patient.
7287563,eng,Sami was harassing complete strangers.
4198396,eng,I'm a terrible writer.
1029165,eng,Tom doesn't know exactly where Mary lives.
3201151,eng,Tom tells me we have a problem.
6491734,eng,I wonder if Tom and Mary are impressed.
329352,eng,Researchers Identify New Receptor Complex in Brain
7505173,eng,I know that Tom didn't know who didn't want to do that.
5261202,eng,I don't have time to travel.
5732977,eng,I want to grow old gracefully.
7169155,eng,I think that Tom looked happy.
1026170,eng,Tom doesn't have a driver's license.
282263,eng,It is dangerous to fly in this heavy fog.
2892057,eng,That's one of my concerns.
1094964,eng,Tom decided that it wouldn't be beneficial to study French.
7379495,eng,Mary said she would write to us.
7375598,eng,Mary isn't as ugly as she used to be.
7026063,eng,The others laughed.
1682289,eng,This is the first time I've ever fanned myself with a true fan.
6220939,eng,I doubt if Tom will be mad.
5902126,eng,"I'm young, but I'm not stupid."
320782,eng,Mother has made me what I am.
7174114,eng,I thought that I heard your voice.
7194979,eng,Aren't you going to be in Australia next October?
7144247,eng,I didn't think anybody was satisfied.
6660083,eng,I don't think Tom was honest.
754823,eng,Adopting the new policy was the best thing this company ever did.
2414070,eng,Tom and Mary waited for the elevator together.
7249869,eng,Sami didn't want me to leave.
6663225,eng,"Tom was devastated, but Mary wasn't."
6338272,eng,I wouldn't have done that if Tom had asked me not to.
309488,eng,It is within the bounds of possibility that she will succeed.
505601,eng,We have to show them that it's for real.
3204963,eng,It's too soon to tell whether it's a boy or a girl.
7475295,eng,They say they're studying French.
6274091,eng,I can't do that job.
2646221,eng,What are your reasons?
7117700,eng,"I want to do that, but I don't have any money."
34963,eng,Have you ever been to Hawaii?
6696089,eng,Tom has to brush his teeth.
5679194,eng,Let's send Tom a Christmas card this year.
7516801,eng,I didn't know that I was going to win.
6662785,eng,"Apparently, Tom and I were wrong."
6024748,eng,The guy over there is Tom.
2867965,eng,He will consider this.
5725358,eng,Who would've thought this would happen?
67510,eng,You shall not use this form while speaking American English.
2539795,eng,I'll see what else we need to bring.
5857189,eng,I'll never be able to love you again.
2145666,eng,Do you really want to break my heart?
1029236,eng,Tom died in the evening of the day he and Mary got married.
2882977,eng,Do you support or oppose this idea?
3201521,eng,Please tell Tom that I'll do it.
6251528,eng,I need to do that before I go home.
6072144,eng,Layla fought back.
6526371,eng,Tom and John never discuss their work with their wives.
22247,eng,"It's on the coast about 13 kilometers to the north of its more famous neighbor, Dover."
312968,eng,She is fond of painting a picture.
6438313,eng,Tom decided he needed a change.
3726534,eng,I should've said something earlier.
7269096,eng,We will be very happy if we have another daughter.
4398862,eng,Today I saw a very enjoyable movie.
6260564,eng,I'd come to Boston if I could.
5191959,eng,I'm not going to deny it.
7441499,eng,They'll help you if you ask them to.
3636458,eng,Who would want to do that?
7400114,eng,She looked like she was frantic.
3249257,eng,She likes working hard.
6263569,eng,Your fever is getting worse.
3903828,eng,You don't have to go with us.
931364,eng,"Yep, I understand. Thanks a bunch."
803063,eng,He suffered from health problems.
7390921,eng,He shut off his computer.
4789402,eng,Please go ahead without me.
7126655,eng,My answer may surprise you.
7510524,eng,Tom doesn't think he can finish the job alone.
1840467,eng,She studied Chinese in order to translate her books into this language.
1332084,eng,Don't treat me as if I were a child.
6698241,eng,Here is a recipe of banana caramel that can replace Nutella advantageously.
7475561,eng,They say they're planning to go.
7264010,eng,Sami found Layla's journal and read it.
6365505,eng,Sami is out of control.
3183511,eng,"Unless you can speak French, they won't understand you."
2410776,eng,He knew intuitively that she was lying.
7506530,eng,Tom doesn't know Mary will be at his birthday party.
7191993,eng,I doubt Tom will go to Australia.
1027231,eng,Tom added a few finishing touches to the painting.
2496841,eng,You can easily score a MILF in this club.
1475614,eng,I'd like you to be my guest tonight.
42985,eng,That leaves no room for doubt.
3132918,eng,It's going to happen again and again.
7175358,eng,Tom thought that Mary wasn't nervous doing that.
307275,eng,They live in a sunny house.
7137613,eng,Sami said he was attacked by an octopus.
6338246,eng,I don't think Tom has to get up so early tomorrow.
6527561,eng,Tom is looking for a man named John Jackson.
6531884,eng,Tom says he didn't swim.
2703353,eng,He suppressed his anger.
1582671,eng,"Farewell, Cuba."
5767597,eng,I'm sick and tired of this.
312996,eng,She was noted for her good looks at school.
6872743,eng,Don't ask me to explain.
6503165,eng,Tom and Mary admitted that they didn't know what to do.
7542762,eng,Tom has been bedridden for some time.
2734265,eng,He worked until late at night.
3619192,eng,Tom was almost dead when we found him.
69344,eng,Do you want to see our English lesson?
304376,eng,He turned to his friends for help.
3823234,eng,Did your father hug you much when you were a kid?
5663104,eng,I finally understand what Mary was trying to tell me.
2798718,eng,I'm having an extremely hard time with my wife.
515401,eng,Indonesia consists of many islands and two peninsulas.
7504960,eng,Tom said that he thought he'd have to do that tomorrow.
6474516,eng,Sami developed a relationship with Layla.
5213901,eng,I want you to make a decision.
7231704,eng,I don't think that it's important.
1223644,eng,I'll visit Mr. Brown's house tomorrow.
2547845,eng,I'll find Tom myself.
6356247,eng,I'm married to a nurse.
3728616,eng,It was an awkward moment.
3330263,eng,I don't have time to talk to you now.
6775478,eng,Tom repairs his bicycle.
3820041,eng,I have confidence in them.
5109515,eng,Tom bought some supplies.
7211680,eng,Tom told me that he thought Mary was good-looking.
2276902,eng,That doesn't sound very convincing.
6782436,eng,Aart is seen in this ISIS video inside Syria.
5730896,eng,Tom is trying to keep Mary calm.
6491952,eng,I don't think Tom and Mary are planning to help us.
2197935,eng,He has gone into debt.
4356219,eng,"At the foot of the mountain, the fields stretched far and wide and in these fields the cherry blossoms were in bloom, giving off a sweet scent."
6493624,eng,"I know Tom and Mary are friends of yours, but I still don't like them."
7398573,eng,He said that he wasn't unhappy.
6098987,eng,They want to destroy linguistic diversity.
2973331,eng,It's raining hard outside.
2111319,eng,They're cops.
7509611,eng,Everyone here knows Tom speaks very good French.
2647166,eng,Hold it for a second.
6823419,eng,I don't think Tom and Mary are so strange.
7030955,eng,Why don't you sit down? The place is free.
6257749,eng,Tom still refuses to speak French.
3818155,eng,Let Tom do that for you.
7219896,eng,Sami's test was super easy.
7191266,eng,I think we shouldn't let Tom go to Australia by himself.
6357688,eng,We have to eat now.
58937,eng,This watch was given me by my uncle.
4012851,eng,Are you familiar with that?
3905678,eng,I told him I needed some air.
7475537,eng,They're not as old as they look.
7518043,eng,I didn't know Tom wouldn't be there.
2216715,eng,He wants me to help him.
2754360,eng,I'm a member of Alcoholics Anonymous.
1950795,eng,I can't believe I actually thought Tom would change.
761930,eng,She speaks English fluently.
2327228,eng,I found Tom there.
2628981,eng,I took advantage of every opportunity to improve my English.
6646163,eng,Tom was asleep on the sofa.
6353315,eng,Tom told me that he thought Mary was uncomfortable.
6516356,eng,Do you even know who Tom and Mary are?
5573355,eng,Please arrive a bit later next time.
323230,eng,Be sure to drop in to see us tomorrow evening.
6347864,eng,Tom told me he wasn't very hungry.
7191852,eng,I know that Tom is in Australia.
7400668,eng,She told me she didn't do that.
7196885,eng,What surprised me was that Tom didn't seem happy.
6491040,eng,Tom and Mary don't care about anybody but themselves.
6017296,eng,"I am not particularly fond of my enemies, and I don't like my friends very much, either."
7132345,eng,This one is cheaper than that one over there.
2013933,eng,I just want to say I love you.
31618,eng,It will soon be New Year.
6879184,eng,I guess we have no choice.
7230676,eng,I don't think I'm going to do that with Tom.
3822608,eng,Nobody ever believes me.
257649,eng,I like Sachiko better.
2952873,eng,I'm teaching myself to tap dance.
6264136,eng,Tom and I got along really well.
1989614,eng,Did Tom hit you?
5585364,eng,Let me deal with Tom.
3906219,eng,We need to talk to them.
7241403,eng,Sami isn't fooling anybody.
2219736,eng,Why are we even talking about this?
6825844,eng,Why are you shouting like that?
7127627,eng,How can I avoid state taxes if I retire overseas?
5595996,eng,Do you remember what you were going to say before you were interrupted?
6339608,eng,Tom and I couldn't make ourselves understood in French.
3133063,eng,Everything happened really fast after that.
7155521,eng,Tom said that he didn't have to go to Australia next week.
7514636,eng,I know that Tom is a very quiet neighbor.
4030758,eng,On Purim people eat Haman's Ears.
6423233,eng,Mary said she thought you'd do that.
7403990,eng,He told me he was strict.
6423271,eng,Mary said she learned something new.
2959269,eng,It's out of the question for me to leave my job.
1898260,eng,Please send help right away.
318143,eng,What is beautiful is not always good.
3918445,eng,I'm sure I can find them.
307028,eng,They sailed around the world.
6412568,eng,Mary told Tom that she thought John wasn't sleepy.
928761,eng,He was unconscious for three days.
5732586,eng,That's what really angered me.
7735010,eng,I always try to treat people with respect.
6272326,eng,Tom and Mary met three years ago.
5848965,eng,Was Tom taller than you thought?
3311382,eng,I don't need a shoeshine.
7156490,eng,Sami can't explain this story.
7132442,eng,"Tom is doing all he can, isn't he?"
7496999,eng,Weren't you the one who wrote this?
6335210,eng,Tom said he didn't plan on staying for so long.
5529569,eng,The bottle of water is in the fridge.
1255088,eng,Tom ate a crocodile.
37145,eng,Tom is playing the violin now.
3415131,eng,What impressed Tom the most?
4663379,eng,I think Tom didn't understand the question.
270218,eng,The true value of a man does not lie in what he has.
6241185,eng,Tom said he thinks there's no life on Mars.
3203770,eng,I told Tom I'd invite Mary to my party.
1184513,eng,I met your son yesterday and he greeted me politely.
5577229,eng,Tom is quite wrong.
6980496,eng,"Don't look so downcast, Tom."
276562,eng,Everyone recognized him as a brilliant pianist.
7409548,eng,They might think I don't like them.
5955956,eng,Physics is hard.
2544874,eng,I'll do anything you wish.
314465,eng,She showed me around the campus.
5553961,eng,Tom often wears corduroys.
6996555,eng,Mary invited her friends over for a party.
277839,eng,The Asahi Shimbun did not carry that news.
313357,eng,She is not what you suppose her to be.
6411186,eng,Mary admitted she didn't do what we wanted her to do.
7278977,eng,Sami was having a convo with Layla.
2641166,eng,This has to be what we're looking for.
6238845,eng,You have to be finished doing that by 2:30.
7126718,eng,How much did Tom pay you to kiss Mary?
2953859,eng,We'll have to do something about that.
6500276,eng,I doubt that Tom and Mary understand what we're talking about.
7405724,eng,She knew she was wrong.
6528191,eng,Does Tom still go to church every Sunday?
7258804,eng,Sami will tell you the story.
5827727,eng,When had he heard Marilla laugh like that before?
1029322,eng,Tom didn't have the courage to tell Mary the truth.
245371,eng,My work is almost finished.
6664341,eng,Tom gave it a try.
296407,eng,He is not a high school student.
3736297,eng,Tom is supposed to know how to do that.
6527172,eng,I wasn't willing to do what Tom asked me to do.
6255106,eng,Tom says he knows Mary could do that if she tried harder.
2107502,eng,Tom's embarrassed.
6416465,eng,Mary drank a whole bottle of wine by herself.
4934596,eng,Tell me how it went later.
2504764,eng,Those who try to be foolish are foolish.
6505943,eng,Are you sure that's what Tom and Mary were doing?
6825681,eng,Who told you that we wanted to do that?
2255335,eng,You'd never survive.
973622,eng,They met at the estate of the shogun's retainer to play a game of cards.
7504537,eng,Tom has already decided he isn't going to try to escape.
1096461,eng,I plan to throw all of this away. You may take whatever you like.
6046788,eng,Look up.
5597983,eng,I bought this TV from Tom.
388021,eng,The boy is wearing glasses.
2648808,eng,I'm quite hungry.
275326,eng,Idleness often accounts for poverty.
6675840,eng,I suspect that Tom is upset.
6687967,eng,I'm not too young to do that.
7120201,eng,There Tom goes.
1895745,eng,You have nothing to worry about.
6123555,eng,Tom carries a harmonica with him all the time.
57515,eng,The lid of this box won't lift.
5707161,eng,We don't always sing this many folk songs in one night.
2245498,eng,Finish your drink.
6578850,eng,Tom read the contract in secret.
7508718,eng,I know Tom didn't know he didn't have to do that.
72990,eng,I have a few minutes to spare.
4267069,eng,Try this!
4853227,eng,Tom is intellectually gifted.
28590,eng,Is it getting worse?
6378972,eng,Sami made Layla an offer too good to refuse.
6424112,eng,Mary knows she should do that soon.
3269181,eng,A storm is going to batter Brittany in the coming hours.
3127979,eng,"You're not suggesting Tom could have done it, are you?"
6102360,eng,Don't you two get along well?
4027706,eng,"When you are meeting a girl, you have to act confident."
7404555,eng,She told me she was alone.
2891603,eng,It's not going anywhere.
6689793,eng,I'm not planning on doing that by myself.
5839672,eng,Fadil was convicted of one count of murder.
6510971,eng,I don't know where Tom and Mary have to go.
320296,eng,Wait for a second chance.
6508058,eng,Did Tom and Mary say how they were able to do that?
2546188,eng,I told you to stay back.
3914683,eng,I never hit you.
281689,eng,The prices of Japanese automobiles are still comparatively high.
7142915,eng,I think that you shouldn't gone there.
2406788,eng,Plants in the environment help slow down the process of erosion.
2271401,eng,Don't you understand that?
4663756,eng,The boss wouldn't let us go home early.
5858670,eng,I got distracted.
63546,eng,The chameleon can take on the colors of its background.
257387,eng,I want to live a happy life.
6241352,eng,I didn't want Tom to think I was a wimp.
1300094,eng,One should treat his teachers with respect.
5991284,eng,His playing is mediocre.
3738094,eng,How many beers did you drink?
6339817,eng,I wasn't able to do anything because it was raining.
2835670,eng,You're supposed to be relaxing.
3818705,eng,Tom wondered who the man standing near the gate was.
3824322,eng,Isn't winning great?
3626046,eng,"Tom nervously checked the text messages on his phone, fearing that he might have sent inappropriate images or texts when he was drunk the night before."
6902695,eng,"Tom is wearing red, isn't he?"
3171537,eng,Tom found a good place for me live.
2541714,eng,Tom didn't know what was wrong.
5036618,eng,"Welcome, everybody."
7219098,eng,Sami and Layla are both drunk.
7444061,eng,Tom and Mary told me they'd lied.
6507254,eng,I don't know what Tom and Mary do for a living.
1466927,eng,He always swims with the current.
3250927,eng,"I want something to happen. ""Like what?"" ""I don't know."""
3736006,eng,Tom thought that Mary wouldn't be able to beat him at chess.
7404669,eng,She said that she'd leave.
4160479,eng,The teacher lost his job because he cruelly berated students who made mistakes.
7521997,eng,I know Tom is lucky.
16832,eng,You should by all means read the book.
6527702,eng,Tom said that Mary wasn't enjoying herself.
2042722,eng,Are you saying you don't want to help us paint the ceiling?
293850,eng,"He opened the drawer, and took out a letter."
6268961,eng,Let's go to Boston again.
7453392,eng,Tom vouched for Mary.
6048710,eng,Does Tom have to pay for everything?
4154926,eng,Why isn't anyone helping Tom?
303631,eng,He showed his mother around the city.
567956,eng,"Anyone who really wishes to apply themselves to the freedom of mankind must have the courage to face the truth, regardless how bitter it may be."
7436887,eng,Tom and Mary said they thought I was cute.
7143501,eng,I didn't think that Tom would be willing to help us do that.
6833242,eng,Tom is here for the weekend.
6512347,eng,Tom and Mary waited a while before they began.
5673116,eng,Tom is setting the table.
7194746,eng,I didn't notice that Tom wasn't paying attention.
5913271,eng,Sami muttered something that I couldn't hear.
311063,eng,She thought to the contrary.
5515714,eng,I forgot myself.
6224247,eng,Tom said he doesn't plan on being there.
7378849,eng,Mary rarely eats with her family.
1682727,eng,This is plagiarism.
1216169,eng,What time is the plane scheduled to land?
3920528,eng,I wouldn't worry about them.
2912947,eng,"A mistery is what's not clear. For example, this is a real mistery."
2203580,eng,Tom is wicked.
3024448,eng,Do you have any pictures of Boston?
3961257,eng,Scientists of the 19th century believed that the Sun was powered by chemical reactions.
6350097,eng,"Tom will do that tomorrow, too."
5386973,eng,The instructions are on the package.
6425317,eng,Mary said she'd get home by 2:30.
3884586,eng,Everything in the house seemed to go wrong without a woman to look after it.
7518638,eng,Do Tom and Mary know that I'm here?
7513702,eng,I wish that you hadn't seen me doing that.
1653955,eng,I crossed the dark street.
4519835,eng,She always thought she could get out of it.
6652425,eng,Tom said he thought that Mary would be doing that today.
6344333,eng,Tom didn't seem to like teaching French.
4495145,eng,That was positive.
569778,eng,Christopher Columbus once met the child in Sentence 47456 and opened his eyes to the world.
5195537,eng,He's always here between five and six o'clock.
5165086,eng,Tom bought flowers.
4904185,eng,"It looks like that, huh?"
4663583,eng,Tom's car cost a lot more than mine did.
6659148,eng,Tom became very sleepy.
6491780,eng,I wonder if Tom and Mary are doing that now.
19321,eng,There are many old temples in Kyoto.
4391420,eng,I want to learn Indonesian.
6223980,eng,Tom may know where Mary was last night.
6365889,eng,I've got some more chocolate for you.
7437279,eng,Tom and Mary said that they knew what to do.
3430690,eng,We had to sell the building because for years we had operated it at a loss.
7722436,eng,The last time that I saw Tom was at your place.
7183680,eng,Sami liked this video.
6429123,eng,Mary says she swims well.
4869535,eng,This politician is suspected of having connections to organized crime.
3131076,eng,When is this supposed to happen?
279707,eng,The Tokaido line terminates at Tokyo.
6088112,eng,Tom wouldn't let Mary drive his car.
284349,eng,His broken arm was the result of a slip on the ice.
273851,eng,My grandfather has made me what I am.
3724668,eng,You'll need to hold still.
2044407,eng,I'm really happy.
28041,eng,It is necessary that you see a doctor.
1887724,eng,I think that jacket would fit me.
453598,eng,The following people were put to the test.
3448826,eng,Tom is going to be expecting that.
4495834,eng,The attacker ran away.
7460951,eng,There's nowhere else I'd rather be.
48961,eng,Turn left at the corner.
3627521,eng,Is the poorest country in the European Union poorer than the poorest state in the United States?
1421781,eng,She has the advantage of beauty.
3592239,eng,How do you stand this heat?
3131769,eng,It's obvious what has to happen.
3907124,eng,I never listen to him anyway.
5886852,eng,Fadil turned to Layla for comfort.
6253011,eng,Tom says he believes he can do that.
3264732,eng,Let's come up with a new plan.
7492565,eng,I don't believe in the existence of God.
6511818,eng,I think Tom and Mary aren't in Boston now.
6954707,eng,I like that video game. And only that video game.
6431579,eng,Tom said that Mary would likely be motivated to do that.
250446,eng,My opinion is somewhat conservative.
2545453,eng,I'll share them with you.
260834,eng,I explained the rules of the game to them.
3496895,eng,Tom was found guilty of murder.
2066702,eng,My beloved girl is far away from me.
6411675,eng,Mary had a crush on Tom when she was in high school.
7379695,eng,"Mary is quick-witted, isn't she?"
7112154,eng,I didn't realize who that man was.
3125920,eng,He is handsome.
3658058,eng,A journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step.
6888703,eng,"Leaves and little branches were hurled about, and the thunder was getting nearer."
3717636,eng,Tom won't be singing.
3822799,eng,"Tom is still sitting in his car, waiting for Mary."
7217664,eng,Mary quickly checked her makeup.
7404815,eng,She said she feels better.
7438950,eng,They said that they heard an explosion.
270397,eng,The birds are flying near the people.
7521171,eng,I didn't know Tom was a vet.
7268062,eng,Tom was entranced by Mary's beauty.
7179462,eng,Tom said that he's not hungry.
6567137,eng,Sami was devastated by his son's actions.
6233386,eng,What made Tom afraid?
4429087,eng,"Is he not a man of complete virtue, who feels no discomposure though men may take no note of him?"
6341943,eng,Tom is supposed to be here in thirty minutes.
5544535,eng,I already know what the theme of the radio programme will be.
6428380,eng,I think Mary blames herself.
4278474,eng,It's something I'm proud of.
6942428,eng,"Tom is ready to start, isn't he?"
262166,eng,I will live in Sasayama next year.
6342405,eng,Do you really think Tom was displeased?
7542687,eng,Tom was killed with a poisoned arrow.
6504928,eng,I should do the same thing Tom and Mary are doing.
6357078,eng,Tom and Mary could travel together.
7393403,eng,He knows precisely what he's doing.
3826925,eng,Tom came to see you this afternoon.
3358968,eng,You've got yourself a deal.
68921,eng,Do you study English every day?
473880,eng,I will shoot him.
7475487,eng,They didn't like what they heard.
1027092,eng,Tom asked for a beer.
289675,eng,No doubt he will come.
2645935,eng,Tom canceled his trip.
3914270,eng,Did you kidnap them?
2262796,eng,When will Tom arrive?
58638,eng,I want this letter registered.
7411382,eng,Let me tell you the secret that has led me to my goal. My strength lies solely in my tenacity.
3171215,eng,Tom said he feels a lot better today.
418411,eng,"We suffer primarily not from our vices or our weaknesses, but from our illusions."
6484306,eng,You went to bed.
72029,eng,I'll put his courage to the test.
7213591,eng,Sami doesn't know who those people are.
6654301,eng,Tom said that he didn't want to sing with us.
3185389,eng,Tom stayed here three days last month.
439335,eng,She always wears clothes which are out of fashion.
3477497,eng,Those damnable pigeons have again dirtied my car.
7473461,eng,They shouldn't have done what they did.
2797533,eng,"My older sister gave me an iPhone, but I don't know how to use it."
5105515,eng,My dream is to live peacefully in a village.
4798935,eng,I'll sell the jewelry to customers.
6433599,eng,Tom said that Mary has only done that twice.
1963036,eng,We could see enemy ships on the horizon.
4495445,eng,We've already accomplished a lot.
2275833,eng,I didn't do anything wrong.
6231669,eng,I don't know how to do what Tom has asked me to do.
265996,eng,"If you have written the letter, I'll post it."
3903383,eng,I'll stay with them.
7266039,eng,We will deal with it when it happens.
6474681,eng,Sami loved everything that he did.
7278831,eng,Sami was being serious.
6498043,eng,Tom and Mary say they won't do that unless John helps them.
5725615,eng,That's what unimaginative people do.
1304581,eng,Ten minus two is eight.
4681362,eng,These particular persons will run.
312409,eng,She would often play the piano after school.
6253247,eng,Tom and Mary decided they'd go on a picnic in spite of the rain.
3213897,eng,Tom's a heavy sleeper and didn't hear the intruder smash the lounge room window.
1559538,eng,In my house we drink a lot of beer.
1300132,eng,He built a doghouse with his son on Sunday.
6439208,eng,Tom doesn't think Mary lied.
3846529,eng,There has been a considerable increase in oil prices.
6502603,eng,Tom and Mary said they didn't like chocolate ice cream.
6992068,eng,"Fashion houses around the world are bowing to pressure and using alternatives to real fur amid pressure from animal rights groups and changing tastes of younger customers, who are increasingly aware of the environmental issues linked with the clothes they buy."
5729698,eng,"We were angry, but we'll be OK."
6655338,eng,What time do you think Tom will be here?
7222393,eng,There's hardly any chance Tom will win the election.
6414862,eng,Mary has just told me that she found a new job.
6663096,eng,Which dog is Tom's?
5228514,eng,Is it a horse?
2771523,eng,Where's the men's room?
261696,eng,I said that to please my mother.
3530221,eng,The baby seems to be sleeping soundly.
561021,eng,Only a Sith would appreciate the lack of compromise inherent in a prime number.
1682024,eng,I cannot bite. I have no teeth.
2490803,eng,She has a a tidy apartment.
6432813,eng,How much time did it take Tom to clean his room?
718925,eng,I don't want to go to bed.
313144,eng,She felt sick and sank to the ground.
2271388,eng,Don't you miss that?
7296492,eng,The soldier refused the fight.
55411,eng,This is a story written in simple English.
7215059,eng,Tom was obviously sorry.
7183381,eng,Sami was talking to a crazy person.
305600,eng,They married on Christmas Eve.
3721902,eng,Tom is going to give me a haircut this weekend.
1578004,eng,Tanaka has said that he got up this morning around eight o'clock.
7521060,eng,I know that I'm getting old.
2549300,eng,I'm sure of that.
6581509,eng,The stench of censorship will spell the end of the oligarchy.
6509677,eng,Tom and Mary said that they were really offended.
1686128,eng,The question was obviously unexpected.
2173912,eng,She's a natural.
261046,eng,I was thinking about what she had said to me.
2996298,eng,Tom should date someone closer to his own age.
373225,eng,My mother was a Japanese National Railways station attendant from 1971 until 1987.
602005,eng,I'd like a word with you if I may.
2720683,eng,What do you want to do about supper?
7183524,eng,Sami's neighbors are relatively nice.
3730889,eng,How can you be sure Tom will do what you ask?
280692,eng,A sudden noise abstracted their attention from the game.
302080,eng,He killed himself by taking poison.
619719,eng,"Listen, I think that you are barking up the wrong tree here."
285336,eng,"At his concerts, she screams for him from a distance."
2259341,eng,The loss of their mother grieved them very much.
7081001,eng,Each horse is different.
2949813,eng,However luggage didn't make it back to Toronto.
6250714,eng,Tom says the heat doesn't bother him.
5760227,eng,How should it be done?
3185353,eng,Tom wants you to stay here with us.
3472855,eng,Tom said there wasn't time to do that.
2639921,eng,"You said it was an emergency, so I came right away."
310368,eng,She went to Italy to learn Italian.
2548271,eng,I'm better off here.
6719013,eng,Sami bought Layla hotdog cart.
6416459,eng,Mary had a party at her place Monday evening.
6262682,eng,Tom told Mary that he thought John was tired.
909510,eng,How many hours a day do you spend in your office?
5741204,eng,Tom was subsequently fired.
3447043,eng,Tom Jackson is a teacher at our school.
480965,eng,"Regardless what you may do, the outcome will still be the same."
6230292,eng,I don't think Tom really had to do that this morning.
2645525,eng,Have they said anything?
7381505,eng,Mary told me she's pleased.
2648175,eng,You need to sleep.
2269443,eng,He doesn't listen to his teachers.
3826598,eng,Has Tom eaten anything?
3153879,eng,Did Tom give you any other suggestions?
7405018,eng,He says he's very rich.
6292143,eng,Do not be so vengeful!
265509,eng,"I got injured in the car accident, but it was not anything."
2662615,eng,"This is always going to be a problem for us, isn't it?"
1386862,eng,That was close.
7173809,eng,I thought Tom agreed to do that.
4529871,eng,I'm sure Tom can afford it.
261964,eng,I have a dog trained as a seeing eye dog.
789433,eng,She got all flustered when the boy she likes came over to talk to her.
7444605,eng,They told me they weren't worried.
3905913,eng,Why did you say that to us?
4506174,eng,Mary swims quite fast.
7438534,eng,They said that they'd never hurt anybody.
6709412,eng,"In Greek literature, the Seven Seas were the Aegean, Adriatic, Mediterranean, Black, Red, and Caspian seas, and the Persian Gulf."
7519035,eng,I know Tom expected me to do that.
5852845,eng,I'll go alone.
5767639,eng,This is not good news.
3361829,eng,Do not live in a healthier way than what is right for you.
5725467,eng,I wish I could be convinced otherwise.
6257120,eng,I know that you're conservative.
2498611,eng,The minimum wage is $2.13 an hour.
302448,eng,He is beginning to lose his hair.
6273215,eng,Tom was a great friend.
3202539,eng,Call and tell Tom we're running late.
3730971,eng,"What is it with you, Tom?"
7732701,eng,We're looking forward to seeing you in Boston.
2432317,eng,"No matter how many times I've been shown, I just can't learn how to tie a tie."
60080,eng,This flower makes the room!
5738058,eng,Let's start with leftovers.
3912256,eng,Maybe you'd like to meet him.
7194581,eng,Its obvious that that's a lie.
6226999,eng,Tom told Mary that he didn't think John was faster at doing that than Alice.
2488931,eng,He knew this was wrong.
6429690,eng,Mary has done her best.
4305620,eng,Tom wondered whether it would be hard to find a job in Boston.
3748424,eng,"Why don't you try this? It's delicious, you know!"
5850879,eng,I was dirty when I got home.
73490,eng,I'm wondering how long $100 will carry me.
2875363,eng,In Germany you're a minor if you're younger than 18 years old.
2212253,eng,Why don't you wait till morning?
1757363,eng,She's an excellent brain surgeon.
7377142,eng,Mary said that she's quit drinking.
2890332,eng,We pleaded with Tom not to go there.
3733020,eng,It tasted good to me.
7176251,eng,Tom thinks that some of his friends may do that.
3031997,eng,Many of my friends tried to live on their own but moved back home because of insufficient funds for their lifestyle.
6679158,eng,The gym was empty.
6248797,eng,I'd rather not do that with Tom.
5116929,eng,An eye for an eye.
4286298,eng,I am not a member of the club.
1951351,eng,I can't blame Tom for not waiting.
2958081,eng,Tom seemed to be unable to concentrate.
2740239,eng,Please print only if necessary and recycle.
298864,eng,He carried out all his aims.
6432765,eng,Mary is starting to sound a lot like her mother.
2007457,eng,Let's split the difference.
3434268,eng,Tom is very healthy.
4132878,eng,I'd like to rent a motorboat.
5126572,eng,Tom has an interesting background.
640833,eng,I've never seen a more god-forsaken stretch of desert.
6076672,eng,Tom seems to enjoy teasing Mary.
738578,eng,Your words wound painfully.
45391,eng,The boy mocked his friend for being a coward.
2374755,eng,I knew I could count on you.
7178767,eng,Tom said that Mary is probably still outside.
7409668,eng,They want us to follow them.
6524934,eng,Tom and Mary both want to stay in Boston for another week.
6870869,eng,What would have happened if Tom had seen us?
3923382,eng,"In fact, this program is pretty interesting."
259653,eng,I cannot dispense with a coat in winter.
1024820,eng,Tom is the perfect father.
7133476,eng,Who will teach me this?
30719,eng,"If it had not been for the map, I would have lost my way."
3113483,eng,Why tell Tom anything?
7258612,eng,Sami hired one cook.
69910,eng,You don't have to get up so early.
1776553,eng,"In American movies, the black guy always dies first."
7445049,eng,Tom and Mary told us about their trips.
1032206,eng,Either be as you seem or seem as you are.
2643486,eng,We almost got there on time.
4016750,eng,Tom leaned back and stared at the ceiling.
284233,eng,We have to stay a decision until he comes back.
3287336,eng,You'd better come up with something fast.
5695398,eng,"Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not his own facts."
4501168,eng,We needed time.
259284,eng,Compromise is abhorrent to me.
328718,eng,"Well then, does everybody know the anime called Mai Hime?"
6430482,eng,Tom is hungry as well.
5937508,eng,You never seem to pay attention.
3723931,eng,I can smell what you're smelling.
7286479,eng,Sami didn't want to worry his mom.
6258935,eng,I know I don't need to do that.
7443877,eng,Tom and Mary told me that they may do that.
7255166,eng,I am a Welsh-speaking actor in a theatre.
7476339,eng,They renovated their houses.
7507712,eng,Tom realized he was badly injured and needed help.
2110148,eng,My wife has cooked a delicious meal.
6426179,eng,Mary is still unsure of herself.
2012191,eng,Tom wants to make a deal.
6652110,eng,Tom said he wanted to make sure we didn't make the same mistakes he did.
3826452,eng,Let's send them all away.
6583447,eng,I need a new pillow case.
3024379,eng,How long does it take to get to Boston from here?
6269571,eng,Tom said Mary regretted what she did.
4530038,eng,Everyone seems to agree.
5034403,eng,The boy was speechless when talking to a girl.
5132117,eng,Don't read the letter in front of everyone.
5298449,eng,Tom's family liked it in Boston.
6347212,eng,I read the newspaper every morning.
6807249,eng,Sami was extremely blessed that nothing happened to him.
3436751,eng,I hope I make a good first impression.
253350,eng,I like curry and rice.
3573723,eng,Are you stalking me?
2956620,eng,Tom ditched the murder weapon.
6056415,eng,In old age time passes quickly.
6266484,eng,I don't usually wear socks.
1682031,eng,"I cannot claw my owner, said the cat."
5105759,eng,Tom is a decent guy.
1068374,eng,United we stand.
5513517,eng,Tom was paid thirty dollars an hour.
1768860,eng,She'll rip my head off.
1300330,eng,"Whether we win or lose, I won't have any hard feelings."
6521709,eng,Why are Tom and Mary out here?
2776272,eng,She lied about her age.
7537881,eng,I don't remember anybody named Tom.
1029616,eng,Tom asked Mary why she was late.
6529530,eng,Tom arrived in Australia on Monday.
6415485,eng,Mary said she hopes Tom will help her do that.
280046,eng,I suggest we adopt flexible tactics for the moment.
315815,eng,She promised her father to be in time for lunch.
5933775,eng,This is a vernacular.
2011695,eng,I wanted to thank you.
6656072,eng,Tom said Mary didn't look so busy.
6339615,eng,I really want to know why Tom didn't do that.
1727708,eng,Tom teaches German to immigrants.
7286276,eng,Sami asked Layla to send him pictures.
5848551,eng,We should consider Tom's suggestion.
6649216,eng,Tom said that he thought he might not be allowed to do that by himself.
2252256,eng,"Ladies and gentlemen, we are now ready to begin the voir dire."
6691270,eng,Sami's cheating fueled Layla's rage.
7453173,eng,Tom is pretty weak.
699960,eng,"A warm, lazy breeze wafts across the flat, endless fields."
6693385,eng,I'm not really planning on doing that.
1024702,eng,Tom isn't feeling well.
6236952,eng,We have until October to finish this project.
6635055,eng,Tom dropped out of college and became a truck driver.
3203576,eng,It is gone now.
5651258,eng,I love beer.
7538886,eng,Tom and Mary still live in the apartment above John and Alice.
7511373,eng,Tom didn't know you weren't planning to stay.
7238008,eng,Sami had a big car.
6920700,eng,"Fossil of plants, invertebrates, vertebrates, and trace fossils have been identified in Yellowstone National Park from more than 40 stratigraphic units spanning more than 540 million years from the Cambrian to the Cenozoic eras."
1929750,eng,"That sound annoyed me at first, but now I've gotten used to it."
3149122,eng,"A trial is a formal inquiry designed to prove and put upon record the blameless characters of judges, advocates and jurors."
245204,eng,The sands are running out.
2275847,eng,I didn't find anything new.
2712765,eng,"You're not really a teacher, are you?"
6366011,eng,Let me copy it.
7475591,eng,They say they aren't sleepy yet.
6126290,eng,I know you probably want some help.
7140965,eng,Sami needs a gun.
6263087,eng,I don't like studying French.
271132,eng,It is high time we thought more about the damage to the world's climate.
2959022,eng,Tom got angry when Mary referred to his friend in that tone.
7230839,eng,I don't think that Tom really has time to help.
2235472,eng,Why is everyone looking at us?
7131382,eng,I think Tom will agree to let Mary do that.
6228722,eng,Let's go to Boston with Tom.
7231192,eng,I don't think that Tom knows what he wants.
6432359,eng,It's probably going to be easy for you to do that.
72774,eng,Advance two steps.
30030,eng,School starts in September in Europe.
682217,eng,The tragic mistake affected many people.
6918842,eng,"These shoes are big enough for you, aren't they?"
5736321,eng,We actually talked about it.
1248077,eng,What is happening at the present time in the dispute over place-name signs in Carinthia is grotesque.
2642921,eng,Tom is almost fully recovered.
4999864,eng,I'm really happy with that.
803320,eng,He denounced all forms of dishonesty in government.
327676,eng,We reached our destination just as I thought the car was going to give up the ghost.
1629913,eng,Invite her over to watch a movie.
7541985,eng,Tom doesn't like watching dubbed movies.
279617,eng,In the winter I wear a coat on top of my vest.
7421712,eng,Mary had the time of her life.
7517418,eng,I knew Tom knew who did that for you.
6240300,eng,Tom has been here for just over three years.
282538,eng,Keep off the flies.
847724,eng,"Well, have you decided yet?"
2662139,eng,I don't want to meet anyone for a while and I don't want to go outside either.
5189203,eng,Tom and Mary used to be good friends.
7199268,eng,Sami had a really cool name.
70639,eng,Just go about your business and don't keep looking at me.
3903702,eng,I'm not in love with her.
1890842,eng,I'd die without you.
6033307,eng,Do we have to do all this?
314008,eng,She read the children an amusing story.
6255319,eng,Tom doesn't know why Mary and John don't like each other.
1055125,eng,I undertake to do that.
3228534,eng,"Is he alive or dead? ""He's dead."""
6255389,eng,Tom should've never gone to Boston.
407322,eng,The situation in Kyrgyzstan is a real mess.
2044560,eng,You've never been happy.
3573708,eng,That's a good sign.
6496151,eng,I think Tom and Mary will like the present you bought for them.
7520267,eng,I know Tom is a little worried.
3912985,eng,I'll try to be more like them.
5155352,eng,I'll stay in Rome for three days.
6148266,eng,They selected the world's best artists to paint the wall.
3123386,eng,Would you like to know how I did that?
2064818,eng,I can do something about that.
6405456,eng,Sami said that the matter was extremely urgent.
6224636,eng,Tom has decided that he'll try to do that.
46671,eng,"I fainted from the heat, and when I came to, I was in a life raft."
7199793,eng,I promise that I'll take good care of your dog.
5222812,eng,I just waxed the floor.
5834702,eng,Tom knew he couldn't stay.
1961592,eng,I thought you already have a job.
2017406,eng,Music can be defined as the art of producing emotion by the combination of sounds.
1961719,eng,I thought you wanted to talk to me.
6650837,eng,Tom said that he'd fill out the application form for me.
5412625,eng,It's possible that that'll happen.
675438,eng,Strive to simplify everything.
32657,eng,I am still keeping up my tennis craze.
3732528,eng,They'll be well paid.
7287842,eng,Layla has a guy that she's talking to at school.
2408235,eng,I think Tom forgot his camera.
6247624,eng,Tom doesn't have to do that by himself.
255720,eng,I introduced Mary to my parents.
6246689,eng,I found the wallet I thought I'd lost.
3735554,eng,They got drunk together.
3170960,eng,You told me to do that.
246097,eng,A healthy child can no more sit still than a puppy can.
5748182,eng,We never saw Tom again.
3619314,eng,I recommend that you don't do that again.
6915691,eng,"That didn't surprise you, did it?"
7176353,eng,Tom knows you aren't ready.
68023,eng,That Prof.'s talk is driving me up the wall.
7110856,eng,I think that Tom is different.
6665280,eng,I don't think Tom was hurt.
7242375,eng,Sami was waiting for the technician.
4889720,eng,How did this effect you?
6979861,eng,"If you live in California, learning French is impractical."
7235859,eng,I don't think Tom has to do that right now.
3721829,eng,"You know the trouble with you, Tom, you're just stupid."
34658,eng,A man may be wrong; so may a generation.
7514562,eng,I know that Tom used to be a disc jockey.
2211131,eng,"You've never been here, have you?"
2544204,eng,I'm getting a little drunk.
7143115,eng,I'm assuming Tom will do that.
6407651,eng,Mary said she thought Tom might not be allowed to do that again.
3330968,eng,You made me proud.
323638,eng,I see an old woman under the tree.
3919344,eng,Who could blame us?
7278845,eng,Sami is not twenty-one and can't drink.
3911230,eng,You've certainly outdone him.
6580458,eng,My robot won't stop beeping.
6512398,eng,Why weren't Tom and Mary able to do that?
5229844,eng,"In Wales, we have a saying."
2092495,eng,Did anybody see what happened?
5360467,eng,Can you zip up my dress?
3619194,eng,Tom wanted me to ask Mary if she liked him.
4895582,eng,Taiwan was hit by a powerful earthquake.
3439492,eng,How did you manage it?
265622,eng,Reckon the cost before you decide to purchase the car.
6790040,eng,Have you already eaten something?
296819,eng,He took no photos of the festival.
2892377,eng,Tom was a public servant.
7732030,eng,Tom is lighter than all of his friends.
2254638,eng,Where's my father?
7433927,eng,"Father omnipotent Eternal who does sustain the spiritual life of man,what say ye to a man who mentally destroys a woman. He is no man at all!"
6265384,eng,Tom spent a lot of time talking with Mary.
4494295,eng,Are you actually serious?
6501878,eng,Find Tom and Mary and tell them to come here right away.
4009555,eng,Dan distanced himself from Linda's family.
4869690,eng,Precisely at nine o'clock came the Princess in the carriage with four horses.
2969103,eng,The murder scene was still a hive of police activity several days after the man's body had been discovered.
27308,eng,"Generally speaking, savings are increasing."
5704959,eng,I dropped out of high school when I was sixteen.
5758110,eng,Tom looked sharp.
7186067,eng,I'm sorry that I wasn't able to help you.
6604402,eng,There are five people in our family.
7206272,eng,Layla is not a virgin.
6396697,eng,Sami will be fifteen in just a few days.
7190202,eng,Sami's dog is distracting us.
6415945,eng,Mary wasn't as angry as I expected her to be.
7737383,eng,Who is the person sitting next to Tom?
535061,eng,The finger approaches the tip of the nose.
300048,eng,He had the kindness to help me with my work.
1856742,eng,There are only 25 days left to the event!
7508084,eng,I know Tom didn't know I shouldn't have done that.
1246489,eng,"I saw some English female soldiers in yesterday night's news reel. For some, you couldn't tell whether it was a man or a woman, but the majority were rather feminine, and it didn't feel that grotesque."
5958370,eng,Tom thought Mary would be back soon.
1758326,eng,All roads lead to Elsinore.
7470926,eng,Tom and Mary talked as if they knew everything.
4615496,eng,"Here at Tatoeba, we have documented Tom's life from cradle to grave in meticulous detail."
3820540,eng,I have to stretch.
6352293,eng,Tom doesn't think we can win.
516622,eng,This book is mine.
7539811,eng,Tom seems to be having trouble making up his mind.
20298,eng,"Not being well, she stayed home."
3651043,eng,"Heavy-duty vehicles (commercial trucks, vans, and buses) are currently the second largest source of greenhouse gas pollution within the transportation sector."
1225304,eng,The soap irritated my eyes.
6418471,eng,Mary said she's not making a lot of money.
1830381,eng,"If Tom wouldn't eat so much, he wouldn't be so fat."
6469327,eng,A lot of things have changed.
6657637,eng,I wanted to ask Tom how he was able to do that.
2769110,eng,You never called. What's up with that?
6341380,eng,We'll have to ask Tom to do that for us.
1098185,eng,Is he Malaysian?
3991896,eng,I have stopped drinking carbonated drinks.
6563565,eng,Tom was starting to feel a little uncomfortable.
6557613,eng,Is she working in a good place?
805285,eng,Election day was cold and rainy.
1553524,eng,Did you get fired from your last job?
3130469,eng,Come on over.
6709319,eng,Sami and Layla didn't do anything.
2954729,eng,You should be in bed.
6265290,eng,Didn't you know that before?
7540805,eng,Tom began dating Mary about three months ago.
6151842,eng,I gave him two pounds.
6427203,eng,Mary looked like she was done.
6523238,eng,"What? ""Nothing."""
7476755,eng,They opened their books.
5936773,eng,Tom was Mary's first serious boyfriend.
3821579,eng,Have you seen Tom's passport?
7387751,eng,He felt his heart beating faster.
3910808,eng,I'm surprised you remember him.
644633,eng,Cuban cigars are among the best in the world.
7502250,eng,I know that Tom won't admit that he doesn't know how to do that.
6269472,eng,Tom said Mary would do that tomorrow.
1790833,eng,I ate curry yesterday.
6266167,eng,Tom was able to persuade Mary to do that.
3382739,eng,He's dumb and immature.
7321460,eng,Sami ordered wine for us.
7197663,eng,It isn't likely to work.
249210,eng,We aided him in his business.
3311325,eng,New York City is known as the city that never sleeps.
3820304,eng,Maybe we can change that.
6575681,eng,Sami wanted to visit Florida's Atlantic coast.
3921810,eng,Tom looked excited.
7512666,eng,I didn't know that you did that by yourself.
7237652,eng,Sami was glad to hear how dedicated Layla was for animals.
283265,eng,He wouldn't be caught dead playing pachinko.
6517244,eng,I don't think Tom and Mary are awake.
3729711,eng,You should be put away.
6521487,eng,I think Tom and Mary need help.
322239,eng,The truth is that the statement is his personal view.
6728488,eng,I did that while Tom was still asleep.
2047718,eng,Be careful with your choice of words.
6436223,eng,Tom said that Mary ought to do that.
58778,eng,Please take a look at this picture.
6711043,eng,Sami felt a little agitated.
6948157,eng,Tom thinks that Brazil will win the World Cup.
6740515,eng,I've done a lot of very bad things.
5142112,eng,The story of a great flood is known not only from the Bible.
5431165,eng,Tom will notify Mary.
6250232,eng,I informed Tom that I did that.
6898360,eng,I'll lend you my pen.
3729564,eng,We had a very busy day.
3308240,eng,Here's a picture of me.
1750130,eng,What do the papers say?
6497807,eng,I'm sure Tom and Mary wouldn't be forgiven if they did that.
2390798,eng,I really did have a great time.
2732162,eng,I haven't called.
6236645,eng,Did your whole family come to Boston with you?
6416688,eng,Mary won't go away if you don't want her to.
6956494,eng,Why are you turning red?
7237407,eng,Sami was snorting cocaine.
2017744,eng,Like I care!
1095555,eng,Tom can't seem to get over Mary's death.
6306151,eng,Layla was working as a dispatcher.
3823279,eng,Do you think I should quit my job?
6113948,eng,I love my cousin.
6252676,eng,This river dries up in the summer.
1586519,eng,The eggs are still hot.
4077313,eng,What'll I find in the box?
285542,eng,His drinking habit is an old one.
6866272,eng,"If you could change one thing about yourself, what would it be?"
254800,eng,I have plenty of time to do that.
4666338,eng,Tom should call a lawyer.
436559,eng,I don't want to raise false hopes.
2323084,eng,I don't think anyone noticed what Tom did.
2275858,eng,I didn't have enough proof.
2044866,eng,I think Tom will be happy to see you.
2712934,eng,It's time you told Tom the truth.
285668,eng,He lives two doors off.
45303,eng,The man charged me with being irresponsible.
6521923,eng,I think Tom and Mary are busy.
7152571,eng,No one wants to go to Australia with me.
3826333,eng,Those girls are beautiful.
5009673,eng,This is a big problem.
1474122,eng,"Because her parents got divorced, the girl had little contact with her father."
6445460,eng,Sami wore his hair long.
6013505,eng,No one is going to tell Tom that he can't do that.
3426096,eng,Tom doesn't need to go to the doctor.
6512650,eng,Tom and Mary said they weren't having any fun.
7289130,eng,Sami didn't want to beg Layla to talk to me.
238959,eng,You should be careful about your health.
2185170,eng,Can you spare some change?
7388357,eng,She's lost her wallet.
4283516,eng,Her father nearly caught her having sex with her boyfriend.
5882997,eng,The nurses kept a close eye on Fadil.
7129934,eng,Tom didn't seem to be as obsessive as Mary seemed to be.
7441178,eng,"Tom and Mary aren't religious, are they?"
7383389,eng,He didn't kill himself.
6254486,eng,Tom doesn't appear to be getting up.
7507900,eng,I know that Tom knew why you wanted me to do that.
2400843,eng,The deeply desire needs to pay most of the price.
6656466,eng,I can't tell the difference between these two wines.
6123398,eng,Tom told Mary why she had to do that.
3651087,eng,"In April 2014, the U.S., U.K., and Germany announced the Global Innovation Lab for Climate Finance, a public-private platform designed to spur private-sector investment in low-carbon, climate-resilient infrastructure in developing countries."
4499116,eng,There's not a whole lot happening here at the moment.
2080940,eng,I can imagine how the stars feel on tour.
2282930,eng,She is very cunning.
6796835,eng,"I have a lot of hens, but I don't have a rooster."
7544853,eng,"If you continue doing that, you'll probably get injured."
5020319,eng,"Let go the appels, boy / or the ‘Jump-on’ will get you / the ‘Jump-on’ is a strong kobold / who brutally punishes the thiefs."
6310712,eng,"Gee, it sure is– ""Enough."" ""I just–"" ""Enough!"" ""How a–"" ""ENOUGH!"" ""But father–"" ""Die."""
298695,eng,He named his dog Popeye.
311480,eng,She stressed that she did it by herself.
7321401,eng,Sami wasn't rich back then.
7386272,eng,She took her clothes off.
50364,eng,The concert was broadcast live.
892388,eng,You're ten years too young to be driving a Lexus.
355951,eng,I am learning Japanese to play mahjong in Japan.
7514693,eng,I know Tom would show you how to do that.
3619236,eng,I don't think it's a good idea for you to hang out with Tom.
2012526,eng,Tom doesn't want to leave.
7376944,eng,Mary and her husband adopted a girl.
7149229,eng,Sami and Layla kept walking.
6495991,eng,Tom and Mary realized they weren't going to be able to do that.
268158,eng,The firemen quickly extinguished the blaze.
7404138,eng,She said that she was busy.
303532,eng,He is a boy of singular intelligence.
7406361,eng,They're doing their French homework.
3920754,eng,This isn't about him.
7111662,eng,Tom doesn't think that Mary will be annoyed.
3826179,eng,What happened to the boat?
6490994,eng,Tom and Mary don't remember doing what everybody says they did.
2549463,eng,Tom leaned back.
7171380,eng,I thought that you said that you worked with Tom.
6912190,eng,How much time did you spend at the zoo?
4664965,eng,Tom has been doing a great job.
2007835,eng,Let's begin again.
4367161,eng,"Stop right there, you criminal scum!"
6824168,eng,Tell me what you ate.
4933258,eng,A people without knowledge is a people without strength.
6255128,eng,Tom was present at today's meeting.
7123054,eng,Tom wasn't quite finished yet.
5504654,eng,You made me lose.
7190324,eng,Sami's smile warmed my heart.
238013,eng,He took the job for the sake of his career but he didn't like it.
4392221,eng,You need to stick to a diet.
4984302,eng,That's not really my job.
25643,eng,The King was assaulted by terrorists.
7243081,eng,Sami got his price estimate.
433992,eng,The surrounding area was very quiet.
2475609,eng,"I drink gluten-free beer, but I don't really like it."
269132,eng,The new bridge is in process of construction.
2835468,eng,The exit is on the right side of the direction of travel.
7182172,eng,Tom said he thought that I seemed impressed.
2006553,eng,There's a fishing lodge near Boston that I often go to.
3022556,eng,I want to complain about the service.
7408620,eng,They've hanged themselves.
306992,eng,They contributed money to the Red Cross.
6870182,eng,Tom would've gone if he could have.
6822234,eng,Do you still think that's all we have to do?
6525603,eng,Both Tom and Mary are good at French.
1536429,eng,"You see, I've got only these two castles, one hundred hectares of land, six cars, four hundreds heads of cattle and twenty racer horses..."
5851947,eng,I'll tell you the whole story.
5743288,eng,This frog has webbed feet.
6657960,eng,This is the hospital where Tom and I were born.
719330,eng,I prefer going to the mountains in summer.
289613,eng,He is a Cicero in eloquence.
6229853,eng,"You know that Tom is the one who did that, don't you?"
6812034,eng,I heard that Tom has spoken to Mary about that.
3570920,eng,The parking lot was located two buildings ahead.
6266943,eng,Your resume is impressive.
908976,eng,At no period of our ancient history does there appear to have been greater attention paid to the culture of the female mind than during the age of Elizabeth and at no time has there existed a greater number of amiable and respectable women.
953289,eng,Have you ever been stuck in an elevator?
6661584,eng,I'm not as bored as Tom seems to be.
7386325,eng,She took off her pack.
248641,eng,We are trying to do away with the old customs.
4822931,eng,The tower occupied a prominent spot on the ridge.
3151308,eng,"Quick, give me that."
3448983,eng,I forgave Tom.
5737323,eng,I felt like I was in church.
7278438,eng,Sami can't stand Layla's daughter.
6514376,eng,I've known Tom and Mary since they were kids.
1398208,eng,Tom is being chased by paparazzi.
7500323,eng,"You do too much K, Tom."
6417678,eng,Mary said that she wasn't going to be late.
47507,eng,The child talks as if he were a man.
2775351,eng,Whose turn is it to give the dog a bath?
7486464,eng,Where did she buy it?
6733416,eng,Sami was there when his mother committed suicide.
7241047,eng,Tom will help you if you ask him to.
3091332,eng,Is Tom still there?
5833174,eng,I just want you to shut up.
5740613,eng,No more words were spoken.
5337485,eng,The British Expeditionary Force was stranded at Dunkirk.
7390544,eng,She put her shirt on a hanger.
6042669,eng,I'd like to report a crime.
2325156,eng,I eat here every day.
2389591,eng,I overheard your conversation.
6501427,eng,"Tom and Mary have been here at least once, haven't they?"
6476431,eng,Sami visited Layla at her dance studio.
3115778,eng,We're not going to let that happen.
7151045,eng,Sami was looking at me like I was crazy.
3170606,eng,Tom noticed a dark blue car parked outside.
7185278,eng,Sami didn't like to sleep alone.
6498914,eng,Tom and Mary don't know what they're supposed to be doing.
5838303,eng,Tom comes to school by car.
49888,eng,The hotel is within easy access of the station.
5068263,eng,Don't put the baby in the bag!
328817,eng,"Even if it was somebody else who made her happy, as long as she is happy, that's fine."
6511855,eng,Tom and Mary know exactly what they have to do.
7198622,eng,The museum that we're planning to go to isn't far from here.
6049333,eng,Can you do that today?
7258595,eng,Sami was stranded in the snow.
2642161,eng,Tom and Mary haven't arrived yet.
6655889,eng,Tom is usually a lot hungrier than Mary.
7264277,eng,Does she smoke?
2265889,eng,Down with the king!
1256594,eng,"With the exception of Jim, everybody came."
6709867,eng,Sami didn't just attract Layla. He attracted other women as well.
6739120,eng,This land is hers.
5747847,eng,Why shouldn't we sing?
3417509,eng,Tom died about a year ago.
5945273,eng,Show me the source code.
6935862,eng,Mary faked her pregnancy.
1736663,eng,He is really competitive when it comes to football.
6331973,eng,"A lot has changed in the past three hundred years. People are no longer obsessed with the accumulation of things. We've eliminated hunger, want, the need for possessions. We've grown out of our infancy."
1595304,eng,Whoever doesn't know a foreign language doesn't know their own.
4493711,eng,They have an agenda.
5347144,eng,I like your books.
3765179,eng,I still think about her.
406243,eng,Did you find the difference between these two photos?
6531868,eng,Tom was good at his job.
5201410,eng,I've been waiting for the bus for half an hour.
57453,eng,This plane flies nonstop to Tokyo.
4404635,eng,Do I wanna know?
6650331,eng,Tom said that he didn't know that Mary wasn't able to swim.
2940642,eng,I owe you all nothing!
6863301,eng,"If anybody calls, tell them I'll be back at 2:30."
6709081,eng,Sami was winning the game.
6565787,eng,Mary is easily influenced.
7160608,eng,Sami heard a male's voice outside.
3342872,eng,You just made my day.
266246,eng,"As the demand increases, prices go up."
35289,eng,The bus was very crowded. I wish I had taken a taxi.
7215143,eng,Sami's sink was yellow.
3249583,eng,May we be made the head and not the tail.
21546,eng,Does school start at eight-thirty?
3905072,eng,We can't trust him.
6494469,eng,Tom and Mary said they knew they might not need to do that anymore.
7152309,eng,Tom told me he intended to go to Australia with Mary.
26561,eng,Too much exercise can do more harm than good.
807092,eng,Douglas did not oppose slavery.
6655432,eng,"I don't know when it'll happen, but I'm pretty sure that it'll happen."
6414254,eng,Mary handed Tom her canteen and he took a drink.
5284127,eng,Why do mosquito bites itch?
6660291,eng,I admit that I've never been to Boston.
7089625,eng,"Fear not this famine – 'tis an empty scare; / the Fates will find a way, and Phoebus hear thy prayer."
7140421,eng,Sami never did that to Layla.
6268937,eng,Mary has long brown hair.
3725027,eng,Don't grow too fond of Tom.
6520540,eng,Tom and Mary promised me they'd do it.
5938644,eng,"Tom is in Boston, isn't he?"
2642475,eng,I know you need some more money.
6228026,eng,I didn't have as much trouble finding a job as I thought I would.
6842823,eng,Tom gave me a lot of money.
3926845,eng,No one suspected.
6650807,eng,Tom said he'd help me get what I needed.
7182674,eng,Tom said that he felt very sleepy.
6648259,eng,Tom said that he thought that Mary would have to do that.
2943070,eng,When was the last time you went to Australia?
5916396,eng,Tom has agreed to do that for us.
2644438,eng,Tom doesn't have red hair.
7515516,eng,Did you know Tom doesn't like chocolate?
6575332,eng,What is her sickness?
2891497,eng,It made Tom sad.
6421521,eng,Mary says she may not have to do that.
1295340,eng,What would life be without hope?
1737645,eng,It goes without saying that he is a superb pianist.
7510608,eng,"In his heart, Tom knew that he'd never return."
7008303,eng,Tom put on his jeans and a T-shirt.
3875870,eng,I didn't know where that came from.
7740247,eng,"Tom is putting on weight, isn't he?"
6415519,eng,Mary said she didn't do what Tom said she did.
4014621,eng,All Tom wants to do is talk about Mary.
5008616,eng,You lying bastard!
5272714,eng,My mother is eccentric.
2956423,eng,Tom did a very foolish thing.
5000005,eng,Why's it our job?
6243985,eng,You shouldn't drink the tap water here.
6422737,eng,Mary didn't tell the man who she was.
7275016,eng,Sami wanted to jump off the balcony.
249875,eng,I didn't understand the meaning of the last line but one.
6328006,eng,Make sure he changes before he enters my house.
3314643,eng,Tom was born in a small town not too far from Boston.
6348092,eng,Tom might walk to school tomorrow.
3730660,eng,How many problems could Tom possibly have?
3200659,eng,I told Tom you already knew.
1905665,eng,He couldn't wait to try out his new surfboard.
1216253,eng,He's collecting various data.
1807619,eng,Stop filming.
6222521,eng,Tom does that more than Mary does.
6788771,eng,You'd better not leave today.
6439001,eng,How much money did you steal?
1994386,eng,He thinks that he can win at the casino.
6428952,eng,Mary lent me her umbrella.
7392215,eng,"He'll come after us, won't he?"
6064986,eng,Would you like some more rice?
2547044,eng,Those aren't my rules.
251886,eng,"If you come across my book, will you send it to me?"
2451419,eng,Tom speaks French as well as you.
6655177,eng,Tom said that he couldn't remember anything.
4815478,eng,We're all disappointed.
296686,eng,"He sat smoking, with his wife sewing beside him."
3565054,eng,Are you teasing me?
7475785,eng,They say they're not giving up.
2542228,eng,Tom knew what the problem was.
3395915,eng,What kind of place is this?
1122383,eng,"It's hard for me, reading letters on the monitor."
5248825,eng,Grass now grows on the path that once led to the church.
3820163,eng,Tom didn't say anything about that.
6114583,eng,Sami was a heroin addict.
2208357,eng,They aren't alone.
7136972,eng,"You realize Tom won't do that, don't you?"
4097550,eng,The more the better.
1341399,eng,I'd be happy if you'd come.
3434379,eng,There seems to be only one way out of here.
4208064,eng,Do you play any instruments?
6273496,eng,Tom had a nice suit on.
306813,eng,They went to Chicago by car.
7117864,eng,Tom offered to give me money.
7521532,eng,I know Tom did that right.
6506634,eng,Do Tom and Mary still go to Boston every summer?
6512280,eng,Do Tom and Mary think that's what we want?
5288477,eng,Does Tom still play the guitar?
2538287,eng,Everyone but Tom seemed to enjoy the party.
6088548,eng,It's OK if the teacher makes fun of you.
270459,eng,People were anxious for news of missing relatives.
3916517,eng,I gave her a ride.
1911891,eng,I want to live in the same neighborhood where Tom lives.
3137079,eng,"We do not believe in immortality because we can prove it, but we try to prove it because we cannot help believing it."
7112978,eng,I wasn't able to take care of Tom.
4181266,eng,"You know her name, don't you?"
5835959,eng,This clinic is much bigger than the one I used to work at.
4803251,eng,Tom didn't break his promise.
4640848,eng,I'm sure that I'll win that tennis match.
6522907,eng,Tom and Mary kept their balance.
3912865,eng,This isn't like him.
6101384,eng,Sami was the one who set all of this up.
319818,eng,Easter is near at hand.
6302395,eng,Sami was a damaged child.
2543476,eng,I'm supposed to be on break.
6900086,eng,I hope that will not happen again.
6910186,eng,I don't know anything about that guy.
6524122,eng,I wonder whether or not Tom is unmarried.
5852111,eng,Is doing that difficult?
541512,eng,Do you like your new job?
7149614,eng,Who did Tom say was going to go to Australia with him?
7130095,eng,Tom knows how painful a sprained ankle can be.
1106922,eng,"In Japanese folklore, bakeneko are cats with magical powers."
2449405,eng,She twirled her hair.
5953412,eng,No one who is a decent human being could possibly support this project.
6038073,eng,I doubt she knows what she's talking about.
70674,eng,"Your idea is, as it were, a castle in the air."
7383053,eng,He likes to go fishing by himself.
3915017,eng,I just want to help her.
3376771,eng,Understood why I am opposed to women on the tatami?
2456025,eng,We're not terminating you.
6348099,eng,I wonder whether Tom will cry.
7476051,eng,They look like they might cry.
3684884,eng,I have high hopes for you.
7211867,eng,Tom told me that he thought that Mary was responsible for what had happened.
6245648,eng,You should tell Tom you'll do that.
3732718,eng,I guess Tom was just trying to be nice.
7438479,eng,They said that they enjoy teaching French.
6425283,eng,Mary said that she was depressed.
6517449,eng,Why don't Tom and Mary want to stay?
7185018,eng,Sami's lizard was making a strange noise.
6337704,eng,I don't care if we do that or not.
397190,eng,Would you please close that window?
7400441,eng,He admits that he wasn't sure.
7177032,eng,Tom said that no one was there.
6234221,eng,I didn't think Tom was interested in doing that.
7246674,eng,Sami had a friend who was a girl.
5132159,eng,What did Tom write about?
6125781,eng,Tom will get in trouble if he doesn't do that.
2640499,eng,We're about thirty minutes behind schedule.
7380764,eng,"Mary isn't a Canadian, is she?"
269407,eng,"According to the paper, there was an earthquake in Mexico."
293081,eng,Has he returned yet?
6705518,eng,It took me a lot longer to do that than I thought it would.
6711618,eng,Sami was serving a sentence of 26 to life.
2571493,eng,I was distressed to see Tom so unhappy.
47538,eng,He made no progress in his speaking ability.
7206210,eng,Sami was super nice to Layla.
7475759,eng,They aren't as old as they look.
6938306,eng,Say it in the least amount of words?
4012118,eng,Don't you want to go with us?
6666279,eng,Tom grew up on this ranch.
6454712,eng,Sami stopped by to bring something special for Layla.
2271378,eng,Don't you hear that?
7509689,eng,Tom told me he had some things to take care of.
5205179,eng,Tom looks really good to me.
6495018,eng,Tom and Mary told John they wouldn't do what he asked them to do.
3091202,eng,"Yesterday, I got a call out of the blue from Tom."
7318718,eng,He's making fun of us.
6258170,eng,Who does this camera belong to?
244938,eng,Murder is a wicked crime.
2954648,eng,You never cease to impress me.
5368430,eng,Try to control your temper.
288870,eng,He barely missed being killed in the accident.
2538729,eng,I'll listen to anything you have to say.
3727611,eng,This is a waste of your time and your talents.
5610344,eng,We probably don't have enough money.
1827245,eng,It was easy for you to find a taxi.
823465,eng,Kill it with fire!
1741896,eng,Don't let him scream.
2891381,eng,I expect Tom won't want to do that.
7732891,eng,I'm going to study French this evening.
7382250,eng,Mary says she'll win.
3199885,eng,Tell me you'll do it.
1640979,eng,"God gave you a penis and a brain, but only enough blood to run one at a time."
6223950,eng,Tom is going to eventually be able to do that.
263007,eng,We alternated with each other in driving the car.
3133559,eng,I can't believe this is happening to me.
3258822,eng,"Before going to Mexico, I studied Spanish."
6341407,eng,Should I tell Tom that we won't do that?
6327275,eng,José likes latin music.
5737808,eng,They stayed out of the way.
259057,eng,"I met him this day last week, that is, the 25th of June."
464350,eng,We are gray.
1894559,eng,It's too dark.
4121165,eng,We'll do our best to work as quickly as possible.
5832564,eng,You're here early today.
2821365,eng,Tom was wearing a neck brace.
6107285,eng,Layla attached to Sami strongly.
28659,eng,Don't you think it a bad thing?
6083601,eng,The air conditioner was on.
7544120,eng,Tom wasn't so rich back then.
7508561,eng,I know that Tom is the kind of guy who'd do that.
6434116,eng,Are you still working for the same company?
2968770,eng,Tom is very secretive.
2648355,eng,Tom is busy again.
7070311,eng,"Sami doesn't have a family, but he has two dogs."
7212615,eng,Tom told me that he thought that Mary was doing that.
6110485,eng,How will the weather be tomorrow?
6124227,eng,Tom thought he had come up with the perfect plan.
686998,eng,I have accustomed myself to work long hours.
2276361,eng,Tom is in the garden.
1821100,eng,How many passengers can this plane hold?
3150652,eng,My mom bought this shirt for me.
1636207,eng,"On Monday, his condition improved slightly."
6428588,eng,Mary put her boots back on.
2718419,eng,"Sorry, I have to study."
7394789,eng,She pretended that she was a doctor.
785434,eng,It is not necessary for us to attend this lecture.
3402524,eng,Their answer is yes.
6273529,eng,Tom did that yesterday.
2488405,eng,"When I arrived, the dispute had reached its boiling point."
6646107,eng,Tom's parents let Tom stay out late at night.
4824089,eng,"Look, a squirrel!"
5417858,eng,She's in a good mood.
5010235,eng,How can we refuse?
314638,eng,She had her English composition checked by an Englishman.
2955515,eng,Tom also was very sick.
288393,eng,"He was staying in Paris in 1939, when the Second World War broke out."
2643330,eng,Tom and Mary are almost done.
306902,eng,They formed a new political party.
1185317,eng,"It's interesting to observe American politics, especially during a presidential election."
1820885,eng,How many rooms are there in this hotel?
5281810,eng,They ate cheese and crackers.
5937041,eng,You never seemed to enjoy doing that.
6525130,eng,Both Tom and Mary look very uncomfortable.
66195,eng,Come on any day you like.
26959,eng,It's raining hard and yet I must go.
2272816,eng,Tom is a keeper.
7517419,eng,I knew Tom knew who did that for him.
297817,eng,He doesn't live in my neighborhood.
6391162,eng,Sami was growing closer and closer to Layla.
6653468,eng,Tom said he knew that Mary might not be allowed to do that by herself.
292882,eng,He still wants to come.
6806951,eng,Sami's parents live in Cairo.
6319389,eng,Do you want me to give you a massage?
5756746,eng,We were on a break.
2900691,eng,It's almost midnight. Go to bed.
7549019,eng,Could you please speak a little louder?
6657120,eng,I sent a birthday card to Tom.
7507324,eng,I know that Tom doesn't know why I kept doing that.
300661,eng,He made a fool of his teacher.
1164454,eng,Tom lit the oven.
7320692,eng,Sami needs to answert his question.
2255334,eng,You'd love it.
7389678,eng,He knows that it's his call.
6232972,eng,"Tom could possibly be lonely, but I don't think he is."
2407221,eng,I teach French to young children.
3207251,eng,The car veered out of control and ploughed into a group of people at a bus stop.
3247153,eng,Do you know where the hospital is?
4195497,eng,"You met my sister, didn't you?"
7191051,eng,How did you know Tom had never been to Australia?
287497,eng,The way he walks reminds me very much of his father.
1334602,eng,He committed his worst crime on me.
2851865,eng,She needed you.
5505998,eng,God damn it!
6685306,eng,I'm the one who took the bandage off of Tom's arm.
7475344,eng,They say that they'd love to win.
27225,eng,What do you say to taking a rest?
61358,eng,I'm a stranger here.
6576608,eng,We'll make bank.
1730003,eng,I am injured.
6008278,eng,"The princess kissed her friend, crying."
6433929,eng,Tom is probably not going to do that today.
6513094,eng,I don't think Tom and Mary want to leave.
7191183,eng,I told Tom I wouldn't go to Australia.
6225110,eng,Tom thinks Mary would be mad if he did that.
6354888,eng,We shouldn't leave early.
394927,eng,The accident took her son away from her.
7379345,eng,Mary told me that she'd help me.
6230201,eng,Tom didn't tell me he planned to wait until Monday to do that.
6243041,eng,I think Tom won't be here much longer.
6824022,eng,We decided not to do that.
437968,eng,"It's 18th June today, and also Muiriel's birthday!"
2643430,eng,You said you had a question.
887069,eng,She did her best to help him.
6149670,eng,Time is the devourer of things.
7520606,eng,I know Tom decided to do that.
54853,eng,Keep hold of my hand if you're afraid.
7389503,eng,He said that he lost his temper.
6236117,eng,I'd be very grateful if you'd help me do that.
4016194,eng,What else is there to do?
7190445,eng,I assume that you know what this is.
2388071,eng,I never do that.
6665449,eng,Tell me what you plan to do.
5904790,eng,Tom went abroad soon after he graduated from college.
7243796,eng,Sami isn't smart.
6227626,eng,I spent a couple of hours sitting on a bench in the park feeding birds.
4218241,eng,Have you been working there for long?
5851174,eng,How could that possibly help people?
6651999,eng,Tom said that he was at home yesterday.
3909572,eng,Who sent her?
6357440,eng,Tom doesn't know Mary didn't win.
1112890,eng,"I hate to break the news, but I've found someone else."
2952907,eng,I've had a high fever for three days.
278538,eng,My brother has been much too rowdy lately.
45710,eng,The ship disappeared beyond the horizon.
6574112,eng,Is it inclusive or exclusive?
3168061,eng,You always were the smart one.
6509194,eng,Tom and Mary were very candid in their interview.
2957784,eng,Tom put the guitar case down so he could hug Mary.
6425812,eng,Mary told me she'd be back soon.
7537351,eng,I'm beginning to believe that we'll never convince Tom he's wrong.
6002351,eng,This is the happiest I've ever been.
7503223,eng,I know that Tom doesn't know that I shouldn't be doing that.
7537557,eng,I wish that I could forget about that incident.
266218,eng,Will you hand in your essays at the end of the lesson?
6415887,eng,Tell Mary that she needs to apologize to Tom.
7389327,eng,He's upstairs in his bedroom.
2541108,eng,I thought Tom was carrying a gun.
6385924,eng,Sami was the last to leave the store.
1961428,eng,I thought the show was over.
7182306,eng,Tom said that he knew that something was wrong.
2609464,eng,Daddy's working.
5767566,eng,Mary is dating two guys at the same time.
5741158,eng,I'm just happy that I won.
6659158,eng,I'm getting better at playing the guitar.
7544045,eng,Tom held the door open for us.
262348,eng,"He added that I should come to the party, too."
5620544,eng,We haven't been to Boston in a long time.
6570615,eng,Tom put Mary's present in a bag with pictures of cute penguins on it.
6709583,eng,Sami mistreated Layla.
3905076,eng,We shouldn't trust them.
3142883,eng,I have to ask you a few questions.
2761496,eng,We can work outdoors only as long as it's light.
870496,eng,You know how much I appreciate your expertise.
7071536,eng,They had the absolute majority on this one.
6870239,eng,You could have stayed in Boston.
1024690,eng,Tom isn't lonely now.
313668,eng,She is better off than she was when I met her last.
6235730,eng,"You're still a resident of Boston, aren't you?"
6064333,eng,Don't you want to try another one?
50749,eng,"When Sony came back with a 2 billion bid, CBS could not refuse."
6351925,eng,Tom would never forgive you if you ate all the cookies that he baked for Mary.
2254658,eng,Where's our car?
70892,eng,Your skirt is out of fashion.
1961316,eng,I thought I'd answered all your questions.
6248591,eng,Tom said that he was enjoying himself.
6237495,eng,I didn't have enough money to go home by bus.
6302511,eng,"Good, talk to me."
7733183,eng,We're sick of your complaining.
3826633,eng,I didn't show them anything.
1550042,eng,Tom thinks that nothing bad can happen to him.
2956821,eng,Tom had a good reason for being late.
1852268,eng,Stop being so nice.
6823731,eng,Sami is only a short distance away.
4666193,eng,There's a lot to consider.
579656,eng,He'll leave for Tokyo tomorrow.
6650195,eng,Tom said that he didn't think that Mary ought to do that.
3908082,eng,Tell him I'm in a meeting.
7514246,eng,How did Tom know Mary knew how to do that?
28119,eng,I'm thinking of going to Germany to study medicine.
7197243,eng,It isn't very likely to rain tomorrow.
6240951,eng,Tom seems to be aware of what he has to do.
7111886,eng,I thought that you were going to help Tom.
23454,eng,Our country's climate is temperate.
5485585,eng,Everyone wondered who it could be.
6234065,eng,I hope that Tom won't do that until I get there.
3908358,eng,I don't want you to tell him.
6251538,eng,I did that with Tom yesterday.
5851449,eng,We have to do it together.
7541821,eng,Neither Tom nor Mary has a very nice car.
7278211,eng,Sami had to start hiding things from Layla.
526995,eng,This machine impressed everyone.
1549901,eng,"First Asem, then Saule started to cry."
7408456,eng,They washed themselves in the stream.
2833878,eng,I like this song. It has an infectious rhythm and it's good to dance to.
2091163,eng,No one saw Tom take it.
880475,eng,He borrowed two books.
3568455,eng,I have an even better idea.
7150434,eng,Tom wasn't born in Australia.
30181,eng,I have a lot of homework to do.
5006727,eng,We're relatives by marriage.
1245694,eng,My grandmother looks after the children during the daytime.
282469,eng,Uniform number No. 7 is his younger brother.
2361746,eng,I think you've all met.
6246608,eng,Did Tom stay in Boston last summer?
3618966,eng,Tom's technique is impressive.
3994412,eng,God created you.
3442139,eng,Tom doesn't have a landline.
6495598,eng,Tom and Mary haven't said anything they weren't supposed to say.
4577279,eng,"Although I know a lot about Mary, I haven't actually met her."
1092965,eng,Tom seems to be unwilling to change.
61668,eng,It's very hot here.
5736638,eng,"Makes you think, doesn't it?"
6637447,eng,You have better taste than I thought.
3735108,eng,Tom made it clear that he didn't plan to go to Boston.
6449453,eng,Remember all the good times we had?
6401273,eng,Marry me and I'll make you happy.
1148337,eng,Nenwë is a Noldo.
1345929,eng,We have experienced three wars.
6651229,eng,Tom said he wished that Mary wouldn't do that by herself.
6498469,eng,I asked Tom and Mary what they thought was going to happen.
3289180,eng,Lions are animals.
3342785,eng,You'll die out there.
7733131,eng,Mary and Alice are like brothers.
7228721,eng,I don't think Tom will be punished for doing that.
6910165,eng,Tom told you the truth.
3273254,eng,I follow French classes online.
7287074,eng,Sami received six more e-mails from Layla.
3723114,eng,Tom gave Mary an icy glare.
324239,eng,I believe more in diet than in drugs.
1025644,eng,Tom got shampoo in his eyes.
4502055,eng,Cocktails will be at 6:00 and dinner will be served at 6:30.
7143430,eng,I didn't think that Tom was supportive enough.
6350338,eng,I told you Tom could win.
2269030,eng,"Under present circumstances, I don't intend to return to my country."
3287259,eng,Let me get you something for the pain.
28500,eng,Do you know of any inexpensive stores?
1883369,eng,Please take a moment to read our privacy policy.
6494015,eng,Tom and Mary couldn't unlock the door because they had the wrong key.
7442044,eng,They wished that they had more money.
6513321,eng,I'm sure Tom and Mary know what they're doing.
2315336,eng,I don't want to talk about that right now.
7033209,eng,Can you describe your dream girl?
23164,eng,We debated the problem.
5164847,eng,I think Tom is very cool.
6406579,eng,Mary said she wasn't planning to go to Boston next week.
382317,eng,Have you eaten yet?
2376071,eng,I know it's not possible.
7472747,eng,Tom and Mary say that they're fine.
270514,eng,This is the life.
7244066,eng,Sami and Layla don't know each other.
1647756,eng,She doesn't even remember me.
3728796,eng,I don't need a psychologist.
4135183,eng,How long have you been a doctor here?
1327641,eng,I only entrusted the secret to you.
4437677,eng,Mary shouldn't do that.
2307491,eng,I'm going to get on the next bus.
5097710,eng,Context helps to define what is really meant.
7227546,eng,I don't think that a native speaker would ever say it that way.
2047745,eng,Listen carefully and do what I tell you to do.
680400,eng,There is a border between America and Mexico.
455949,eng,I'm drinking water because I'm thirsty.
2031559,eng,I'm not the guy you want making this decision.
1496062,eng,Almost one-third of all office workers wear glasses.
6877307,eng,I think this is really interesting.
5659425,eng,I doubt very seriously that Tom would ever do that.
7174586,eng,I thought that it was Tom's.
2155062,eng,Learn a language for free.
3390615,eng,Your room is ready now.
6423926,eng,Mary said she's willing to do that.
3908575,eng,You can't tell them not to go.
4976900,eng,That's an important distinction to make.
7288787,eng,Sami felt something hit his shoulder.
2548612,eng,Tom dried his eyes.
3903004,eng,I like working with her.
2863164,eng,You gave up.
49266,eng,The song reminds me of my young days.
5936903,eng,Tom is waiting to pick his nephew up.
3128302,eng,He has Alzheimer's.
6520609,eng,You know what Tom and Mary want.
3081535,eng,There weren't many visitors spending their vacations on the island in April.
6271277,eng,Tom is counting his money.
2026388,eng,I just don't want to do that right now.
6151016,eng,He respects his only sibling.
2958310,eng,Tom took a bite of Mary's donut.
3436462,eng,Tom is wearing the hat you gave him.
6521305,eng,When are Tom and Mary arriving?
7494284,eng,Where did he learn how to sing the blues?
4499817,eng,I use Google every day.
6864828,eng,Tom shouldn't lie to Mary.
244136,eng,My wife likes to eat out and so she doesn't have to cook.
5938084,eng,Tom and Mary have three kids.
3989471,eng,Dan didn't even start writing.
7219404,eng,Sami doesn't have sixty bucks.
6357382,eng,Tom seemed flustered.
4533380,eng,Why do people dye their hair?
7681718,eng,Mary and I had a fight.
45041,eng,The town was destroyed during the war.
456707,eng,She has her toes in the water.
2407827,eng,I think I should call my lawyer.
6267225,eng,Why should I speak French?
295646,eng,He is not so tall as you.
7392315,eng,He wished he could dance the tango.
7155564,eng,Tom said he doesn't live in Australia anymore.

2652429,eng,He has a blue bicycle.
6412748,eng,Mary said she thinks she can take care of herself.
2542291,eng,None of the windows were open.
2211548,eng,Think of yourself as the owner of the company mentioned.
5922550,eng,"If I didn't know better, I'd say you were trying to hide something from me."
7137053,eng,"Tom is hiding something, isn't he?"
5940056,eng,Lithium-ion batteries are a class of batteries that uses redox reactions involving lithium.
6663783,eng,I have all day to get that done.
7164138,eng,I like Australia a lot.
2276083,eng,I don't know what's real.
2203322,eng,You're selfish.
6864746,eng,The umbrella that I lent you belongs to Tom.
7503610,eng,I don't think Tom knew for certain that Mary would do that.
6530472,eng,Tom is waiting for a tow truck.
312389,eng,She wore a loose jacket.
6518010,eng,I love the way Tom and Mary do that.
7734614,eng,What kind of movies do you watch most often?
6013548,eng,Will you ever do it again?
6251400,eng,I don't like Tom's girlfriend.
6234471,eng,Tom knew he might be allowed to do that by himself.
7442845,eng,Tom and Mary let me know that they could do that.
1495807,eng,What's your sister's name?
5842341,eng,How long did it take for the ambulance to arrive?
3909185,eng,I'll take him some food.
3637948,eng,I'm dying to have a cup of coffee.
4584247,eng,"To know that we know what we know, and that we do not know what we do not know, that is true knowledge."
5938756,eng,Tom agreed to Mary's plan.
7442863,eng,Tom and Mary let me know they couldn't do that.
6415286,eng,Mary shouldn't have gone to Boston by herself.
5491689,eng,Tom and me talked at length about this subject.
7506186,eng,I know Tom knows that Mary's not supposed to do that.
6350787,eng,Tom believed that he could win.
7474717,eng,They say they want to come with us.
520133,eng,I had already heard that song once.
5938925,eng,I'm working up a sweat.
7408720,eng,They shot themselves last night.
1182888,eng,He is the owner of four very big farms in the interior of Sao Paulo.
6271424,eng,Tom doesn't teach anymore.
3164508,eng,Everybody's got secrets.
6501556,eng,Tom and Mary didn't have to come if they didn't want to.
5850950,eng,I do a lot of swimming.
3439762,eng,Tom took out his knife.
4371160,eng,I've started exercising more intensively for a shorter amount of time.
7179670,eng,Tom said that his parents are divorced.
46158,eng,The colony declared independence.
3541926,eng,And it was only with great difficulty.
6336208,eng,I wonder whether Tom would mind babysitting our kids tomorrow night.
5746945,eng,Do you still drink milk?
5360667,eng,Does she drink milk?
2251184,eng,That's our priority.
7400764,eng,She says she'll never go again.
6499563,eng,Tom and Mary say they hope John knows who has to do that.
3908196,eng,Would you tell him I'm ready?
6267492,eng,Tom asked Mary if she wanted to do that.
44015,eng,There was much argument against the bill.

314420,eng,She took me for Mr Tamori.
267709,eng,May I take a rest for a while?
2548774,eng,I'll just go check.
316040,eng,She burst into view.
7164453,eng,Tom has just gotten back from Australia.
5245749,eng,I had no idea Tom was coming.
7130147,eng,Tom took a deep breath and started to speak.
298520,eng,He was happy being a Jew.
6660471,eng,I seldom need to speak French anymore.
6958566,eng,Is there a reason for your hesitation?
462694,eng,The eagle had to be fed by hand.
2240358,eng,You frightened Tom.
2897658,eng,"Of course, an acrobat must have a perfect sense of balance."
6237383,eng,Tom didn't lose as much weight as he wanted to.
6425129,eng,Mary told me she was from Boston.
6369316,eng,I go to the gym two or three times a week.
772786,eng,I located the town on the map.
6226563,eng,Tom told Mary that he thought John wasn't unconscious.
2544163,eng,I'm investigating a murder.
40189,eng,Can I change the channel?
7111894,eng,I thought that you said you'd rather not do that.
3834207,eng,What's desirable isn't always doable.
1933577,eng,I appreciate your insights.
3825291,eng,It's all you really can do.
6043008,eng,Could Layla have attacked both Sami and Salima?
2713628,eng,Tom climbed the tree.
263690,eng,His account of the accident accords with yours.
2393886,eng,That is the height of foolishness.
2947374,eng,Smart people can pretend to be dumb. The opposite is more difficult.
7294412,eng,Sami knows the area.
7270475,eng,Sami did all of that.
7134661,eng,"Tom is going to save us, isn't he?"
4499170,eng,Everyone saw what happened.
6946919,eng,You look like you've got ants in your pants.
323961,eng,You must not insist on going out alone so late at night.
5757960,eng,I love these guys.
1956033,eng,I only drink water.
3918452,eng,Go and find him.
3733650,eng,I'm feeling a bit stiff.
2033800,eng,I didn't want to make the same mistake twice.
7405359,eng,She says she won't stay.
7182078,eng,Tom said that he thought that the pilot was drunk.
3060774,eng,Telegraph us when you get to Boston.
684679,eng,Nothing beats the pleasure of mutual understanding when using a foreign language.
6348909,eng,I had intended to try doing that.
4495633,eng,No answer is necessary.
4984708,eng,I've been praying for you.
7170362,eng,I knew that Tom very well.
6854282,eng,Tom climbed into the truck and drove off.
250069,eng,"As for me, I have nothing against the plan."
6527311,eng,I promise I won't wake you up when I get home.
6532369,eng,Tom isn't invited.
6256424,eng,We can do that here if you want.
3856928,eng,I enlisted voluntarily.
7476794,eng,They packed their bags.
5289094,eng,My speaking and listening are not as good as my writing.
2957143,eng,Tom is itching to leave.
3121697,eng,Tom looks a bit nervous.
7508895,eng,Everybody here knows Tom speaks very good French.
7514208,eng,I didn't know that Tom was a dairy farmer.
5355039,eng,Again!
252522,eng,I made out a check for $25 and handed it to the salesperson.
329276,eng,Only in novels do you find individuals who live out their whole life with unvarying character.

2588503,eng,The river delta has flooded many times. I don't know why anyone continues to build there.
7378735,eng,Mary says she's never grown corn.
7178346,eng,Tom said that Mary knew that John might not want to do that.
6249316,eng,This is a good time to visit Boston.
267984,eng,The boy knows many magic tricks.
3170637,eng,Tom handed Mary a blue folder.
6513075,eng,Tom and Mary don't think they need to do that.
7512382,eng,I know that Tom is a better swimmer than me.
4012540,eng,It may just be a matter of time.
3903171,eng,I spent a lot of time with them.
7540500,eng,Tom showed his grandfather how to use the ATM.
5441782,eng,Tom did a phenomenal job here.
7734786,eng,"Tom is a third-year student, isn't he?"
1128115,eng,Suspenders make my personality.
5852915,eng,I was unhappy.
6222823,eng,Tom hasn't yet finished doing that.
3226576,eng,Tom didn't realize he was in any danger.
7218377,eng,Tom told me that he thought that Mary was the last one to do that.
6649556,eng,Tom said that he knew that Mary might be permitted to do that by herself.
40794,eng,"Even if it is true, it matters little."
49278,eng,The song was a big hit.
5129546,eng,Christians believe that God is the creator of the world.
7451899,eng,Mary is jealous of Alice.
5386421,eng,Tom was orphaned when he was three.
3023171,eng,"When Tom entered the room, he saw a large banner that said ""Happy Birthday, Tom."""
6528814,eng,I just started working here yesterday.
2255344,eng,You'll be ruined.
7504257,eng,I know that Tom didn't really want to do that by himself.
241578,eng,What if he comes back now?
7189679,eng,Sami was in a rehab place.
241621,eng,A wind from the ocean blows at this time of the year.
7112274,eng,Tom seemed to be dubious.
2688153,eng,I heard him while he was playing the violin.
1566871,eng,Tom wakes from a deep sleep.
7294038,eng,Why exactly do you have to do that?
6246777,eng,Maybe Tom doesn't know what to do.
6429006,eng,Mary has made up her mind.
1939134,eng,I thought you wouldn't mind waiting for me.
57860,eng,This town boasts a large public library.
2995480,eng,Has anyone gone through this stuff yet?
3331482,eng,Tom was bullied when he was a kid.
7503440,eng,I'm pretty sure Tom and Mary have both finished doing that.
7126480,eng,Tom really picked up the slack.
7377040,eng,Mary told me that she needed money.
2862578,eng,We meant it.
2361809,eng,I won't let Tom do that.
6238442,eng,Tom and I are no longer married to each other.
7383795,eng,He's sure that everybody saw him.
4132387,eng,I think Tom did that intentionally.
267967,eng,The boy considered the dolphin his best friend.
279304,eng,The telephone rang repeatedly.
6238611,eng,Did you really not go to Boston last summer?
2639648,eng,Tom waters his lawn at least once a week when there's no rain.
7471776,eng,Tom and Mary still haven't paid their rent.
7736051,eng,You can just reply with a yes or no.
6675836,eng,I suspect that Tom is right.
6096490,eng,Do not drink too much brandy!
1068295,eng,May I ask you a favour?
6422125,eng,Mary will be very sorry she did that.
6510788,eng,Tom and Mary said that they were really nervous.
4012276,eng,This is going to be a great trip.
1454079,eng,To learn a foreign language requires a lot of time.
6900729,eng,Did you get angry too?
5715667,eng,We spent a good evening together yesterday.
1918763,eng,The two spotted ladybird is very rare.
6496742,eng,Tom and Mary wouldn't tell me who gave them those binoculars.
7227694,eng,I don't think that you should tell Tom the truth.
73544,eng,"How old is she? ""She is twelve years old."""
6528030,eng,Tom says he's going to ask Mary for help.
274886,eng,Many a man has lost his life at sea.
5838647,eng,Fadil lied to protect Layla.
2100004,eng,"And if so, what then?"
5668006,eng,We won't die.
3515256,eng,Spring will arrive there soon.
7375364,eng,Mary said that she'll call you later.
3737200,eng,Let me tell you what you need to say.
7270857,eng,Sami knows you are concerned.
3310021,eng,We've brought you a surprise.
6385767,eng,Sami was still at the clinic.
1305716,eng,My favorite pianist is Frederic Chopin.
6123089,eng,Tom took his car to the mechanic's to get it fixed.
4976725,eng,This annoying bug has finally been fixed.
318389,eng,The disease sheared him of his physical strength.
1841423,eng,He is a yogi.
4403316,eng,Tom is a Turk.
296733,eng,He ended up in jail.
6770185,eng,Tom's rowboat capsized.
7186102,eng,Tom is going to be very sorry that he didn't do that.
6251960,eng,Tom graduated from college last year.
3549974,eng,I cry every time I see this film.
3204844,eng,I'll tell Tom to call you as soon as he gets in.
781039,eng,That's not a bear anymore. That's bear goo.
4463690,eng,Is there something in the refrigerator that we can drink?
256856,eng,Must I hurry?
6393228,eng,Children often use construction paper to make crafts.
6262411,eng,Tom didn't know whether Mary was tired or not.
1028924,eng,Tom forgave Mary for losing all his money.
6866149,eng,I thought you liked pancakes.
6411783,eng,I think you should tell Mary why you don't like her.
7374319,eng,"Mary is very claustrophobic, isn't she?"
2719858,eng,She chops wood every day.
6242064,eng,Tom will come if he's free this afternoon.
6647175,eng,Tom told Mary I was motivated to do that.
5726073,eng,We've become a nation of beggars.
292503,eng,He elbowed me in the ribs.
1963572,eng,"If it doesn't sound English, it's not English."
5746740,eng,Tom looked me in the eye.
3430198,eng,I wouldn't take a glass of water in the desert from you.
4496312,eng,Do they really care?
682403,eng,The children work well together.
6038334,eng,Tom didn't want to tell anybody anything.
55798,eng,What an old book this is!
7406217,eng,They pretended that they were doctors.
6661796,eng,I don't expect to get there on time.
6657024,eng,I'm going to buy that for Tom.
257354,eng,I like to go to the park and watch the children in the playground enjoying themselves.
391684,eng,"If f is not an epimorphism, then it factors through g."
2329631,eng,I got stabbed two years ago.
5936535,eng,Tom says he hasn't seen Mary for three months.
5730888,eng,I ventured off the beaten path.
7237720,eng,Sami took a shit in that toilet stall.
37413,eng,It was the window that Tom broke yesterday.
7511916,eng,I didn't know that I should do that with Tom.
285999,eng,His dog is his good companion.
6512870,eng,Tom and Mary said that they wanted to do that.
5633160,eng,I love helping people.
6139888,eng,Tom advised Mary not to stay out late at night.
326306,eng,The Federal Reserve cut its benchmark discount rate to an 18-year low.
5098608,eng,They had to elope somehow.
3737918,eng,Haven't we been here before?
7114159,eng,Why can't Tom hug Mary?
6708229,eng,I had to stay home all day yesterday to take care of my mother.
7516700,eng,I know Tom is a bit younger than Mary.
2043941,eng,"We don't see this eye to eye, but it's not me who is wrong."
3271218,eng,I had a few things to correct.
7205098,eng,Sami treated Layla like a slave.
6528742,eng,Tom doesn't need to know who did that.
6410973,eng,Mary said she was the only one who needed to do that.
7474173,eng,"They put you up to this, didn't they?"
2859097,eng,He told Mary.
7538201,eng,I'm dirty.
5840442,eng,I always encouraged Tom.
1609271,eng,We played and laughed.
6245740,eng,"You don't need to do that now, do you?"
245144,eng,Shall I go for a walk?
6269280,eng,Tom thought that John was Mary's son.
715644,eng,Someone who is misanthropic dislikes people and avoids social situations.
6695978,eng,Mary was wearing short shorts.
2245409,eng,Drink this juice.
1040679,eng,Tom blamed himself for Mary's death.
6067406,eng,Layla and Sami met at a shopping mall.
7408700,eng,They need to get over themselves.
1886856,eng,May I think about it?
5792483,eng,I figured Tom would mess up again.
1839539,eng,I'm pretty sure it's after 2:30.
5659267,eng,Tom is going to go swimming this afternoon.
2646385,eng,Tom isn't a communist.
5746179,eng,That was a good meeting.
3765188,eng,"What am I supposed to do? ""I don't know. Do something."""
2276418,eng,You seem to hate women.
3819811,eng,Thanks for showing me how to do this.
2388098,eng,I never forgot that.
2293277,eng,I assumed Tom was still at home.
3093641,eng,You should come with me to Tom's house.
6972025,eng,Tom creates music playlists for retail shops.
3087597,eng,Tom was embarrassed when told he had made a drunken pass at Mary's mother at the party.
5735694,eng,Tom immediately sensed danger.
2865114,eng,Mary loves sunsets.
7473673,eng,They aren't going to sell their houses.
6425094,eng,Mary told us she'd do that again.
3348082,eng,You left me no choice.
6521707,eng,Why are Tom and Mary sneezing?
4111380,eng,"Let me take a break, please."
3232391,eng,He came while I was still asleep.
300091,eng,He was patient.
7434318,eng,"Perspecticide is often part of a strategy of coercive control that may include manipulation, stalking, and physical abuse. Abusers make their partners narrow their worlds."
4358928,eng,I'll give you what for.
320819,eng,My mother is busy in the kitchen.
280948,eng,I'd like you to get two adjacent rooms.
3249400,eng,I'm teaching them to swim.
3402533,eng,Tom has taught French for thirty years.
60935,eng,It must have been difficult for her to knit this sweater.
2111809,eng,I apologized.
3726503,eng,We'll solve it together.
5753479,eng,Tom doesn't answer me.
2270189,eng,Where's the exit?
18138,eng,"By chance, I met her in the street."
2573349,eng,I have nothing to add.
6654517,eng,Tom said he didn't think that Mary knew how to do that.
3409064,eng,Tom hastily packed his suitcase.
6482876,eng,"God makes people who are beautiful, have a great voice and a very good memory. God also makes people who have only one of these qualities, but God also makes people who have none of these three qualities, one of whom I am."
2406219,eng,I say it's worth the risk.
3185364,eng,Tom couldn't stay silent any longer.
6222956,eng,What do you usually eat for supper?
7509565,eng,I didn't know that I shouldn't do that with Tom.
3260192,eng,I went to the university only to see my former French teacher again.
276119,eng,Someone set fire to the house.
1218675,eng,"A sumo wrestler thinks nothing of consuming 20,000 calories a day."
2824821,eng,At Tatoeba you teach in the most efficient way possible — through examples.
7113537,eng,I'd like scrambled eggs.
5546009,eng,We have to make sure we do that.
6870587,eng,None of this would have happened if we'd been more careful.
6922424,eng,I didn't know that I didn't have enough money to buy what I needed.
5726002,eng,I'm not worried about comparisons.
3903888,eng,You'd better go with us.
7512790,eng,Tom was the only one who was drinking beer.
478484,eng,Tell me what you need and I'll tell you how to get along without it.
5851612,eng,Are you going to break up with Tom?
2647105,eng,Put it in the drawer.
7189251,eng,You should assume anything you do online is public.
35462,eng,Place the ladder against the wall.
5953703,eng,"Sorry, dude, but you don't stand a chance. She's way out of your league."
7398632,eng,She said that she was interested.
3085374,eng,Do you have an empty room in this hotel?
6268738,eng,Tom told me he spoke French.
4494801,eng,We were lucky again.
3991252,eng,Dan forgot to wear gloves.
2582014,eng,I had just put it before you ask me to.
7232057,eng,I don't think that I'll stay until the end of the concert.
7190479,eng,Sami stayed faithful to Layla.
7175818,eng,Tom thinks that Mary will be finished doing that by 2:30.
5853151,eng,I wanted more.
7733906,eng,Is Tom feeling better?
6351130,eng,Tom seemed to like doing that.
6265644,eng,Where were you last spring?
6050386,eng,This sink is made of stainless steel.
6111774,eng,Layla's best chance of being seen is to find high ground.
3733027,eng,I'm not sure Tom's going to be willing to talk to me.
6266320,eng,Tom said that Mary wasn't having any fun.
1229115,eng,Music has no age.
7111383,eng,I don't think that Tom knows if Mary is happy or not.
20490,eng,"Thanks to the opportunity, we were able to avoid substantial effort."
6957602,eng,"There you have it all in a nutshell, Watson, and if you can give me any light I shall be infinitely obliged to you."
1148322,eng,You see me.
40457,eng,"Somebody, open this door, please."
1686418,eng,I cannot meet him out. It's raining.
2543873,eng,You're always welcome here.
327326,eng,It's just throwing money away to have a yacht you rarely use.
6513789,eng,I'm sure Tom and Mary weren't surprised.
6504799,eng,Tom and Mary visit me every time they come to Boston.
1138329,eng,Everybody knows you're more intelligent than she is.
266121,eng,It is a toss-up whether to drink sake or whiskey; too much of either results equally in drunken revelry.
2658204,eng,I am grateful for people who help me understand.
6815353,eng,Do you live by yourself?
1006279,eng,The syntax of Python scripts is very simple.
28240,eng,The committee adjourned to another hall.
2361483,eng,I don't think Tom is innocent.
5744426,eng,They were expecting more.
1985575,eng,Get out of bed.
6657735,eng,We're going to eventually find out the truth.
49081,eng,The company is on the verge of bankruptcy.
3017291,eng,I got caught in a traffic jam on the expressway.
5360735,eng,She has no deep convictions.
3797008,eng,I went to school.
6237070,eng,I think Tom is waiting for you on the porch.
486963,eng,He promised to be here at 6.
680751,eng,They talked during the movie.
6341689,eng,I don't think Tom knows what time it is.
5023017,eng,The bun was half eaten.
2537104,eng,Tom didn't have much time to clean the room before Mary arrived.
3449262,eng,Tom is rich enough to buy just about anything he wants.
300226,eng,"Having failed several times, he succeeded at last."
6664945,eng,Tom asked if there was anything he could do to help.
3927472,eng,Linda is my new British friend.
6652529,eng,Tom said he thought that Mary was likely to cry.
6772332,eng,Tom kissed Mary. He kissed Alice as well.
5922032,eng,I'm learning Welsh.
7117199,eng,Tom works hard at his job.
6376072,eng,"Sami, such a beautiful name."
6264232,eng,Tom's technique is pretty good.
3259006,eng,We saw the sea reflected in the mirror of the restaurant.
2548456,eng,You need some help.
6226867,eng,Everybody except Tom knew that he didn't have to stay in Boston.
293388,eng,He lives in a poor district of London.
1331451,eng,This girl is much stronger than him.
2897158,eng,"How is the research going? ""Reasonably well."""
6731864,eng,You will learn a lot here.
7265457,eng,Sami was a very tough guy.
7400381,eng,He can have whatever he wants.
7286634,eng,Sami started telling Layla everything.
5953384,eng,"Take a left, and it's the first building on your right."
291301,eng,He was stumped by the problem.
890324,eng,"It's the first sunny day in a long time, so the clothes should dry in no time."
7172280,eng,I thought that you'd like to know who's coming over for dinner.
7228255,eng,I don't think that we'll need to stay here much longer.
284236,eng,It makes no difference to me whether he likes baseball or football.
268431,eng,The crew had to abandon the sinking ship.
6118631,eng,It was difficult for Tom to do that.
2064697,eng,Don't I owe you something?
6261682,eng,Your advice has been helpful.
2163119,eng,Airplanes land at airports.
578533,eng,"If you're serious about solving the problem, then you cannot pose it as a Catch-22."
6226813,eng,About how many hours does it take to get from here to Boston?
3316950,eng,I will always have a certain fondness for this sitcom because my grandmother and I used to watch it together.
6108877,eng,You're wearing my sunglasses.
3009143,eng,Why doesn't he have anything to say?
2951124,eng,We often skip school.
7505230,eng,I know Tom is afraid that the police might arrest Mary.
826610,eng,Did you know that this is a sentence?
6416954,eng,Mary said she wanted to go home early today.
2545577,eng,I want to get a real job.
243131,eng,I want to read as many English books as possible this year.
2628669,eng,Please wait ten minutes.
5466728,eng,Tom is in for a shock.
2330074,eng,I guess my luck just ran out.
27521,eng,How in the world did you do such a thing?
7399635,eng,He says he can't speak French.
2542362,eng,I'm sorry I couldn't help you.
3831097,eng,Tom and Mary are on their way here now.
2944457,eng,"Hey, didn't you wear that shirt yesterday?"
1093445,eng,Tom is proud of his son.
7116999,eng,I can't seem to keep out of trouble.
3022629,eng,Do you think Mary wears smart clothes?
6416476,eng,"Mary doesn't still need to do that, does she?"
1071892,eng,I have congee every morning.
3229416,eng,I'm a long way from home.
5643850,eng,I feel like I'm ready for that.
2643932,eng,Tom never shows up on time.
812519,eng,I won't let you down.
6069594,eng,Layla was taken against her will.
7160973,eng,Sami and Layla got along pretty well.
4500041,eng,I already saw this.
42612,eng,You should leave it for tomorrow.
7375415,eng,Mary said that she was asked to help.
3330055,eng,I was happy to see Tom.
5454804,eng,I hope you're doing what I told you to do.
7226904,eng,I don't think that Tom is sure that's what Mary has to do.
5936445,eng,Tom lost his life in a mountain climbing accident.
3148375,eng,"If I hadn't come to Boston, this never would've happened."
7472788,eng,Tom and Mary aren't what they seem.
261489,eng,I've climbed Mt. Fuji.
6104346,eng,Science doesn't know everything.
5809792,eng,Can we rent one of these boats?
6411091,eng,Mary knows you didn't eat the cake she baked for you.
3917491,eng,I'm looking for them now.
5744738,eng,Nobody gets used to that.
7117922,eng,Tom will likely be available.
6345679,eng,I didn't think that Tom would win.
6504960,eng,I know that Tom and Mary are reluctant to do that.
1331584,eng,These two concepts are intimately related.
7141444,eng,Sami became a monster.
289953,eng,He is talking of going to Spain this winter.
5916941,eng,Tom never seems to get upset.
2394403,eng,Be mindful of your actions when in a relationship.What may seem playful to you could really be harmful to your partner.
6085150,eng,"I think something's wrong with my eyes, because I can't take them off you."
6500562,eng,Tom and Mary wouldn't tell me why they wouldn't do that.
269498,eng,The woodland was parceled into farms.
6665869,eng,I got stung by a jellyfish.
6116186,eng,He's my leader.
6351345,eng,I wasn't sure you'd like that.
838664,eng,Do you have a rewards card?
4494134,eng,Corruption is still common.
17679,eng,Not only you but also he is ignorant of the truth.
6234679,eng,I don't think I'll be able to do that by myself.
4401032,eng,Is it hazardous?
1430133,eng,My parents gave me a house when we got married.
6416332,eng,Mary never told anyone where she hid the key.
6660313,eng,You'd better be careful what you say around Tom.
2137224,eng,I think she's innocent.
26651,eng,To tell a lie is wrong.
240879,eng,Antibodies give a new lease of life.
2240659,eng,We're really good.
6013318,eng,I just stole something from Tom.
3071806,eng,Do you know their address?
6435831,eng,Tom won't get away with it this time.
3222929,eng,Let's sit tight.
1686642,eng,I cannot peg up my clothes. It's too windy.
246723,eng,I hoped that I would marry while my mother was still alive.
4463797,eng,"Tom shaved his beard off after becoming a fan of stoats, since stoats, the paragon of beauty, don't grow beards."
6225911,eng,"I couldn't do that last year, but I can now."
3583315,eng,I thought college would be a more interesting place.
6509258,eng,Are Tom and Mary still living on Park Street?
6898242,eng,"You aren't still afraid, are you?"
2891469,eng,Is this going to work?
5134249,eng,We'll sneak into bed now.
3737461,eng,Tom made it clear that he didn't intend to help Mary.
2615578,eng,The men's room is on the second floor.
1234067,eng,"He always looks like he's half-asleep, but once he gets into an argument, he really goes to town."
6123720,eng,I don't know if Tom can do that or not.
2990006,eng,Can you play well?
240171,eng,Shadow him.
2408626,eng,I think you need help.
6593143,eng,Sami had room to hit Farid with a baseball bat.
4655135,eng,The viand prepared by Nanay is delicious.
7505398,eng,"You know that Tom is not likely to do that, don't you?"
6491397,eng,I wonder whether Tom and Mary want to buy a car.
6522447,eng,Why are Tom and Mary afraid?
434192,eng,Almost everyone arrived on time.
3920656,eng,I have a theory about her.
327568,eng,This wasn't here this morning ... looks like somebody's been fly tipping.
7386211,eng,He stomped his foot angrily.
7235746,eng,I don't think that anyone really knows the real me.
6232092,eng,Can you buy that for Tom?
7453162,eng,We must try again.
585727,eng,"Sleeping in a dumpster, huh? Al-Sayib asked. ""That must have been a smelly experience."""
3821740,eng,What's our other option?
285701,eng,His house is across the street.
2113218,eng,I've been waiting for you.
20730,eng,Improving corporate performances are behind the stock market recovery.
3429727,eng,"If you have been listening, thanks for paying attention."
3079480,eng,We've found an eyewitness that says you shot Tom.
6932197,eng,"This is not the highway, this is just an access road."
5613118,eng,I've already been swimming once today.
2650249,eng,How could I have been so stupid?
6687032,eng,"Don't think in your native tongue, said the monolingual Tom."
291142,eng,He was agitated by the news.
3722645,eng,Tom was the manager before me.
6266155,eng,Tom wasn't able to convince Mary do that.
58847,eng,This dictionary is superior to that one.
6522763,eng,Tom and Mary did what they could.
6689556,eng,There is a crate under the table.
2016592,eng,Do you want to let me talk or not?
7438948,eng,They said that they isn't going ashore.
5820567,eng,I think my engine is broken.
5144121,eng,Tom was buried in this city.
65983,eng,"Whenever I call, he is out."
6502707,eng,Tom and Mary said John wanted them to do that for them.
5069703,eng,It's just not good enough.
60079,eng,Do you want any of these flowers?
6499952,eng,Tom and Mary might've left their umbrellas in John's car.
6733402,eng,Tom is richer than he seems.
416236,eng,"In 2009, Korea suffered the dishonor of having the highest suicide rate amongst OECD countries."
5972330,eng,"Time lost is time when we have not lived a full human life, time unenriched by experience, creative endeavor, enjoyment, and suffering. Time lost is time not filled, time left empty."
5424710,eng,It was still warm.
733816,eng,The pier took a real beating from the hurricane.
6259557,eng,Tom told Mary that he thought John had been late.
2254051,eng,I'm sure I can get away with it.
5734671,eng,This rule should be followed.
1555012,eng,I chewed the gum.
1655645,eng,"One way or round trip? ""One way, please."""
16988,eng,If only I had taken your advice.
1972624,eng,Feel this.
1018426,eng,He's a historian.
273657,eng,Not all good men will prosper.
2891127,eng,Do you think Tom is dangerous?
6685945,eng,Thomas has a picture of his family on his desk.
2609977,eng,"Even after delivery, you can't drink alcohol when you are breastfeeding."
3044386,eng,Tom's mouth was taped shut with duct tape.
303199,eng,He ascribes his poverty to bad luck.
7289123,eng,Sami is at school.
5827722,eng,"As much as she hated Gilbert, however, did she love Diana, with all the love of her passionate little heart, equally intense in its likes and dislikes."
6429723,eng,Does Mary like her job?
1681968,eng,I cannot calculate this. I am not an engineer.
2715870,eng,"He used to go to school by bicycle, but now he goes by bus."
6496562,eng,Tom and Mary don't know how much time they'll have to do that.
2917700,eng,> means greater than.
7043624,eng,Rivers like the Rhine and the Elbe have soaked up so much heat that fish are beginning to suffocate.
7387289,eng,He couldn't control his temper.
7364376,eng,You seem to have made quite an impression upon him.
7132040,eng,Do you like being with me?
2218422,eng,You're the biggest.
2249998,eng,Speed isn't everything.
5608157,eng,"You haven't yet done what you were supposed to do, have you?"
7439061,eng,They said they haven't studied French.
7271444,eng,Sami talked to his mom after school.
5473718,eng,Tom doesn't have to work on Sundays.
6921755,eng,We saw the two teachers.
1894605,eng,It's a shame Tom couldn't make it to your party.
1005356,eng,"The hand has five fingers: the thumb, the index finger, the middle finger, the ring finger, and the pinky."
2245670,eng,I demand satisfaction.
6502359,eng,Tom and Mary said they'll be the first ones to do that.
304959,eng,I've been expecting good news from them.
4917644,eng,"Fuck, what kind of asshole calls people in the middle of the night?"
5683100,eng,Tom cries easily.
1931871,eng,Does your father know?
6357675,eng,Tom and Mary often eat together.
728009,eng,People eagerly sought a more modernised style of dress and transformed the old qipao to suit their tastes.
1165944,eng,We must give in in some extent if we want to get to an agreement.
62393,eng,This is why she is still angry with me.
29562,eng,Lucy made her parents happy.
6666862,eng,I didn't think Tom would be so skeptical.
6869763,eng,"I could have gone to the seaside, but I went to the mountains instead."
262598,eng,Our train was delayed on account of the heavy snow.
5817833,eng,He does think he's too good for us.
44272,eng,The doctors were wrong to condemn the couple.
37525,eng,Which airport do I leave from?
3912935,eng,I knew someone like him once.
255354,eng,I mistook a notebook for a textbook.
46724,eng,The class meets once a week.
7386179,eng,He spilled soup on his shirt.
6414744,eng,Mary said I could wait here until she got back.
6927915,eng,How often did you do that when you were a teenager?
6419267,eng,Mary said she was glad that she did that.
5756649,eng,Details are sketchy.
1095970,eng,Tom and Mary have a lot in common.
2932103,eng,Maybe it was just a coincidence.
3405179,eng,It might be fun to try.
5937445,eng,Tom was a kid when that happened.
6428176,eng,Mary painted her room white.
2792554,eng,That is the most beautiful thing of all.
264601,eng,Don't use any words whose meanings you don't know well.
7403441,eng,She thinks she's infallible.
2540316,eng,You would look good in that dress.
2271911,eng,I don't remember Tom.
3731903,eng,Are you a seismologist?
5087334,eng,I come from Italy and I speak Italian.
239608,eng,The plan was rejected as being impractical.
6236663,eng,Am I the only one who doesn't want to do that?
1834162,eng,How did Tom manage to lose so much weight so quickly?
6587145,eng,Sami is not allowed to go to East Jerusalem.
7442016,eng,They won't let anyone into their houses.
6143139,eng,You can use a keyword to help you remember complicated topics.
6874327,eng,You can't keep me from doing that.
325406,eng,"Frankly speaking, your way of thinking is out of date."
2789169,eng,I'm so sorry for what's happened but don't worry. It won't happen again.
3181581,eng,We're waiting to talk to Tom.
2674962,eng,There were indeed seven of us.
24106,eng,All the furniture was covered with dust.
7379399,eng,Mary stayed in her room all day.
7391103,eng,He started taking off his shoes.
2475571,eng,You don't even know who your father is.
3313938,eng,Tom is really busy most of the time.
5155364,eng,I'll stay in Berlin for ten days.
3906845,eng,I just wanted to speak to them.
2662904,eng,Does anyone else have a problem with that?
6408407,eng,Mary said she thought she knew what had caused the accident.
2538064,eng,Tom asked if there was anything he could do.
7147692,eng,Sami hid the camera.
7508741,eng,I knew that Tom wasn't the only one who did that.
6296961,eng,"What star is closest to the Earth? ""Isn't it Alpha Centauri?"" ""No! It's the sun!"""
7474913,eng,They did the only thing they could.
6661088,eng,I had a dream that I won the lottery.
4742659,eng,The handwritten text is illegible.
2240703,eng,We're up early.
4986319,eng,I don't like to be judged.
1011281,eng,You look good.
298371,eng,He apologized to them for taking up their time.
59131,eng,This work is enough to break my back.
2941342,eng,They won't find it.
1920804,eng,It was not an accident.
252558,eng,I plan to stay here for three days.
7329385,eng,Sami made me so mad.
2545838,eng,They'll know what to do.
2879569,eng,How would you know about that?
5733579,eng,I like to eat yellow rice with cucumber pickles.
6511011,eng,I didn't realize Tom and Mary were so rich.
7110427,eng,Tom looked into the rearview mirror.
2207210,eng,She doesn't want to go to church.
5936404,eng,You're not very likely to succeed this time either.
2271352,eng,Don't thank me now.
4351103,eng,The notebooks should be put in a drawer.
7172527,eng,I thought that Tom had agreed to do that.
4692952,eng,The loss of their mother affected them greatly.
5726335,eng,I've always been generous to you.
1647596,eng,The Ministry of Education increased the proportion of indigenous language usage in the schools.
306412,eng,They made their way through the crowd.
5236065,eng,Only some questions have answers.
255200,eng,I sometimes lie on the grass.
7513812,eng,I know that Tom might not want to do that.
6899099,eng,Were you forced to be do that?
302412,eng,"He is short, but he is strong."
6588383,eng,I need a bag to throw up in.
2545162,eng,Tom offered Mary a donut.
7180000,eng,Tom said that he's glad that you were able to do that when you were in Boston.
3395429,eng,Can you believe it? We're in China!
3953253,eng,Tom asked his family to never buy him a skydiving voucher for any of his birthdays.
3168295,eng,All I need is one.
3229916,eng,Tom has a new car.
2315247,eng,I don't ever remember meeting Tom.
7391194,eng,She stuck out her tongue.
3831712,eng,Tom doesn't like to wait.
400610,eng,She gave an oral report to her boss.
6501507,eng,I don't think Tom and Mary know whether it's true or not.
2512282,eng,She has otherwordly powers!
1728107,eng,Have you ever watered your backyard?
3096240,eng,Have you seen the man in this picture?
3184587,eng,He is the best drummer.
4015626,eng,I wish I'd never told Tom about what happened.
5858486,eng,Tom was just being silly.
5909722,eng,Tom wrote to Mary to tell her that he loved her.
1256884,eng,I'm immune to disease.
3723766,eng,Tom's left eye started twitching.
24246,eng,We had a lot of furniture.
3765184,eng,There's something wrong with her.
7381520,eng,Mary stopped in her tracks.
5820628,eng,I can't sleep tonight.
5152658,eng,Tom doesn't believe it.
7374227,eng,Mary's parents told her that they thought that she was too young to get married.
69340,eng,Do you know them?
6406499,eng,Mary said she didn't plan on going with us.
6513556,eng,Tom and Mary think they're going to die soon.
1893936,eng,We almost didn't make it to the church on time.
2535381,eng,Oftentimes code will start to smell.
5937064,eng,Tom is a wealthy Boston businessman.
6899299,eng,"Tom is independent, isn't he?"
6243056,eng,I think Tom is considering doing that.
3428355,eng,Tom lied about why he was fired.
5322179,eng,Is that a scientific fact?
433422,eng,"A little louder, please."
6839781,eng,It's not a smoking device.
7231262,eng,I don't think that Tom knows how to dance.
238366,eng,The police are responsible for the maintenance of law and order.
4471299,eng,Tom clapped his hands together.
7361284,eng,I like crispies.
940857,eng,When will I get to Tokyo?
6419720,eng,I hope Mary likes the gift we bought her.
5152700,eng,"No, not me, you!"
6656390,eng,Tom and I are the only ones who aren't able to do that.
2718558,eng,We probably should've talked about this before now.
2642810,eng,Why isn't Tom saying anything?
5098027,eng,I am a busy person.
5938665,eng,I've never been on a ship.
238318,eng,The police compared the fingerprints on the gun with those on the door.
5981529,eng,What is polite in one culture may not be polite in another.
4811436,eng,Tom grew up near Boston.
6268946,eng,Let's visit Boston first.
7158826,eng,Tom lived in Australia until he was thirty.
6064968,eng,Is there anything you have to do today?
5745372,eng,Tom is a man of integrity.
5351367,eng,Why do I have to do this? What's the point?
5938368,eng,I unplugged the lamp.
5575349,eng,How likely is it that two people have the same birthday?
398740,eng,Spiders like to build spiderwebs.
7177349,eng,Tom said that Mary was willing to buy that for you.
2956808,eng,Tom grabbed his rifle and pointed it at Mary.
1816774,eng,Do you still love me?
1887076,eng,I almost forgot to pay my bills last month.
256621,eng,I am aching to go abroad.
7521015,eng,I met somebody who knows we.
1098086,eng,A human being wrote the story.
7475327,eng,They say they can't speak French.
7504591,eng,I wonder if Tom knows Mary needs to do that before noon.
2738944,eng,"This is the house of touch-me Roque. There's always fuss and fights—if it's not the kids quarrelling, it's the parents. There is never a moment of silence here."
6667140,eng,I almost choked.
3728888,eng,I didn't really think it out.
2092615,eng,Is there anyone else around?
6267197,eng,Tom actually tried to do that.
5813822,eng,I hear that Tom is planning to retire in October.
6239540,eng,I didn't want to stay in Boston any longer.
3446998,eng,Tom was in the center of the room.
5848290,eng,Tom won't sing unless you ask him to.
4248123,eng,I shortened my speeches.
6062358,eng,Are you prepared for an emergency?
46678,eng,The accident happened two years ago.
6505572,eng,Tom and Mary don't have any confidence in themselves.
7211549,eng,Tom told me that he thought that Mary would be grumpy.
6699249,eng,That unstoppable feeling you have for her is definitely love.
6235961,eng,"Unfortunately, I was stupid enough to do that."
1740156,eng,I mop my house almost every day.
3448765,eng,I didn't know you didn't know how to swim.
6661220,eng,Tom isn't as strong as I am.
6418315,eng,Mary tried to tell Tom that she liked him.
4361619,eng,It's very hard to see yourself as others see you.
6223970,eng,Tom isn't strong enough yet to do that.
2658365,eng,Look! There's a cockroach besides the fridge! Do something quick!
3919864,eng,I asked them to join us.
2723884,eng,Do you like the colors?
2237694,eng,Tom seems distraught.
3142921,eng,Do you have any other questions you'd like to ask?
5832551,eng,Come to my office. We'll talk about that.
7472409,eng,Tom and Mary certainly enjoy their wine.
297993,eng,He squashed my hat flat.
1096328,eng,We should let sleeping dogs lie.
7393496,eng,He hasn't yet bought what he needs.
706938,eng,Aren't you excited that Anki is almost ready to update to a stable version 1.2?
7243894,eng,Sami saw Layla's apartment.
4409880,eng,She has husband and two daughters.
290103,eng,He often takes advantage of her ignorance.
7314741,eng,"He is a man, she is a woman."
7476637,eng,They greeted their guests.
6493543,eng,Tom and Mary said that they've been wanting to do that for a long time.
7172933,eng,I thought that Tom was scared.
2538985,eng,I wasn't sure I could trust you before.
6898464,eng,"You're pleased, aren't you?"
5966528,eng,It's a complicated language.
34326,eng,The proof of the pudding is in the eating.
5728972,eng,That problem still exists today.
6741966,eng,Tom needed to be told not to do that by himself.
2028596,eng,Do you really think I want to do what I do?
6576820,eng,I was saved.
7697763,eng,It's snowed a lot.
462590,eng,The book costs fifteen dollars.
7549271,eng,Tom has an orange tree in his backyard.
3312059,eng,We'll be leaving shortly.
2406945,eng,I sure wish I could speak French as well as Tom does.
6919721,eng,But Love wanted to make a match of his own devising.
7516340,eng,Tom didn't realize I ought to do that.
6790022,eng,Tom tried to escape from the police.
3729221,eng,I guess I didn't want to disappoint you.
7516466,eng,I know that you aren't yourself today.
6831310,eng,I'll take you there someday.
2546896,eng,We're checking it now.
462554,eng,The admission costs six euros but on Sundays it's free.
462970,eng,The toy store is closed.
6208277,eng,Forget everything I told you!
6941711,eng,I was struck by lightning while golfing.
6432978,eng,Tom didn't want to be in the same room as Mary.
7504603,eng,I think that you shouldn't have done that by yourselves.
1953136,eng,I can't help laughing at that.
5823321,eng,What are you waiting for? Let's go.
6765283,eng,Tom is a theoretical physicist.
282961,eng,He never visits us without bringing some presents for my children.
7347671,eng,Can you point me in the direction of the central station?
3913633,eng,I shouldn't have let you go.
5911465,eng,You're doing that the wrong way.
6271687,eng,Tom knows why Mary studied French.
7316237,eng,Teach your son maths.
3152024,eng,Many houses were damaged beyond repair in the flood.
7214943,eng,Sami gave Layla a toolbox containing everything she needed to fix her car.
281481,eng,How do you like Japan?
1167090,eng,"Until the morning, the camp of the enemy army was surrounded."
3618652,eng,I've never seen these people before in my life.
1202194,eng,Tom doesn't like songs with crude lyrics.
6406915,eng,Mary told me that she thought Tom would be quicker at doing that than John.
2957891,eng,Tom realized something was wrong.
6805869,eng,I don't think it's safe to go out in this kind of weather.
7131945,eng,Do you remember what happened to Tom?
2541828,eng,I'm not surprised to hear that.
6345264,eng,Tom said he didn't have to work today.
3872643,eng,This is a heavy-duty machine.
6652633,eng,Tom said he thought that Mary might need to do that.
6120448,eng,Who told Tom to ask Mary to help John do that?
3113755,eng,I've done some stupid things.
6438825,eng,Tom said that Mary was wrong.
5824734,eng,"He had looked at twenty very much as he looked at sixty, lacking a little of the grayness."
6575440,eng,Its bark is worse than its bite.
2732396,eng,"You caught the ball, didn't you?"
3738170,eng,How did you know I wanted to speak to Tom?
5748280,eng,Life in jail is tough.
255433,eng,I booked through to Paris.
1435670,eng,Bring your student ID.
6236779,eng,"You know that Tom didn't do that, don't you?"
7174768,eng,Tom thought he was going to be busy.
3727024,eng,All we can do now is go on with our lives.
6531552,eng,Tom wanted to make a deal.
7473459,eng,They showed their IDs to the bartender.
6519642,eng,I think Tom and Mary are prepared.
29986,eng,Do you have this symptom often?
248111,eng,I'm afraid we'll lose the game.
2646089,eng,Dinner is on the table.
3199760,eng,Tom thinks Mary knows where John is.
3429876,eng,"If you wish to be treated like an educated person, you have to become an educated person."
2577669,eng,A teacher must not laugh at a pupil who made a mistake.
7292489,eng,The accountant cooked the books.
6089689,eng,One step forward is a step forward for civilization.
5736725,eng,It becomes a vicious circle.
5937348,eng,I'm very interested in folk music.
4833159,eng,Why do you always contradict me?
7129914,eng,Tom didn't seem to be as headstrong as Mary seemed to be.
2647768,eng,Why do you do that?
280521,eng,I especially want to thank our record-breaking sales team.
3147906,eng,Tom leaned over to look at the price tag.
4016817,eng,It's really none of your business.
6713301,eng,Were you able to swim when you were thirteen years old?
2272853,eng,Tom is a professional.
4949956,eng,I've heard this joke before.
6676249,eng,I suspect that Tom will eventually want to do that.
7545191,eng,We really shouldn't have done that.
3728457,eng,I don't want you even thinking about it.
6513479,eng,What kind of songs do Tom and Mary sing?
6222401,eng,You're three years older than I am.
3426244,eng,Tom neglected his duties.
6265297,eng,Tom wondered why Mary was studying French.
6437437,eng,Tom has been acting suspiciously.
7325598,eng,Sami didn't understand what Layla actually meant.
6221870,eng,Tom might not even make the team.
1828595,eng,She knows who he is.
3733428,eng,I don't need your assistance anymore.
6963088,eng,This is the only picture I have of Tom.
6711203,eng,Sami was in a relationship with someone.
5858118,eng,I was the winner.
285610,eng,Your speech was splendid.
7396879,eng,He told everybody he was sleepy.
7150117,eng,Tom wished he were back in Australia.
6496055,eng,"Tom and Mary didn't want to do that, but they said they had to."
6577690,eng,Sami came out of the shadows and shared his story.
1092624,eng,Tom tried to prevent Mary from joining the army.
6067416,eng,Layla went to the mall.
7398460,eng,He says he'll agree to do that.
3076557,eng,Tom and Maria dressed up as the Evil Wolf and the Little Red Riding Hood for Rosenmontag.
6091202,eng,This is Tom's house.
3143778,eng,"Welcome to my house, finally."
5921308,eng,Sami won't listen to his mother.
7507533,eng,I didn't know we were supposed to do that with you.
7515924,eng,I know Tom would never stop doing that.
5958461,eng,I could say nothing.
3900412,eng,"I didn't know what to say, but I called her anyway."
554190,eng,"I'm not disturbing you, am I?"
293405,eng,He has a face which is easy to understand.
306660,eng,They are much taller than us.
5851018,eng,I told Tom it was OK for him to do that.
2237004,eng,Tom isn't progressing.
7152509,eng,Tom thought Mary was probably still somewhere in Australia.
26810,eng,"Because of rain, we couldn't go to the beach."
3918248,eng,We've got to find him first.
3174419,eng,The color of it is red.
3907349,eng,What happened to her in Boston?
269801,eng,From what time to what time is your office open?
4884060,eng,"As you'd expect from a high-end model, the user settings are amazingly detailed. It seems like it'll be a while until I can get one of my own."
6528521,eng,Tom considered telling Mary to do that.
6509562,eng,Tom and Mary said they now regret not doing that.
3341277,eng,Apple tried hard to design beautiful hardware.
1656435,eng,I knew he didn't die.
7494030,eng,Where did Tom find that?
64542,eng,Here they come.
7182406,eng,Tom said that he I thought that I should do that myself.
2774038,eng,You need a new hat.
5216323,eng,I'm confident I can do it.
5353375,eng,I saw Tom in Boston last month.
2111811,eng,How tragic!
4498987,eng,"If Tom goes, I'll go with him."
6220767,eng,Both Tom and I were drunk.
3360834,eng,"When did they start working? ""They've been working since eight o'clock and they're very tired."""
6222125,eng,Tom says he's done that already.
5170572,eng,Where can I buy a map?
1916676,eng,The girls hope to meet white boys in Blackpool.
4256400,eng,At present I am working for a median university.
1316125,eng,He loves music.
2427794,eng,The boy bent back to look up at his father's face.
6492187,eng,Do you remember when Tom and Mary were here last?
7163848,eng,I wanted to live in Australia.
3905034,eng,How can you trust her?
6521321,eng,What else do Tom and Mary want?
7227666,eng,I don't think that you understand.
5736254,eng,We need long-term solutions.
2700771,eng,"I asked him out, but he said no."
7134777,eng,I've been a biologist for over thirty years.
6576009,eng,Sami made a curious choice.
3447025,eng,Tom is making himself a sandwich.
64930,eng,My aunt has three children.
6574060,eng,Look at how rail thin she was while picking apples during the Depression.
251582,eng,You've cut my hair too short.
505921,eng,She's rather clueless.
7131189,eng,Tom is likely going to be punished.
7397420,eng,She said she wanted to go sailing.
7173036,eng,I thought that Tom wasn't making any sense.
3205243,eng,You should tell Tom that you don't plan to be in Boston next week.
5282407,eng,Appealing to the lowest common denominator is a sure-fire way to get sales or votes.
43505,eng,The next day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee.
3722911,eng,Tom might have been sleeping at that time.
2258419,eng,He makes fun of everybody.
2569555,eng,My house is situated in a convenient place - near the train station.
6925049,eng,Two weird men are sitting in a truck outside.
1925930,eng,Does anyone know the Japanese language?
1947,eng,"Jason was a taciturn individual, so it was always a real surprise when he said anything."
4042356,eng,They saw the ship.
301229,eng,He had to feed his large family.
6806827,eng,Sami sent Layla an e-mail.
7470730,eng,Tom and Mary say that they can't believe anybody.
7230887,eng,I don't think that Tom can walk without a cane.
4615639,eng,Mifune has named his dog Maggy May.
31119,eng,It's fruit fresh from the tree.
2639882,eng,Tom will never understand why people don't like him.
29189,eng,We will play Minami High School tomorrow.
3791357,eng,I saw a large snake today.
5178429,eng,Let's change the rules.
2325,eng,Look carefully. I'm going to show you how it's done.
2682743,eng,"I called him a few times, but he hasn't called back."
5366843,eng,Italian and Spanish are very similar.
244228,eng,The judge sentenced him to a jail term of five years.
286367,eng,His wife is in the hospital because she was injured in a car crash.
269301,eng,Will you tell me how to get to Shinjuku?
3722824,eng,I had to make you trust me.
2121200,eng,I caught him cheating on the exam.
3618657,eng,Tom has agreed to help us clean out the garage.
3563667,eng,All colours will agree in the dark.
7152579,eng,My grandkids live in Australia.
305677,eng,They came to our aid at once.
6421391,eng,Mary was shocked when I told her that.
2624338,eng,We should always try to help others.
6334724,eng,Who did Tom plan to stay with in Boston?
379774,eng,I was accustomed to heat.
6912908,eng,"You're the only one who knows how to do that, aren't you?"
5842820,eng,How do you know what to buy?
3726628,eng,Maybe it's time you got to know Tom better.
908805,eng,Tell us a cultural experience you have experienced.
7736107,eng,The engine is making strange noises.
6348404,eng,Tom wouldn't answer my questions.
3060436,eng,Tom doesn't understand me the way you do.
3155619,eng,Put the box down.
6342029,eng,What made you think I had to do that again?
2407742,eng,I think I can find the time.
240415,eng,There were a crowd of people in the park.
7383008,eng,He made it himself.
5747583,eng,Tom needs to get a grip.
1133535,eng,My favorite pizza is Pizza Hawaii.
7391255,eng,She thought her house was haunted.
6263811,eng,Tom doesn't think he'll do that.
6355384,eng,I don't think Tom knows why Mary does that.
6517262,eng,Tom and Mary do that because they want to.
5150133,eng,The grapes from this vine are good.
5774143,eng,I know Tom loves living here.
559672,eng,"Good morning, ladies and gentlemen!"
4012001,eng,What size boots do you wear?
6802941,eng,Each one of my bothers has a large car.
2646837,eng,Tom was already here.
6247773,eng,I wonder if Tom wants to do that.
6135052,eng,Sami reported Layla missing after just a few hours.
1578677,eng,"Unfortunately, I don't have time today."
6341399,eng,I'll have to finish this work by next Monday.
6221101,eng,Doing that may be dangerous.
6177333,eng,Sami was convicted as an accessory to the murder of Layla.
7324655,eng,Tom wants to learn how to ride a horse.
7299086,eng,Sami can't go to school.
5679087,eng,I couldn't have wished for a better gift this Christmas.
5849298,eng,Tom pricked the balloon with a pin.
797499,eng,Please do not open the windows.
6873972,eng,Tom must have retired or died.
7398576,eng,She said that she wasn't thirsty.
4753790,eng,I work in a travel agency.
7278819,eng,Sami stayed in front of me.
7587498,eng,There are a lot of things we have to get to this afternoon.
7180201,eng,Tom said that he's broke.
4281841,eng,Cassava is a drought-tolerant crop and consequently a major staple food for millions of people.
7444874,eng,They told me they didn't agree.
7731345,eng,Tom is the only one here that doesn't know how to speak French.
6870195,eng,I thought I could have done better.
6500096,eng,I don't think Tom and Mary are going to study French next year.
7375033,eng,"Mary is an ophthalmologist, isn't she?"
7404262,eng,She said she felt terrific.
6340994,eng,Would it be better to do that now or tomorrow?
49975,eng,"The building is to be fifteen stories high, and built to resist earthquakes."
4638695,eng,I'm gonna call the police!
1815756,eng,My girlfriend is crying.
7174103,eng,I thought that I heard Tom singing.
278879,eng,The weather was getting worse and worse.
6251068,eng,Tom said he almost forgot to do that.
1490721,eng,She's been sick since last Wednesday.
53416,eng,After a while she began to play the piano again.
6628829,eng,"As I got the train, I didn't think I wouldn't return any more."
2537194,eng,Tom was making a sandwich when Mary came into the kitchen.
6430357,eng,Tom said Mary was planning to eat lunch at Chuck's Diner.
2713765,eng,You're blushing.
7174758,eng,Tom thought Mary didn't drive a car.
907412,eng,"On one occasion Aristotle was asked how much educated men were superior to those uneducated: ""As much,"" said he, ""as the living are to the dead."""
3724154,eng,There's always a catch.
6408334,eng,Mary was hoping she could go to Boston with Tom next summer.
5840476,eng,I never wrote to Tom.
2754816,eng,I just wanted to see how you've been doing.
6492597,eng,Tom and Mary said they thought John would be sleeping by the time they got home.
3721954,eng,There was no sound.
3565124,eng,He sat in on some of the board's policy-making meetings.
6417747,eng,Mary said she was going to do that herself.
6912743,eng,Tom and Mary aren't eating.
5971829,eng,I'm going to eat a peach.
6408817,eng,Mary would be very disappointed if she saw you doing that.
7384801,eng,She did all of her homework.
6777285,eng,Sami sent this to me.
70577,eng,Please tell me about your hobbies.
305993,eng,They bargained additional rations of bread and milk.
7178771,eng,Tom said that Mary is probably still lost.
44672,eng,The width of the road is insufficient for safe driving.
3618532,eng,Tom is getting a little worried.
1754132,eng,Every man is a suffering-machine and a happiness-machine combined.
4049063,eng,They moved in recently.
2018488,eng,She acts mysterious.
1283609,eng,Finding the optimal for a numerical function can be an important challenge.
7111097,eng,I hope that Tom isn't absent.
2660372,eng,The municipal government is at their wits' end concerning the garbage problem.
2892129,eng,There isn't time to do that.
7388412,eng,He has sold the rest of his books.
6234399,eng,Tom said he didn't want to go camping next weekend.
7143689,eng,I didn't think we could do that by ourselves.
66914,eng,How foolish I was not to discover that simple lie!
245072,eng,It is said that the weather on the mountain changes easily.
298888,eng,He considered himself lucky.
2406526,eng,I slept on the couch.
1093218,eng,Tom makes up stories all the time.
6124036,eng,I told Tom that he shouldn't do that.
7127603,eng,How can you be sure what the Bible says is true?
6601402,eng,There's a BMI checkpoint ahead. They're calculating people's BMI and making them pay a fat tax.
7243249,eng,Sami processed the payment.
4016779,eng,"According to Tom, Mary has sold her car."
6873488,eng,Do you have to go so soon?
63849,eng,Have you finished talking?
6236362,eng,Tom is the only one who doesn't seem to be busy.
3215782,eng,Mette is Jørgen's wife.
6652101,eng,Tom said that he wanted to quit the band.
2249388,eng,Just back away.
6355608,eng,Tom seemed pretty happy.
6236639,eng,Do you get along well with your mother-in-law?
2540758,eng,Tom would've been proud of you.
292828,eng,He is still here.
2203199,eng,You're popular.
3636326,eng,Why did you choose me?
284651,eng,I cannot thank him enough.
3958665,eng,Copernicus studied mathematics and astronomy at the University of Krakow.
34978,eng,"In Hawaii, one can swim in the ocean all year round."
6583740,eng,So we're all in agreement?
3734127,eng,I'll do as you wish.
327547,eng,That makes me disgusted just to think of it.
1093248,eng,Tom lost his eyesight.
7735282,eng,I've been told that sometimes I'm cruel.
3911716,eng,They'll take care of him.
2396165,eng,I wish you hadn't found me.
6220017,eng,Tom is a millennial.
7171358,eng,I thought that you said that you were willing to help us find Tom.
1681867,eng,I cannot assemble this engine. I have no experience.
35169,eng,Quit talking like you've got something stuck in your mouth and say what you mean.
6409817,eng,Mary admitted she didn't do what we had asked her to do.
6650774,eng,Tom said that he'd like to know why Mary needed to do that.
6408158,eng,Mary said she wouldn't be able to help weed the garden today.
4016454,eng,Tom explained the rules to Mary in detail.
6336003,eng,I'd have done that if I'd had more time.
6412885,eng,Mary has enough money to buy everything she needs.
306066,eng,They were all so tired that they could do nothing but yawn.
2687384,eng,I didn't expect any gift.
6648447,eng,Tom said that he thought that Mary wasn't having fun.
4890070,eng,I don't feel safe anymore.
260914,eng,I took him to the Kyoto Imperial Palace.
6424896,eng,Mary finished the work by herself.
1837807,eng,The iPhone 5 was released yesterday.
3919005,eng,Don't forget to call him.
2477775,eng,What he says is very true.
6527416,eng,Tom doesn't plan on staying here much longer.
2548336,eng,I'll deal with this.
6092592,eng,The boy has been kidnapped.
4493750,eng,Tom had an alibi.
7506908,eng,I didn't know you weren't supposed to do that today.
3444378,eng,Tom walks faster than Mary.
7171333,eng,I thought that you said you were interested in doing that.
1028167,eng,Tom purposely wore his shirt inside out just to irritate Mary.
300308,eng,I doubt if he will succeed.
7164296,eng,I left Australia three years ago.
3903897,eng,I think I'd better go with you.
7165222,eng,Sami has never seen Layla wear a cross necklace.
7239938,eng,I did the very best I could.
7240981,eng,"Tom is doing well so far, isn't he?"
5281079,eng,There is no cure for the disease.
5822632,eng,Tom found a way to get it done.
261975,eng,I thought it wiser to hold my tongue.
292975,eng,He lives as if he were a millionaire.
3813253,eng,I found a tree frog on the wall in my bathroom.
3921196,eng,I don't know who's coming.
2047756,eng,He became dispirited.
4889967,eng,I still don't know what I should do.
6040553,eng,Sami is driving me crazy.
255287,eng,I asked Tom about his new book.
7130273,eng,Tom and I became dependent on one another.
59378,eng,This old building isn't worth fixing up. It would be better to tear it down.
1868262,eng,Tom hasn't done much in a while.
2729775,eng,We have gained weight.
5652576,eng,Tom has a warped sense of humor.
2387444,eng,I need a ladder so I can get up to my roof.
6259158,eng,Tom has been rather busy recently.
3185257,eng,Please stay right where you are.
238765,eng,Let me take your blood pressure.
3091499,eng,Are you sure Tom can do this?
59655,eng,This bridge bears only ten tons.
2230250,eng,I wasn't looking at you.
6106976,eng,Layla was the future of our family.
6043579,eng,Layla's death didn't serve any purpose.
467853,eng,He's very good at guitar.
5674147,eng,Fortunately Mary felt the same way as did Tom.
6274033,eng,Tom and I'll help you.
289560,eng,He won but only at a price.
6213464,eng,Tom looked into the mirror and saw an old man.
6760655,eng,Tom hasn't saved anything for retirement.
1140153,eng,I suggest we go out for a drink.
2092585,eng,I don't have anybody else to turn to.
6530047,eng,Tom didn't want to be a designer.
681589,eng,Nutrition is inadequate in some poor areas.
2723857,eng,The Toronto International Film Festival is the largest film festival in North America.
699992,eng,It was determined that the plane crashed due to pilot error.
3734025,eng,Tom might not be able to speak French.
1850254,eng,Keep an eye on Tom.
1386719,eng,"I was born in 1982 in Athens, where I still live today."
6220698,eng,Tom may be embarrassed.
287299,eng,Was it gambling that brought about his bankruptcy?
4012561,eng,Everybody is having a good time.
6658914,eng,Tom doesn't spend enough time studying.
5545919,eng,Tom never asked me to dance.
3908982,eng,I'll go tell her the good news.
65842,eng,I don't believe him at all.
6842709,eng,Tom knows that I hate spinach.
2600141,eng,I feel certain of it.
1954271,eng,Humor me.
6423366,eng,Mary looks like she'd like to leave.
1023697,eng,You'd better not talk back to Tom.
4666143,eng,"Tom has a car, doesn't he?"
1355444,eng,The desk Ken uses is old.
1961258,eng,I thought I recognized this place.
6273840,eng,Tom got Mary to speak French.
313143,eng,"She looks bad-tempered, but she is kind at heart."
2585802,eng,"I had an appointment at 2:30, but I got caught in traffic and couldn't get there in time."
5839630,eng,Fadil was sentenced to death for the killing of a young girl.
3310023,eng,We've only just started.
7444193,eng,They told me that they weren't prepared.
1961632,eng,I thought you might feel like going out for a drink.
2307960,eng,I carefully considered my options before making my decision.
6992047,eng,"The study in the journal PLOS Biology lists what the authors say are the world's 10 most charismatic animals: tigers, lions, elephants, giraffes, leopards, pandas, cheetahs, polar bears, gray wolves and gorillas. The common depiction of these animals in cartoons and movies and as toys has led to what the authors call ""virtual populations"" — people believe the animals are not at risk of extinction in the wild because they appear to be everywhere."
4628962,eng,The Klingons are a warrior spacefaring race.
6508452,eng,Tom and Mary are working on the arrangements.
7328961,eng,Sami wasn't reacting off of hate.
6661173,eng,"Tom isn't deaf, but Mary is."
2647440,eng,Tom never said that.
7474077,eng,They say they're too busy to do that.
4384211,eng,"If you push a button, either you will die or you will live."
1327057,eng,Seriously?
6647194,eng,Tom told Mary that I was afraid.
6414533,eng,Mary told Tom the story that John had told her.
2450993,eng,Tom has trouble coping with people like Mary.
6225342,eng,Tom asked me why I didn't ask anybody for help.
6410365,eng,Mary told Tom that she wouldn't be willing to do that.
1322187,eng,Bread's in the oven.
33754,eng,"Boeing's safety experts have joined others in the industry to form an international task force to try to eliminate one particular kind of air crash known as controlled flight into terrain, CFIT."
3170631,eng,Tom handed Mary the green notebook.
1961781,eng,I thought you weren't coming back.
6382877,eng,I can't even swallow.
3902445,eng,Tom ran over a passerby then flew the scene.
5374452,eng,I do not think of you.
6384460,eng,Sami wanted to stop Layla from having an abortion.
1490954,eng,"Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself."
6059294,eng,Everyone was supportive.
6249848,eng,Tom didn't look very happy to see you.
7502463,eng,I know that Tom doesn't know why Mary is doing that by herself.
6125840,eng,Tom knew that Mary was from Boston.
3757195,eng,"Oh, sighed the duckling, ""how thankful I am for being so ugly; even a dog will not bite me."""
41726,eng,I have never heard from him since.
3410978,eng,Tom is now on the phone.
4786590,eng,Tom is on a diet because he's a little overweight.
6420180,eng,Mary said she doesn't think she can win.
6256922,eng,I want to be at today's meeting.
2543398,eng,Tom dislocated his shoulder.
330441,eng,We didn't start with much money or many endorsements.
3382737,eng,I don't even care if they hate me.
6256613,eng,It'll be interesting to do that.
6809889,eng,I haven't seen Tom for weeks.
7126719,eng,It's completely devastating.
259785,eng,I like my meat well done.
3185630,eng,Tom has always said I have a sick sense of humor.
298257,eng,It is expected that he will succeed in the examination.
7708255,eng,The TV doesn't seem to be working.
7508524,eng,I know that Tom knows why you want me to do that.
6348294,eng,I doubt that Tom is still mad.
2958914,eng,Wait till the chairman recognizes you.
7406205,eng,They said they had to go to a meeting.
7399242,eng,He admitted that he left early.
45907,eng,Many people visited the shrine where the saint lay buried.
432909,eng,Your memory is good.
6885062,eng,Do you really think that Tom told Mary the truth?
7137400,eng,I don't love anybody more than I love you.
6926563,eng,They sacrificed a sheep.
3735063,eng,I didn't know you used to live in Boston.
3917048,eng,Did you wait for her?
1908996,eng,Promise me you won't tell Tom.
6236347,eng,Tom is trying to figure out what he needs to do.
2831179,eng,Is it an animal? Is it a plant? Is it a mineral? Is it a thing? Is it something immaterial?
6013086,eng,I know nothing about robotics.
4666052,eng,How could that ever happen?
32493,eng,You'll catch it from Mummy.
7245605,eng,Sami was genuinely worried about Layla.
6656384,eng,"Tom was friendly, but Mary wasn't."
2245732,eng,I enjoy poker.
3725131,eng,I'm just here to find out who took Tom.
318296,eng,He died within a few days of his hundredth birthday.
6351749,eng,I'll be in Boston until tomorrow.
4663626,eng,Tom asked me to do his homework for him.
5206947,eng,Tom is someone I look up to.
2254720,eng,Who found him?
2643395,eng,Don't go anywhere without me.
6970469,eng,Let Tom know what you plan to do.
7106231,eng,Are we sure about this?
1027057,eng,Tom ate some spicy Indian food.
3818016,eng,"You really do change your opinions often, don't you?"
7733378,eng,I asked my boss for a raise.
694090,eng,Go say goodbye to them before they leave.
1877526,eng,Tom put down a dish of food for his dog.
722661,eng,"Some systems, such as Burroughs B5500, do not use paging to implement virtual memory. Instead, they use segmentation, that divide virtual address spaces into variable-length segments. A virtual address consists of a segment number and an offset within the segment."
6678178,eng,You could've been happy.
6008609,eng,Do you guys want to go with me?
7392163,eng,He'll laugh when he sees this.
2548490,eng,We're in the house.
3635791,eng,What a terrific idea!
1365642,eng,You have a very kind wife and very good friends.
2628713,eng,I can speak Italian fluently.
4829008,eng,Sometimes even small mistakes can lead to big accidents.
7226753,eng,I don't think that that's going to work.
4855919,eng,That was an exciting game.
7253663,eng,Sami came back to visit Cairo.
2308098,eng,I could hardly refuse Tom's challenge.
2239486,eng,I have other cards up my sleeve.
6654027,eng,Tom said that he enjoys doing that.
295400,eng,I hear he is looking for work.
2647081,eng,That was our problem.
1751593,eng,He knows how to draw animals.
1027234,eng,"Tom acted happy, but deep inside he was sad."
4879938,eng,Tom is dying to know what you think.
953266,eng,Everywhere you look you can see children playing.
5839219,eng,Fadil took Dania's money.
6259565,eng,Do you mind if I use your bike?
3431240,eng,Tom is still at his desk.
5738048,eng,Tom will arrange everything.
5368862,eng,Can we give Tom a ride?
7381798,eng,Mary said she felt lonely.
4102343,eng,Tom would like to buy a house in Boston.
6700609,eng,Sami put the gun in Layla's sewing basket.
7212413,eng,Tom told me he thought that Mary had been scared.
2954986,eng,You're not supposed to do that.
559013,eng,"On my mother's side of the family, I have three male cousins."
390528,eng,"The Paris syndrome is a type of culture shock. It's a psychiatric term used to describe foreigners who start living in Paris, drawn to the image of the city as a center of fashion, don't adapt well to the local customs and culture, lose their mental balance and exhibit symptoms close to depression."
2987090,eng,Time is running short now.
7126509,eng,How did you get into radio?
3203757,eng,I've already told everybody to go home.
7152296,eng,Tom told me that he didn't want to go to Australia.
5189277,eng,I used to be tired all the time.
5975045,eng,Don't sign anything.
7386508,eng,She went back to her dorm.
3735374,eng,Tom thought that Mary would probably be willing to help.
6349748,eng,I haven't checked the doors yet.
7398619,eng,He said that he was unemployed.
3521972,eng,Have you discussed this with Tom?
6433070,eng,I don't have many friends who can speak French.
807554,eng,Jackson's men began to leave the next morning.
238199,eng,The police detected the spy.
2298153,eng,It was her idea.
6647840,eng,Tom says he always feels tense when Mary is in the room.
6241791,eng,Tom did everything he thought he should do.
6533593,eng,Tom tried to reassure her.
3087564,eng,Tom said he wanted to see us before we left.
2608292,eng,I'm an expert at programming.
6970605,eng,"If you're sleepy, you should sleep."
2396100,eng,I have a much better idea.
1444950,eng,Her bicycle is blue.
6662711,eng,Tom is wearing a white cotton shirt.
6687871,eng,I'm the only person here who can do that.
6781598,eng,I didn't realize I'd been doing that the wrong way.
3819420,eng,Try to ignore Tom.
1107899,eng,You guys get the best shots.
7503725,eng,Tom realized Mary didn't love him as much as he loved her.
7338108,eng,Sami was so ridiculous.
7131220,eng,Tom has only had three girlfriends.
262515,eng,It was raining when we arrived.
1029553,eng,Tom brought his dog over to Mary's house.
7157092,eng,Tom loves being in Australia.
3133283,eng,Tom was accused of the sexual harassment of his female colleagues.
7438956,eng,They said that they enjoyed doing that.
40313,eng,We had a lovely time at the dance.
3909408,eng,I'm not going to stop them.
6904387,eng,"Tom is a strong kid, isn't he?"
6222548,eng,Tom hasn't closed the windows yet.
2953581,eng,We can protect you.
3723030,eng,Tom was there for me when I really needed someone.
6123843,eng,Tom knew there was nothing he could do to help.
4494499,eng,It was very mysterious.
7237504,eng,Sami needs to check the order.
6492340,eng,Tom and Mary said they thought it wouldn't be safe for John to walk home by himself at night.
308590,eng,She and I usually agree.
2548438,eng,"You're with me, OK?"
2571539,eng,I enjoyed Tom's wit.
7258354,eng,Sami came to the front.
2732724,eng,Tom got lost inside the manor.
5623064,eng,We have a lot of work to do before that happens.
3283018,eng,His poems are hard to understand.
7168917,eng,I think that Tom is still nervous.
6900286,eng,I got up at 2 in the morning.
249772,eng,I have a friend who works for NASA.
6034867,eng,"Explore the cave, but bring a flashlight with you."
5725267,eng,Let's talk about the deal that was reached.
73579,eng,"Don't use ""discover"" when you mean ""invent""."
2954526,eng,You have a very impressive resume.
7177901,eng,Tom said that Mary thought that John might not have to do that again.
7510188,eng,I knew that Tom wouldn't be willing to do that.
6532116,eng,Tom paid for the meal.
2240819,eng,We're all nervous.
6522169,eng,Where have Tom and Mary gone?
3155771,eng,Tom put his fork down.
1654172,eng,I'm not the only one who feels that way.
268269,eng,Has the bell rung yet?
6783759,eng,Don't let anyone see you.
1226128,eng,What's wrong?
7539488,eng,Tom and I would like to spend some time by ourselves.
3060518,eng,She's getting married next month.
6869549,eng,You should have asked Tom for permission to do that.
6335195,eng,Tom said he doesn't plan to go with us this weekend.
6666997,eng,I didn't think Tom would be so conceited.
2044880,eng,I'd be happy to talk about this later.
1027105,eng,Tom arrived at home early yesterday.
6423032,eng,Mary told Tom that she wouldn't cry.
2642819,eng,What're you doing with my car?
6436251,eng,Tom might think you don't like Mary.
7735089,eng,Most of us have done that more than once.
6782868,eng,Sami took pictures every single day.
297869,eng,He came to my office yesterday.
6870334,eng,That could have gone better.
35062,eng,Harry couldn't keep up with the class.
3794905,eng,I don't know exactly where I am.
7507537,eng,I didn't know that you were interested in antiques.
5287949,eng,Curb extensions force traffic to slow down.
5257486,eng,"In the early 1990s, the insurgency became more intense."
3330106,eng,I'm never going to be able to do this.
6375843,eng,You're an embarassment to the family.
6873983,eng,Tom must have been astonished.
5660588,eng,I'm going by myself.
2062850,eng,I have something for Tom.
3730686,eng,What if you were able to buy the house you've always dreamed of?
6709167,eng,Sami was planning to divorce Layla.
1025901,eng,Tom doesn't want to work tomorrow.
885278,eng,"Just as it is the tendency of great minds to make one hear much with few words, small minds have a talent for talking a lot, and saying nothing."
2491837,eng,She opened her backpack.
7214736,eng,Tom told me that he didn't like speaking French.
15923,eng,You mustn't depend on others for help.
547044,eng,I can only gape at such perfection.
3820620,eng,Tom wondered when the meeting would start.
7199851,eng,I promise that I won't hit anyone.
2033577,eng,Why did you want to speak to me?
249020,eng,We are more or less selfish.
7501841,eng,I know that Tom would show Mary how to do that if she asked him to.
436765,eng,I like to go to the movies to see foreign films.
292277,eng,What a nonsense he talks.
2046873,eng,I'm afraid Tom is busy at the moment.
6348043,eng,I knew it wouldn't be that simple.
5437762,eng,Tom has a scar on his stomach.
6416958,eng,Mary said she wanted me to be here tomorrow.
1188662,eng,"Hey, did you hear? Susan has a bun in the oven."
2275171,eng,Don't be afraid to experiment.
7389184,eng,She's riding her bike.
6482423,eng,I've never smoked a cigarette in my life.
3920538,eng,Are you worried about them?
3204564,eng,I'll tell you if you promise not to tell Tom.
2957563,eng,Tom noticed that not all the kids were paying attention.
5090385,eng,"No, I won't say anything."
5850652,eng,I got beaten up.
5079323,eng,Tom has a younger brother.
3735151,eng,Please write that down.
1894176,eng,The school is closed because of the snow.
304160,eng,He was sleeping under the tree.
320387,eng,Some people are anxious to invent convenient things.
6164879,eng,At this moment I can't find the appropriate words.
6462615,eng,"Where is Tom? ""He is sick."""
308006,eng,You must be careful that she doesn't fall over the cliff.
6872869,eng,I'm sorry that I couldn't help you.
2548712,eng,I'm in command now.
5737415,eng,How does one celebrate that?
6647553,eng,"Tom thinks if he had done that, Mary would've been upset."
6046897,eng,We should get a new lamp.
1966,eng,A miser hoards money not because he is prudent but because he is greedy.
5064709,eng,"Murder, rape, and torture are atrocities associated with times of war."
1848739,eng,Somebody's knocking at your door.
6474557,eng,Sami read multiple chapters of the Bible every day.
7561758,eng,This is written in Arabic.
2952904,eng,I've explained the problem to Tom.
1587443,eng,I forgot about it again.
432340,eng,I was a teacher.
1868043,eng,Tom looks proud of his son.
2870669,eng,Mary will follow Tom.
7470885,eng,Tom and Mary have no plans for their retirement.
3688033,eng,Would you like ice cream?
314266,eng,She is like a mother to me.
454439,eng,Don't stick your nose where it doesn't belong.
6496427,eng,Tom and Mary said they intend to go to Australia next October.
64961,eng,I want to teach history when I grow up.
6264987,eng,Tom doesn't think Mary will be sympathetic.
7150077,eng,Tom's last year in Australia was 2013.
315572,eng,She told her son to wait a minute.
3738348,eng,What has Tom been up to?
2408601,eng,I think you know what you should do.
6084361,eng,They're not here for you.
6528276,eng,Tom is going to visit Boston next month.
1680059,eng,This is the first time I've ever shot with a rifle.
2040417,eng,"An authentic production will be recognized as such by any native speaker of sufficient experience, but the experience sufficient to one production may not suffice to another."
41985,eng,The new houses are of a uniform height.
6530373,eng,Have you met your new neighbors?
2958481,eng,Tom wants to live in Boston after he graduates from high school.
6322775,eng,I feel an aversion toward all this exhibitionism.
6075521,eng,This is common.
2951771,eng,Do you still play golf?
7486928,eng,Where did she sleep last night?
4235700,eng,What's all the commotion about anyway?
5869185,eng,"It was after midnight, and Fadil and Layla were sleeping."
3286805,eng,Tom has nothing to do.
3476799,eng,Tom recommended that I apply for the job.
1691379,eng,I just got a good idea.
4499489,eng,I had a long conversation with Tom about that.
6654397,eng,Tom said that he didn't want to be a janitor anymore.
2093293,eng,You better not open your mouth.
261255,eng,I'm anxious about her health.
3152572,eng,Can't you give me some advice?
7237952,eng,Sami was seen with a confederate flag.
2670418,eng,But why doesn't she shut up?
3486337,eng,Tom says it's an emergency.
7404995,eng,She told me she did that.
52434,eng,The switch didn't work on time.
4663960,eng,Tom has been waiting for three hours.
2924400,eng,Tom pulled a key out of his pocket and unlocked the door.
4014042,eng,Why should I trust you now?
6728569,eng,I didn't know that Tom was the one who was supposed to do that.
6326445,eng,Sami started taking my clothes off.
6961116,eng,Conditions could change.
7231754,eng,I don't think that it'll be easy.
7390845,eng,She redoubled her efforts.
7392537,eng,He told everybody he was skeptical.
7388386,eng,He's passed all his exams.
5452063,eng,I thought everyone liked bananas.
6049382,eng,Play ball!
65663,eng,"Waiter, I'd like to order."
33861,eng,Bern is the capital of Switzerland.
7504694,eng,I know that Tom doesn't know he shouldn't be doing that.
1675694,eng,She is not ashamed of her misconduct.
6447752,eng,Muslims believe that Jesus was one of God's messengers.
6174172,eng,Her eyes sparkle with joy.
301440,eng,He behaved himself like a man.
2952939,eng,"If Tom doesn't do what he's supposed to do, please let me know."
264900,eng,A dictionary defines words.
5850447,eng,I'm not as rich as you think I am.
16072,eng,You may as well prepare for your examination.
2494573,eng,It's better to be a shallow stream than a deep vortex.
5859844,eng,I became a teacher when I was thirty.
2712824,eng,We both know what needs to be done.
5737647,eng,We'll hold you accountable.
21353,eng,His stock with the students has soared.
6530187,eng,Tom said that he was really mad.
6576023,eng,Sami was an Evangelist.
1123778,eng,Gasoline is no longer a cheap fuel.
6657303,eng,I don't think Tom is tempted to do that.
238080,eng,Policemen cleared the way to let cars pass.
280983,eng,The sacred ritual took place after being postponed twice.
5796720,eng,"For the maximum frequency allowed by the blood bank, Tom gladly donates blood."
6023019,eng,"If you don't bother them, they won't bother you."
795032,eng,Paris during the Indian summer is an earthly heaven.
531485,eng,"I like that university, but it's too near my home."
2969073,eng,Tom looks like he's having a bad day.
6256841,eng,I wish I didn't need to do that.
2270517,eng,Don't play with matches.
3237219,eng,"Oh yes, that's right."
15790,eng,I think you had better call on him.
7214625,eng,Tom told me that he thought he had a chance of winning.
7734478,eng,Tom is really aggressive.
19564,eng,Rub salt in the wound.
5849602,eng,Tom can't do it all by himself.
5701017,eng,I don't think that's very likely to happen.
7399806,eng,She said that she felt left out.
243856,eng,I was recently in an automobile accident.
6234124,eng,How many years have you already spent doing that?
7470636,eng,Tom and Mary realized that they needed to do that.
6501241,eng,I don't think Tom and Mary have any experience doing that.
3170553,eng,Tom was wearing dark brown shoes.
5725245,eng,We're all trying to make names for ourselves.
5296744,eng,Do you want to see a movie that's both entertaining and thought-provoking?
2892274,eng,This one is clean.
2744740,eng,Does Tom ever write letters in French?
3868832,eng,We must get there before them.
322549,eng,"If anything bad should come about, let me know."
4834053,eng,Austria is one of the largest producers of electricity in Europe.
1699402,eng,It's popular among senior citizens.
3970812,eng,She is worried about her health.
6253778,eng,I didn't have to work last Monday.
5624904,eng,Tom is very impressionable.
6667111,eng,"Tom is dependable, but Mary isn't."
7186741,eng,I almost went to Australia last month.
6225728,eng,Tom says there were no children in the park.
808717,eng,Have you arrived yet?
7737929,eng,Tom and Mary were right.
3227119,eng,Our profits exceeded even the most optimistic estimates announced last year.
7184411,eng,I don't often come to Australia.
2954163,eng,What's gotten into you anyway?
7159645,eng,I'll stay with my uncle in Australia.
6490470,eng,Tom and Mary said they were planning to go in Boston next summer.
6427516,eng,Mary told me she'd stay home.
2315301,eng,I don't know what Tom wanted.
755289,eng,Milk doesn't last long in warm weather.
7437960,eng,Tom and Mary told me they wanted to stay single.
7230764,eng,I don't think that Tom has to decide that today.
7505337,eng,I didn't know that you expected me to do that with you.
6351016,eng,Tom told me he wasn't so sure.
3582262,eng,"It's three hundred miles to London, give or take ten."
7156852,eng,Tom moved here from Australia three years ago.
6567111,eng,Sami was very impressed with Layla's perseverance and drive.
393246,eng,"A banker is a fellow who lends you his umbrella when the sun is shining, but wants it back the minute it begins to rain."

6785704,eng,"My dream is know Roma, in the Italy."
6265215,eng,Don't you intend to do that?
508349,eng,Never lose hope.
6422429,eng,Mary said she wanted to be a dentist.
3823842,eng,Tom wondered what Mary was trying to say to him.
6255549,eng,Tom says he doesn't think Mary really wanted to do that.
4664121,eng,Tom doesn't need to wait any longer.
3388093,eng,"As I was waking up, I saw a burglar in my room."
6728563,eng,I didn't know Tom was able to do that.
7507261,eng,I know that Tom knows that I'm planning to do that.
3249294,eng,They now have three children.
1687035,eng,I cannot repeat the year. I must pass the exam.
4016105,eng,What are you doing home so early?
6530288,eng,Tom doesn't want to be the boss.
36039,eng,I managed to get out of the crowd.
2537139,eng,Tom started playing the piano when he was thirteen years old.
3821698,eng,Tom is checking things out.
2014053,eng,Who'd ever want to leave here?
4501969,eng,We saw the airplane.
1908577,eng,Go to your room!
968293,eng,She was busy with the housework.
7131083,eng,Tom and Mary are beautiful together.
4269259,eng,Why did you buy this car?
6247371,eng,I didn't know Tom was your father.
6344931,eng,Tom almost never goes swimming anymore.
2954563,eng,You implied that you were a doctor.
6491089,eng,Tom and Mary did that whenever they had a chance to.
2111358,eng,They struggled.
314810,eng,She comes to school in her car.
6211701,eng,"Her sisters burst out a-laughing, and began to banter her. The gentleman who was sent to try the slipper looked earnestly at Cinderella, and, finding her very handsome, said it was but just that she should try, and that he had orders to let every lady try it on."
7240111,eng,I know that that's important to you.
6900688,eng,I went to sit down where you sat this morning and I heard what you had thought.
39022,eng,"Opening the door, I found a stranger standing there."
7182953,eng,Tom refused to admit he'd done that.
7515594,eng,Tom realized we didn't have to do that.
6265375,eng,Tom thinks Mary won't be ready to do that.
3302689,eng,What else do you need to do today?
5221366,eng,I expected Tom to win.
2111605,eng,Loosen it.
402881,eng,I like to go and watch baseball games.
1839444,eng,Can I make copies?
3991484,eng,It's impossible to deny the obvious.
7444909,eng,They told me they want to win.
7286582,eng,Sami kept looking over at Layla.
6501631,eng,Didn't you know that Tom and Mary were going to be there?
5628550,eng,They reneged on the agreement.
6238009,eng,I should've listened to Tom more carefully.
6233535,eng,I hope Tom is unhurt.
1693484,eng,"Protect the power cord from being walked on or pinched particularly at plugs, convenience receptacles and the point where they exit from the apparatus."
7247656,eng,"I needed your help, but I couldn't find you."
5194195,eng,I want my children to go to college.
909559,eng,She spends all her time thinking about boys.
2249032,eng,It's already happening.
5736379,eng,Tom was screaming and crying.
6422172,eng,Mary told me that she was frustrated.
3024388,eng,How do you like Boston?
247748,eng,We have heard of your success in the exam.
3913208,eng,Let her get some rest.
2891173,eng,Everybody was out to get me.
278967,eng,"Genius must be born, and never can be taught."
2542632,eng,I used to want more than this.
2059861,eng,My parents worry about my health.
2288235,eng,"You're wearing eyeliner, aren't you?"
1311601,eng,"When you meet someone for the first time, be careful about how close you stand to that person."
3129496,eng,What happened in the park?
3737090,eng,Bring your tool box.
6852709,eng,My guess is that Tom will do that today.
1994369,eng,I don't want to get in trouble.
2026115,eng,She has a headache.
296586,eng,He brought his lunch today.
395916,eng,Everyone says the food in this restaurant is both delicious and inexpensive.
1482667,eng,Tom was involved in a street brawl.
6656102,eng,I don't think I'll be able to keep Tom from doing that.
892716,eng,"To conceal anything from those to whom I am attached, is not in my nature. I can never close my lips where I have opened my heart."
7402631,eng,She told me she wasn't bored.
7240649,eng,I know that I won't like it in Boston.
6267836,eng,I should help you do that.
240404,eng,His study of optics led him to the invention of the magnifying glass.
284669,eng,He has a son whose name is John.
2449368,eng,He rolled up his sleeves.
3823416,eng,I finally was able to do it.
7644701,eng,I haven't seen her for a year.
7505363,eng,I didn't know Tom knew why we couldn't do that for him.
1288654,eng,"This computer is excellent, but it cost me a fortune."
7476850,eng,They dyed their hair.
3329736,eng,Can you please write that down?
3500828,eng,I saw a drunk lying on the road.
6610394,eng,The practical exam is the day after tomorrow.
5138191,eng,Take a deep breath and don't freak out.
2123565,eng,That's done.
52410,eng,Susan left an hour ago.
46394,eng,The boy took great pains to solve the quiz.
6347971,eng,I think I'd like to eat right now.
2467138,eng,That sounds like a bad idea.
251055,eng,My car is being repaired.
7405033,eng,She says she's exhausted.
35158,eng,Please open your bag.
5746289,eng,"Let's stay calm, people."
6439240,eng,It's going to get dark soon.
7114516,eng,It's freezing here.
3256251,eng,That costs how much?
4529194,eng,Would you mind answering a few questions?
2033700,eng,Tom didn't want to keep Mary waiting.
2400720,eng,"Every politician must be responsive to complaints from the public, or he or she will become inflexible and make disastrous decisions."
2953931,eng,We're not ready to go yet.
4512517,eng,She liked partying with friends and drinking.
3287197,eng,There was nothing Tom could've done.
906138,eng,We tried to put out the fire but we were unsuccessful. We had to call the fire brigade.
5996035,eng,My horse likes apples.
5168864,eng,I wish I could see Tom.
5801503,eng,I don't believe anything you say anymore.
6654316,eng,Tom said that he didn't want to live in Boston anymore.
2314823,eng,I did as I was told.
44399,eng,The television serial is getting more and more interesting.
2756525,eng,The policemen had already left.
6675821,eng,I suspect that's true.
259054,eng,I had intended to visit the temple last week.
7505198,eng,I know Tom would get angry if you did that without him.
7130536,eng,Tom takes Mary's kindness for granted.
71873,eng,The beard does not make the philosopher.
5446151,eng,A gerontologist suggested that better palliative care facilities for patients who are nearing the end of their lives might be better than legalizing assisted suicide.
3906929,eng,Are you related to me?
6408599,eng,Mary told Tom that she couldn't do what he asked her to do.
3728082,eng,Stock prices could skyrocket.
6336675,eng,I wonder if Tom likes Boston.
6374290,eng,I fell asleep on top of Sami.
4496521,eng,Tom has denied cheating.
2821418,eng,Are you planning on staying?
3904090,eng,Be careful with her.
6335588,eng,That's the way most people do that.
4016074,eng,Did you find anything else?
7398606,eng,She said that she was very tired.
6254259,eng,"You're a Red Sox fan, aren't you?"
6261115,eng,I don't normally speak French.
396223,eng,You should listen to his advice.
4633583,eng,There's a dictionary on top of the desk.
3596589,eng,The man is writing in the notebook.
5633171,eng,I guess you're better than Tom.
7134331,eng,"What are you chewing, big brother? a few last year's gum."
5350423,eng,"Last time, I watched an amazing film."
5928566,eng,Her performance was painfully cringeworthy.
5126571,eng,Tom and Mary kissed each other goodnight.
2544363,eng,I wasn't talking about you.
4261778,eng,It would be better with your younger sister.
6526560,eng,Tom said that Mary was sure that John would do that.
6386367,eng,Sami got Layla pregnant and left her without even saying a word.
6265417,eng,Tom should probably tell Mary he's hungry.
6912932,eng,"You're too old to be doing this kind of thing, aren't you?"
5850122,eng,Perhaps I ought to tell Tom that I don't like him anymore.
239539,eng,Everything is all right now.
2254942,eng,You can try.
7408247,eng,They walked down the hall by themselves.
4864293,eng,Food processors are convenient for slicing vegetables.
3390826,eng,I love you and I don't want anything bad to happen to you.
3164493,eng,I've discovered Tom's secret formula.
7518435,eng,I know Tom is afraid of Mary's dog.
6492726,eng,Tom and Mary said they don't think John really needed to do that this morning.
7511720,eng,I know Tom is a really close friend of yours.
3918804,eng,How are you going to catch her?
960876,eng,At what time do you exit from the office?
6438942,eng,This furniture was expensive.
7229768,eng,We need a plan B.
2357751,eng,They have a good time.
4071698,eng,"Your Majesty, here I come — uh-oh, ah! ""Ow! You shitface! You crashed into me!"" ""Has your face been harmed? I'm sorry."" ""No shit, Sherlock! Look at my face."" ""Your face looks fine to me."" ""It hurts."" ""Whatever."" ""Fix my face."" ""..."" ""Fix it!"" ""Whatever."""
7226452,eng,I don't think that Tom wanted to talk about that.
3109307,eng,I am giving you an order.
7217489,eng,I was afraid that I might not be able to do it correctly.
2522534,eng,They never get old.
6508524,eng,Tom and Mary are going to take a quick break.
311133,eng,She was surprised at the news.
6352666,eng,Tom told me he didn't smoke.
6708922,eng,Sami is in the middle of a lawsuit.
7443462,eng,They told us that they'd study French.
5903485,eng,How many people named Tom do you know?
7732795,eng,Tom has told Mary everything.
689894,eng,Don't take out anything from the bag.
6260914,eng,Tom never felt sorry for himself.
6690630,eng,Sami had some physical problems.
1127414,eng,"If God had consulted me before embarking on the creation of the planets, I would have suggested a simpler system."
7182253,eng,Tom said he was glad that he'd done that.
245889,eng,Children grow up so quickly.
7116991,eng,"You're not ready for this, are you?"
7507921,eng,I know that Tom is going to find out who did that.
28763,eng,We rid his house of mice.
3422027,eng,Tom's Mary's brother.
3520610,eng,The liver is no longer functioning.
6657803,eng,I'm going to be here for a couple more hours.
7179675,eng,Tom said that his parents let him do anything he wants to do.
6976340,eng,"She seemed for an instant to wish to shrink back inside the house again; and then, seeing how useless all concealment must be, she came forward, with a very white face and frightened eyes which belied the smile upon her lips."
3121889,eng,"At the end of the day, it doesn't matter."
6221283,eng,Tom will be an uncle.
3643362,eng,It's a job that would help me pay for my studies.
7409501,eng,They say you keep hanging up on them.
23776,eng,I'll expect to hear from you by Tuesday.
6509602,eng,Tom and Mary said they didn't often go to Boston.
282480,eng,We have two deliveries every day.
2241529,eng,We'd better hurry.
3444535,eng,Tom lied about the matter.
7394474,eng,He said that he did nothing wrong.
6576669,eng,He's been an inspiration to us all.
6841582,eng,Do you have many scars?
5366315,eng,I saw the data.
2643093,eng,Why did you disobey my order?
6440511,eng,Tom really did die.
6587010,eng,You can discover something new every day.
7279253,eng,Sami didn't know Layla like that.
2954945,eng,You're hardly ever here anymore.
5879460,eng,That was probably the mistake Fadil made.
5112560,eng,His car lost control in a roundabout and flipped.
7516084,eng,I knew that Tom wanted to do that here.
5831767,eng,"I can't go through the Haunted Wood, cried Anne desperately."
7240743,eng,"You know I like you, don't you?"
2985639,eng,I'm running short of cash.
4855735,eng,The first snowplows were drawn by horses.
6334681,eng,Would it be all right if I let Tom do that?
3426441,eng,Tom used to be famous.
7440946,eng,They said they're afraid.
5858401,eng,I sat on the curb.
2955880,eng,Tom appears to be happy.
6491466,eng,I wonder if Tom and Mary are thirsty.
1093374,eng,Tom just took a chance and called Mary to ask her out.
7395291,eng,He wasn't sure how he could help.
2649602,eng,Tom fired a couple of shots in our direction.
5715976,eng,Tom is around thirty.
497944,eng,We were able to see the sunset from our window.
6520652,eng,Tom and Mary invited me to their home.
6659464,eng,Please put the milk in the refrigerator.
6438488,eng,Tom should talk to his lawyer.
7528183,eng,Like attracts like.
7509707,eng,Tom said that he thought that I had to do that.
326663,eng,"Argument continues about the ""White collar exemption"" that exempts specific white collar workers from the ""8 hours in 1 day, 40 hours a week,"" working hours fixed by the Labour Standards Act."
6334587,eng,"You're not really planning on going, are you?"
2544845,eng,I'll need you to be there.
4219345,eng,You can't keep secrets from me.
6348912,eng,I guess you can't do that either.
3818154,eng,I intend to do that for you.
5725775,eng,Nobody knows what the future holds?
6868300,eng,Tom should have been handcuffed.
7182019,eng,"If ever Tiber and the fields I see / washed by her waves, ere mingling with the brine, / and build the city which the Fates decree, / then kindred towns and neighbouring folk shall join, / yours in Epirus, in Hesperia mine, / and linked thenceforth in sorrow and in joy, / with Dardanus the founder of each line, / so let posterity its pains employ, / two nations, one in heart, shall make another Troy."
6427002,eng,Mary thought I'd let her down.
7733522,eng,Let's go for a bike ride.
2293490,eng,I barely even remember Tom.
7393698,eng,She can be helpful when she wants to.
290145,eng,He ran a great risk in the jungle.
30870,eng,"If it were not for your help, I could not run this store."
5823293,eng,Has Jamal been around?
3001355,eng,Tom decided to help out.
1908941,eng,Everything has been arranged.
3417001,eng,"Tom is quite persuasive, isn't he?"
3727597,eng,Tom paused to collect his thoughts.
243775,eng,How is livelihood in America these day?
3934335,eng,We're staying there for three months.
6500184,eng,Tom and Mary are still trying to figure out why that happened.
3724805,eng,Tom's curiosity got the better of him.
6576781,eng,The new year will bring changes.
1943884,eng,Stop it. You're making me blush.
6520601,eng,Are Tom and Mary finished eating?
1766785,eng,"I love you, Laurie."
6788752,eng,Have you ever gone out with Tom?
6663302,eng,Tom didn't seem to be as tempted to do that as Mary seemed to be.
690920,eng,Please answer either by nodding or shaking your head.
2064661,eng,I need to get something.
3147934,eng,The price is three hundred dollars.
7439841,eng,They told me they were suspicious.
275143,eng,The sun is so distant from the earth.
7306914,eng,Sami's parents decided to have a divorce.
2640769,eng,Tom and Mary must really hate each other.
4530023,eng,It was an amazing movie.
7196697,eng,Tom didn't seem to be surprised Mary wasn't able to do that.
2283745,eng,It's serious.
6786276,eng,"May I talk to Tom, please?"
319262,eng,My father must have been handsome in his youth.
6517747,eng,No one knew Tom and Mary were there.
7211801,eng,Tom told me he thought that Mary was bipolar.
3877454,eng,She's convinced she has an insect inside her head.
1833380,eng,And pigs might fly!
6221832,eng,Tom will have to figure it out.
7131914,eng,Aren't you getting a divorce?
6873966,eng,I think I must have dreamed it.
2911074,eng,Are you afraid of heights?
4645007,eng,"Tom! Where are you? ""I'm here!"" ""But where is here?"""
313068,eng,She will get over the shock soon.
7279803,eng,Sami was packing up the diaper bag.
3408763,eng,How close are they?
2869286,eng,What's Tom doing in there?
7509166,eng,I know that Tom will like doing that by himself.
39317,eng,But I was always too lazy.
7126709,eng,How much do you think it was?
4025312,eng,Do you know what it means when a man presents a ring to a woman?
680508,eng,Choose a food from each part of the menu.
3907843,eng,Tell them what's on your mind.
6502484,eng,Why didn't you tell me Tom and Mary weren't Canadians?
2543597,eng,I'm glad you suggested this.
240126,eng,Please call me up later.
7205517,eng,I don't think that what Tom did was easy.
2757215,eng,Everything makes sense now.
4529943,eng,Tom was arrested in 2013.
3071336,eng,Will you reserve a room for me for tomorrow?
7253618,eng,Sami was in tears all the time.
279603,eng,Winter is approaching.
2271955,eng,I won't dispute that.
1454177,eng,I can't put up with all that noise.
7377148,eng,Mary said that she'll do that soon.
6211763,eng,"Then, as the end of the enchantment was come, the Princess awoke, and looking on him with eyes more tender than could have been expected at first sight, said:— ""Is it you, my Prince? You have waited a long while."""
7320673,eng,Sami was so fucking sweet.
5607794,eng,I'm getting tired of doing this.
275157,eng,The sun was on the point of rising in the east.
5633167,eng,I don't blame Tom for retiring.
2111416,eng,That's outstanding.
2986024,eng,Tom ran to the door and tried to get out.
7440743,eng,They said that they're bored.
6347543,eng,Tom doesn't have any reason to cry.
7155915,eng,I would like to mention one more thing.
6664558,eng,I loved Tom a lot.
7440476,eng,They said that they're thirsty.
6053670,eng,Layla wasn't rattled by Sami's death in the least.
7676475,eng,Pass me the ball.
6526237,eng,Tom said he didn't know who Mary was planning to go with.
274273,eng,There is frost on the grass.
4848413,eng,She is at home.
7439263,eng,They said they would leave on Monday.
3916672,eng,Has anyone heard from them?
5083110,eng,Tom can't tell the difference between melancholy and depression.
3384302,eng,I am convinced that something is happening between them.
2646128,eng,You were the best one.
2712492,eng,"Even though his mother told him to get ready for dinner, Tom continued playing his game."
3736041,eng,Children often imitate their parents.
3913355,eng,You can't let her suffer.
6235909,eng,"Tom and his friends are outside, waiting for you."
7475302,eng,They say they'll leave on Monday.
30565,eng,The day is breaking soon.
322673,eng,My pulse is slow.
431680,eng,Have you ever been to Kyoto?
5537506,eng,Just sit back and enjoy the show.
6374199,eng,Sami left the house in the middle of the night.
6656508,eng,I'm the one who suggested opening a bottle of wine.
2958120,eng,Tom should be considered dangerous.
2893325,eng,"If I were you, I wouldn't think twice — but thrice."
5733066,eng,I hope this debate isn't over.
239993,eng,Let's drive to the lake.
5073748,eng,They're having a hard time.
2644327,eng,Tom seemed really impressed.
313164,eng,She cleaned her room before her guests arrived.
5850690,eng,I did that just for fun.
3735387,eng,You're the only one I can count on for help.
1094147,eng,Tom explored every possibility.
7436277,eng,Tom and Mary said that they would do what we asked.
5853787,eng,Tom is trying to find his father.
63515,eng,"If he knew the truth, he would tell us."
6354508,eng,Tom hasn't ever done that.
6229812,eng,I think it would be safe for you to do that by yourself.
5830237,eng,How many hours of sleep did you really get last night?
7356059,eng,Powerlifting saved Tom's life.
6503679,eng,I need to make sure that Tom and Mary don't do that.
7736481,eng,How much are you going to be paid?
288352,eng,He made ten blunders in as many lines.
3728531,eng,I can put it back in the drawer if you want.
2311495,eng,Thankfully nothing unfortunate happened.
7476043,eng,They look like they're sleepy.
6655849,eng,Tom is the laziest guy I know.
6890531,eng,Is it next Monday you're going to do that?
7328878,eng,Sami went to his dad.
3123614,eng,What would you like to do in the meantime?
7396325,eng,He knows that he has to buy time.
3431196,eng,Tom is very conscientious.
6270963,eng,I can't dance very well.
7070257,eng,A vicious dog is attacking people all round the countryside.
6251610,eng,Did Tom go to Boston with you?
7117570,eng,I'd like to get this prescription refilled.
5853085,eng,Tom says I'm selfish.
2545424,eng,I'm doing what I have to.
6520418,eng,Tom and Mary said they'd like to help.
6741852,eng,Sami came to Layla's house.
2649021,eng,I was very busy.
6438973,eng,I'd rather do that on Monday.
7150942,eng,Sami gave Layla an opportunity to tell him the truth.
2111672,eng,I'm unarmed.
3818128,eng,It won't be easy to forget you.
2237678,eng,Tom seemed upset.
5151913,eng,Recently I'm ending up feeling like every single thing is a chore.
1204167,eng,I'm looking at my reflection in the lake.
2646334,eng,Tom prepared to leave.
5921262,eng,Sami practised medicine.
6517314,eng,Tom and Mary couldn't do it by themselves.
6474386,eng,"If I'm not given it, I'll earn it."
6688034,eng,Tell Tom what you want him to do.
6357085,eng,Please come tomorrow.
2643857,eng,We meet every Monday night.
2290376,eng,I didn't know where you were.

3737820,eng,Do you really want to go to Boston with me?

6685021,eng,Will this hurt?
6385943,eng,Sami has already talked to Layla.

6234875,eng,I don't think Tom is amused by what's going on.

6430203,eng,Tom wants to throw all of this stuff away.
5055292,eng,The child is in the care of his aunt.
3826744,eng,I was just angry.

3442349,eng,Tom leaned in close for a better look.
7382982,eng,He mostly kept to himself.
7399552,eng,She says she's ready to do that.

49211,eng,The flower is opening.
5254807,eng,They wash lettuce.

70534,eng,I'll give you our answer after we go into your proposal in greater detail.
6565037,eng,You could've told the truth.
1455278,eng,My mother gets up earlier than I do.
2954463,eng,You deserve the best.

491681,eng,What time did he say he'd come?
6243358,eng,Tom's office is very different from mine.
3738247,eng,What was Tom working on?
2275411,eng,Don't you think it's weird?

292970,eng,He reddened like a schoolboy.
6272184,eng,You may come tomorrow.
5736305,eng,We don't want to get burned.
3819689,eng,I knew you wouldn't have enough time.
5825785,eng,Tom looked as if he were ready to cry.
6419236,eng,Mary said she'll go to Boston in October.

6237269,eng,Tom has done almost nothing we asked him to do.
287447,eng,I had to swallow his insult.
6357323,eng,Tom thinks Mary won't likely win.
6518319,eng,Tom and Mary aren't where they should be.
7539483,eng,Tom asked Mary to find out what John wanted us to do.
3725817,eng,I want to prove to you I've learned my lesson.
5956026,eng,When will we have a female president?
5585844,eng,After a quick break and a snack he felt revitalized.
3732562,eng,Tom used the same excuse as you just did.
284227,eng,How about waiting here until he gets back?
6422959,eng,Mary was certainly enjoying herself.
7406754,eng,They say they've had a hard day.
3908099,eng,Tell him I'll do it.
6660624,eng,I don't really have any close friends.
6406426,eng,Mary could be planning to do that by herself.
801136,eng,I feel fortunate to have known you.
3738245,eng,How late was the train?
6530272,eng,Tom has done something very bad.
7070826,eng,He was my math teacher.
6624751,eng,"Those indignant winds grumble with a loud murmuring around the confines of the mountain; Aeolus sits in his high citadel, holding his scepter, and he soothes their spirits and tempers their rages: if he did not do this, they would surely snatch away seas and lands and the deep heaven itself, and sweep them off through the windy sky."
6900185,eng,Tom finally got the courage to propose to his girlfriend.

6474533,eng,Sami told Layla everything about the affair.

7194592,eng,I can't confirm that's the actual number of deaths.
6489814,eng,When do Tom and Mary plan to go?
6231330,eng,"You weren't actually the one who did that, were you?"
7382738,eng,She still lives by herself.
7163317,eng,I thought I'd stay in Australia for a couple of weeks in October.
5850443,eng,I'm too weak to do that.
240842,eng,"As he entered the hall, two men approached him."
7137031,eng,"Sometimes I'm right, sometimes Tom is."

6091119,eng,Tom is a lot better at it than Mary is.
240580,eng,I have a ulcer in my mouth.
68350,eng,"If that boy had not been killed in the traffic accident, he would be a college student now."

2019218,eng,Why did Tom want you to talk to Mary?
7260943,eng,She dreamed of their future together.
324829,eng,"Yoko speaks English, doesn't she?"

1304563,eng,Lisa has a grudge against Stan.
36797,eng,I would not part with it for the whole world.
6996379,eng,"Stand your ground, and words will follow."
6652590,eng,Tom said he thought that Mary needed to do that sometime today.
6815658,eng,I told Tom what had to be done.
2300641,eng,I can carry that.
4546355,eng,I'll be singing a song at Tom and Mary's wedding.

6531850,eng,Does Tom still like jazz?
5784192,eng,Do you really want Tom to help?
6294164,eng,I can't afford to buy a new one.
7375722,eng,"Mary is likely to be home, isn't she?"
7444894,eng,They told me they'd stay home.
6425756,eng,Mary would help us if she could.
3010382,eng,Tom wrote Mary right back.
19329,eng,How about stopping over at Kyoto and sightseeing at the old capital?

1610890,deu,Ungewollt errötete ich.
5843534,deu,Wir waren beide sehr hungrig.
2917235,deu,"Ich möchte, dass wir Freundinnen sind."

3428785,deu,Tom steht des Morgens meist vor Sonnenaufgang auf.
3390582,deu,"Man sagt, dass das malaysische Flugzeug von einem russischen Raketensystem des Typs „Buk“ abgeschossen worden ist. Moskau hat einen absonderlichen Namen für seine todbringende Waffe gefunden. Übersetzt aus der tatarischen Sprache, bedeutet „Buk“ nichts anderes als Scheisse. Wie eine Rakete genannt wird, so wird sie auch fliegen. Und die friedliche „Buche“ ist in diesem Fall ganz unschuldig. Einen Mörder heisst man immer nur Scheisse!"
5645790,deu,Warum habt ihr mir das nicht gesagt?
4140798,deu,Mein Pass ist nicht mehr gültig.
1843955,deu,Haben Sie es fallenlassen?

6466444,deu,"Er schlafwandelt, wenn er viel trinkt."
5324311,deu,Ich hätte es ohne euch nicht gekonnt.
1552726,deu,"Ja, ich spreche es ein bisschen."
1761249,deu,Kannst du mir beim Umzug helfen?

6642606,deu,Tom kam um 2:30 Uhr nach Hause.
6489426,deu,Das große Studiofenster war oben offen und ließ eine angenehme Nordwestbrise herein.

2154957,deu,Der Mensch ist mehr wert als Geld.
3778510,deu,Lässt sich der Termin vorverlegen?

683143,deu,Welche Farbe ziehen Sie vor: Blau oder Grün?
449650,deu,Mein Lieblingssport ist Fußball.
372763,deu,Ich setze mich morgen mit Dir in Verbindung und lege die Uhrzeit fest.
351702,deu,Er wohnt einen Stock über mir.
4886966,deu,Ist sie verrückt geworden?
667277,deu,Wie hat der Film dir gefallen?
7485766,deu,Gebt mir drei Wochen.
5304717,deu,Siehst du das große Buch?
6617919,deu,Seid ihr mutig?
1650997,deu,Eine unerklärliche Unruhe machte sich unter den Gästen breit.

3551370,deu,"Die Entscheidung, für die Briten zu kämpfen, erwies sich als Fehler."
7478101,deu,"Maria sagte Tom, dass sie glaube, dass es Johannes gutgehe."
7330891,deu,Was hat Tom letzten Monat in Australien gemacht?
5983139,deu,Dieses Eichhörnchen hält Winterschlaf.
1422218,deu,Mein Vater wohnt in einem besetzen Haus.
5419123,deu,Die dortige Landschaft ist durch Alleen geprägt.
2744496,deu,Karriere ist die Beförderung bis zur absoluten Inkompetenz.
1202550,deu,Du riechst nach Kacke.

1726938,deu,Er baut nur Luftschlösser.
3107725,deu,Welche Art von Büchern lesen Sie am liebsten?
1919395,deu,Nur ich kann so geduldig mit dir sein.
5654512,deu,"Ein Weg braucht kein Wohin, es genügt ein Woher."
4299838,deu,Das ist ein Hammer!

2241379,deu,Ich habe letzte Woche eine interessante Schachpartie gegen den Computer gespielt.
1947277,deu,Der Mann raubte alles Geld von Susan.
5192423,deu,"Das Geschäft war dermaßen voll, dass sie einander aus den Augen verloren."
6639516,deu,"Tom, du Schafskopf! Was hast du hier wieder angestellt!"
3518889,deu,Tom sah auf den Tachometer.
1907224,deu,"Es ist nicht so billig, dass ich es mir kaufen könnte."
2460159,deu,Etwas Derartiges hatte er vor Augen.
2027718,deu,"Es ist mir gleich, was passiert."
3968635,deu,Seine Anstrengungen waren vergebens.
3546574,deu,"Die Arbeitsaufgabe besteht hauptsächlich darin, Unterholz zu entfernen und Abfall wegzuräumen."
1530976,deu,Tom ging mit Mary ins Theater.
1551825,deu,"Natürlich gibt es keine vernünftige Gesellschaft. Aber es gibt immer eine, die vernünftiger ist als die bestehende."
1238357,deu,Esperanto ist dufte!

6172155,deu,"Ich bin froh, endlich zu Hause zu sein."
4821185,deu,"Wenn ich mich auf das, was eine Person sagt, konzentrieren will, schaue ich auf ihre Lippen."
5502200,deu,"Damit 100 ihren Körper bilden, müssen 50 Sport treiben. Und damit 50 Sport treiben, müssen sich 20 spezialisieren. Damit sich aber 20 spezialisieren, müssen fünf zu überragenden Gipfelleistungen fähig sein."
5085817,deu,Wiederholst du das bitte?
2652783,deu,Alles sah hell und hoffnungsvoll aus.
7205060,deu,„Wo sollen wir uns hinsetzen?“ – „Aufs Hinterteil!“
7636649,deu,Tom hat sich vernünftig benommen.
6778967,deu,"Die Gewalt einer Sprache ist nicht, dass sie das Fremde abweist, sondern dass sie es verschlingt."
5331140,deu,Anna kann keine Arbeit finden.

4699805,deu,Gott segne Euch!
5102301,deu,Ich habe weitergemacht.
5657153,deu,"Verschwinde, du Idiot!"
919497,deu,Er hat es mit eigenen Augen gesehen.
1585392,deu,Termiten zerstören die Häuser.
7060551,deu,Das Gute wird letzten Endes das Böse besiegen.
1422612,deu,"Das ist schwer zu sagen, weil das Gesetz keine Definition beinhaltet."
3964285,deu,Es haben sechzig neue Museen geöffnet.
4806349,deu,Schrei nicht.
1699372,deu,Die Geschwister Scholl gehörten zur Weißen Rose.
3218448,deu,"Wie oft habe ich dir schon gesagt, dass du deine Wäsche zusammenlegen sollst?"
3480705,deu,In diesem Augenblick flüsterte jemand ein Zauberwort und veränderte mein Leben.
7683968,deu,"Ich will nicht zynisch sein, aber was glaubst du, wer du bist?"
6935794,deu,"Lass dieser Bäume hochgewölbtes Dach, zum Augenblick des Rastens, freundlich schatten."
942328,deu,Der Bahnhof ist ganz in der Nähe. Sie werden den Zug noch erwischen.
7728834,deu,Ich bin ehrgeizig.
1012404,deu,Nach dem Weltkrieg stand hier kein Stein mehr auf dem anderen.
2469544,deu,"Lassen Sie mich Ihnen erklären, was ich von all dem denke."
1276574,deu,In der Jägersprache wird der Kot des Wildes als Losung bezeichnet.
1699542,deu,Sie begann zu weinen.
3277855,deu,"Das ist ein schlechter Handel, wenn niemand gewinnt!"
1732430,deu,Er konnte wegen des starken Regens nicht ausgehen.
1758444,deu,"Müssen sie etwa jetzt danach trachten, die gute Zusammenarbeit zunichte zu machen, die wir gerade in Europa aufzubauen versuchen?"
4182390,deu,"Ich beginne wirklich, beunruhigt zu sein."
5023564,deu,Das Spiel ist noch nicht zu Ende.
1834895,deu,Sie gab sich den Anschein der Unschuld.
6608791,deu,"Als Tom wieder an seinem Wagen war, klemmte ein Strafzettel unter dem Scheibenwischer."
920822,deu,Wir sprechen Japanisch.
5841273,deu,"So etwas wie einen Geist, mein Herr, gibt es nicht."
7636784,deu,Tom hat etwas Geld auf der Bank.
1401471,deu,Ich habe es dem kleinen Jungen gegeben.
5170941,deu,Du nervtest deine Schwester.
7431062,deu,Tom hat Australien Anfang Oktober verlassen.
5915145,deu,Sie haben richtig gewählt.
1644819,deu,Mein Vater las mir vor dem Einschlafen immer etwas vor.
7122516,deu,Wir haben am Freitag vom Sommer Abschied genommen.
5234980,deu,"Die Welt ist eine Blüte, rieche daran und reiche sie deinen Freunden weiter."

3701565,deu,Lange bemüht sich der Mensch.
6174101,deu,"Ich war irgendwie überrascht, dass Tom das sagte."
5848812,deu,"Ich dachte, ich könnte mich auf dich verlassen."
3687011,deu,"Der Lehrer züchtigte die Kinder, wenn sie sich nicht benahmen oder außerstande waren, ihr Einmaleins aufzusagen."
2196560,deu,"Es wurde gesagt, ein so dreckiges Haus hätte man bislang noch nicht gesehen."
705754,deu,Ist das Frühstück inbegriffen?
423832,deu,Er hat versehentlich den falschen Zug genommen.
2711819,deu,Ich habe viel von Ihnen gelernt.
6372534,deu,"Ich hätte gerne gewusst, warum die Leute mich anstarrten."
3266459,deu,Mary dankte mir mit einem Lächeln.
1982916,deu,Die Hunde waren fröhlich.
5226088,deu,"Es wäre besser, du würdest damit aufhören, die Leute zu beobachten, wie sie Handys benutzen."
1071217,deu,Er geht oft mit ihr ins Kino.
1045524,deu,Wir haben eine weiße Katze.
683157,deu,"Haben Sie gehört, ob Tom die Stelle bekommen hat?"
4796830,deu,Das ist ein gefragter Artikel.

785265,deu,Er kann den Rest der Familie imitieren.

2858948,deu,Schaut euch dieses Bild gut an!
7328660,deu,"Der 20. Oktober war der Tag, an dem Tom sein Hund Bello zulief."
1233310,deu,Sie wickelte sich in die Decke.
1399367,deu,Er hat uns über den Tisch gezogen.
7302823,deu,"Tom kann Text lesen, der auf dem Kopf steht."
742234,deu,Du solltest diesen Vertrag wirklich schriftlich festhalten.
3017513,deu,Mach die verdammte Tür zu!
4846858,deu,"Das Leben will gelebt werden — das ist alles, was es zu tun gibt."
719146,deu,Die Popularität einer Webseite hängt von ihrem Inhalt ab.
3471975,deu,Der Google-Übersetzer kann Ihnen helfen.
2972301,deu,Das mag ich an euch.
7335000,deu,"Maria hofft, dass Tom mit ihr zu Mittag isst."
6763144,deu,"Pah, diese Leute interessieren mich nicht!"
3046052,deu,"Es tut mir sehr leid zu erfahren, dass Ihr Vater verstorben ist."
938673,deu,Sei mein Gast!
5164615,deu,"Ich habe ihr erzählt, dass ich einen Fehler gemacht habe."

1927265,deu,Tom hat sich jetzt selbst verwirrt!
139104,deu,Dieses Haus gehört Herrn Yamada.
971123,deu,Wo wart ihr gestern?
1948427,deu,Mehr hatte Tom nicht zu sagen.
3084221,deu,Er kommt in der Regel rechtzeitig.
3754703,deu,Ich bin froh darüber.
2715444,deu,"Ich passe auf dein Kätzchen auf, solange du weg bist."

2590619,deu,Er sah dies nicht das erste Mal.
660611,deu,Er konnte wegen seiner Krankheit nicht kommen.
4850293,deu,"Sie war das schönste Mädchen, das er je gesehen hatte."

1324644,deu,"Ich habe noch nicht entschieden, was ich machen werde."
1318487,deu,"Die logistische Herausforderung ist augenscheinlich; kommen doch die Wahlurnen aus Deutschland, die Wahlkabinen aus dem Libanon, die Stimmzettel aus Südafrika und weitere Ausrüstungen sogar aus China."
3156725,deu,"Je mehr ich versuche, ihn zu vergessen, desto mehr denke ich an meinen Exfreund."

5336507,deu,"Es ist nicht erlaubt, ohne Genehmigung im Theater zu fotografieren."
5453903,deu,"Ich bin sicher, dass sie schon einen diabolischen Plan ausgeheckt haben werden."
1693136,deu,Tom sucht einen Arbeitsplatz.

2366471,deu,"Du hörst nicht auf Fortschritte zu machen, ich bin sehr stolz auf dich."
6091078,deu,"Sie trinken nur deshalb Alkohol, um sich die Hucke voll zu saufen."

1729838,deu,Sie kam vom Regen in die Traufe.
3781552,deu,Das macht dann 3000¥.
639752,deu,Seine Frau ist eine Freundin von mir.
3623151,deu,Tom sang besser als Miri.
3344609,deu,Tom brachte Maria zum Weinen.
3842034,deu,"Ich habe viele Fehler in diesem Leben gemacht, aber ich habe so viel durch sie gelernt, dass ich sogar denke, noch einige mehr zu machen."
3402976,deu,"Tom verzehrt sich danach, dich zu sehen."
424740,deu,"Du willst einen französischen Film anschauen, oder?"
785512,deu,"Nach dem Himmel zu urteilen, könnten wir morgen Schnee haben."
3177754,deu,Es steht einer an der Haustür.
6700340,deu,Die Vergangenheit dieses Mannes ist außergewöhnlich.
1397469,deu,"Der Pessimist entdeckt an jeder Chance die Schwierigkeiten, der Optimist an jeder Schwierigkeit die Chancen."
1755677,deu,Er jagte die Dokumente durch den Reißwolf.
547227,deu,Der Baum wurde mit einem kräftigen Schlag seiner Axt gefällt.
7295216,deu,Ich habe Tom etwas vorenthalten.
814337,deu,Ich bin ziemlich froh.
6644503,deu,"Ich denke, Tom macht das vielleicht."
2300361,deu,Er kann das Klavier nicht alleine tragen.
3788252,deu,Tom könnte dafür ins Gefängnis kommen.
1239165,deu,"Ich hatte nicht lange gewartet, da tauchte er auch schon auf."
2205599,deu,Wir sind nicht versichert.
1385570,deu,"Das ist ein Berggipfel, auf den Sie nur in Begleitung eines erfahrenen ortsansässigen Führers steigen können."
2909037,deu,Kann mich jemand hören?
1207883,deu,"Es ist lange her, dass ich Libellen in diesem Gebiet gesehen habe."
6363428,deu,Er weiß nichts mit sich anzufangen.
3971932,deu,Tom ist sehr charmant.
2221603,deu,"Wir sahen, wie ein altes Haus abgerissen wurde."
2011256,deu,Tom hat seinen Lebenswillen verloren.
2215428,deu,Er rettete uns alle.
4045900,deu,Ihre Sachen sind alle hier.
4548183,deu,Das ist erforderlich.
1940939,deu,Tom wird wahrscheinlich vor halb drei ankommen.
2629539,deu,Ich würde mir ihre Sammlung sehr gern einmal ansehen.
473937,deu,"Menschen, die Latein nicht für die schönste Sprache halten, verstehen nichts."
4913263,deu,Man soll sein eigenes Leben nicht ernster nehmen als ein Stück von Shakespeare! Aber auch nicht minder ernst!
1952501,deu,Ich kann Tom nicht einfach ignorieren.
5931887,deu,Sie sprechen mit ihren Kindern nur Finnisch.
6624787,deu,Wird das in Ordnung sein?
640574,deu,"Die Mathehausaufgaben waren leichter, als ich erwartet hatte."
3613306,deu,"Wie wäre es, wenn du schon schlafen gingest? Du musst morgen früh raus."
7481980,deu,Gebt mir das zurück.
2477206,deu,Ein Maitag ist ein kategorischer Imperativ der Freude.
2160157,deu,"Ich dachte, ihr wüsstet vielleicht, wo Tom hingegangen ist."
3034245,deu,"Tom hätte Mary einladen müssen, hat es aber nicht getan."
1913286,deu,Wenn ich nur nicht so in Eile gewesen wäre!
3034431,deu,Es könnte ein großes Problem sein.
7162224,deu,Ich muss eine Wand abreißen.
4919389,deu,Höre auf uns zu foltern.
7697195,deu,Maria hat es erklärt.
619560,deu,Ich spreche mit dem Direktor.
1152272,deu,Dies ist Tonis Buch.
2414343,deu,"Solange unsere Sicherheit kein Kind der Vernunft sein kann, muss sie eine Tochter des Schreckens sein."
6122289,deu,Mein Chef ist ein Schuft.
3945681,deu,Meine Familie wird dich lieben.
6772528,deu,Wir können einen Spaziergang machen.
1950048,deu,Wann kommt die Flut?
4018915,deu,Tom hat dich wahrscheinlich schon vergessen.
7331214,deu,Tom malte zumeist religiöse Szenen.
823353,deu,Habt ihr Vierteldollarmünzen?
6741785,deu,Der Zug fährt sofort ab.
2672058,deu,"Ich bin auch dafür; somit steht es drei gegen einen, und du bist mit deinem Einspruch überstimmt."
3037862,deu,"Heutzutage ist es für einen Ehemann höchst gefährlich, seiner Frau in der Öffentlichkeit zu viel Aufmerksamkeit zu schenken. Es führt dazu, dass die Leute glauben, er schlägt sie zu Hause."
584163,deu,Sein Vater ist vor 10 Jahren gestorben.
7057372,deu,Wann wirst du dich zur Ruhe setzen?
2301760,deu,Sie wohnten in einem Fünfsternehotel.
2281921,deu,Tom ist stur.
835714,deu,"Mein liebes Kind, bleib hier unten stehen, die bösen Gänse beißen dich tot."
4420572,deu,„Wie konnte mir nur so ein Anfängerfehler unterlaufen?“ – „Mach dir nichts draus. Das passiert uns allen mal.“
2146706,deu,"Obwohl es regnete, hatten alle ihren Spaß."
1919584,deu,Ich kann nicht kommen. Meine Verwandten besuchen mich an diesem Tag.
2335860,deu,Im Hof herrscht jetzt vollkommene Dunkelheit.
2357074,deu,"Denn das ist Humor: Durch die Dinge durchsehen, wie wenn sie aus Glas wären."
1577999,deu,"Menschen sind wie Kirchenfenster. Wenn die Sonne scheint, strahlen sie in allen Farben, aber wenn die Nacht kommt, kann nur ein Licht im Innern sie voll zur Geltung bringen."
2080783,deu,Dein Aufsatz ist bis jetzt der beste.
401643,deu,"Heute Nachmittag gibt es viele Dinge, die ich zu erledigen habe."
7464008,deu,Du hast meinen Glauben an die Menschheit wiederhergestellt.
1929242,deu,Beim Hobeln fallen Späne.
1568337,deu,Er ist ein berühmter J-pop Sänger.
1058766,deu,Der Mensch kann nicht gleichzeitig Gott und dem Mammon dienen. Die glückliche Ausnahme ist der Pfarrer.
5295718,deu,Dieser Ort wurde im Krieg bombardiert.
2995030,deu,"Du musst aufpassen, dass du niemandem in die Quere kommst."
1937309,deu,Er schnitt die Nase ab.
1080700,deu,"Ein Gefühl der Erleichterung machte sich in ihm breit, als er sah, dass sie lebte."
3099402,deu,Hätte ich doch nur zehn Augen! Dann könnte ich fünf Bücher gleichzeitig lesen!
1810119,deu,Das war nur eine zufällige Nachlässigkeit von ihm.
2756058,deu,"Die neue Prüfungsordnung unserer Universität sieht vor, dass Antworten, die nicht auf Englisch gegeben werden, bei der Bewertung keine Berücksichtigung finden sollen."
754325,deu,"Weißt du, welche Straße zu meinem Haus führt?"
6712456,deu,"Maria scheint zu wissen, wovon sie spricht."
605438,deu,Wir verwirrten ihn zusammen mit einem Amerikaner.
1941136,deu,"Tom ist jemand, auf den man sich verlassen kann."
1798480,deu,Ein Königreich für eine Cola!
6817152,deu,Hansens haben uns für heute zum Abendessen eingeladen.
6766102,deu,Toms Musik ist wundervoll.
2750396,deu,"Willst du wissen, was Tom zugestoßen ist?"
5867507,deu,"Tom sagt, er könne das ändern."
7005279,deu,Ich mache mir Vorwürfe. Ich habe ein schlechtes Gewissen.
2708510,deu,Warte sechs Stunden!
6469951,deu,Tom ist sehr reserviert.
1463474,deu,"Ich bin es müde, mir die Klagen meiner Frau anzuhören. Sie scheinen endlos zu sein."
7684117,deu,Ich traue mich nicht drüber.
427521,deu,"Wenn Sie sich einem Kamel nähern, riskieren Sie, gebissen zu werden."
3090654,deu,Tom hat mir die Nase gebrochen.
273,deu,Ausländer machen mich neugierig.
4439140,deu,"Zuallererst möchte ich ausdrücken, wie dankbar ich bin. Danke!"
1014698,deu,Ich habe euch nicht gehört.
5280883,deu,Die nächste Haltestelle ist Aquincum.
2655201,deu,Gute Gedanken tragen gute Früchte; schlechte Gedanken tragen schlechte Früchte.
1920906,deu,Frauen Lügen nicht. Sie erfinden die Wahrheit einfach neu!
5155847,deu,"Ich wurde sehr nervös, als ich meinen Reisepass nicht finden konnte."
5583254,deu,Warum hast du deinen Eltern nichts gesagt?
7057304,deu,Maria macht es nicht für Geld und gute Worte.
6641580,deu,Was sieht Tom in dir?
2054231,deu,Doch zumindest bin ich im Herzen gelassen.
3786616,deu,Warum hältst du ständig zu Tom?
924877,deu,Sie betete für die Rückkehr ihres Sohnes.
2969804,deu,"Ich würde dir helfen, wenn du in Schwierigkeiten wärst."
3101597,deu,Tom hatte schon viele Freundinnen.
1964093,deu,Berichte mir von deinem Schiff!
6540704,deu,"Maria hoffte, dass Toms Befinden ihm ein Kommen ermöglichen würde."
666032,deu,"Wenn Du es nicht getan hättest, hätte es irgendein anderer getan."
1306163,deu,Er steckte sein Geld in die Tasche.
1448519,deu,Es waren zweihundert Leute in dem Raum.
4921576,deu,"Wir beschlossen, sie ins Meer zu werfen."
4007337,deu,Endlich rief die Sprechstundenhilfe Tom auf.
5855867,deu,Wir haben John zu unserem Anführer gewählt.
3589000,deu,Ich habe einen Monster unter dem Bett lebend.
1683972,deu,Unterschätze seine Entschlossenheit nicht.
2671551,deu,"Tom ging zurück, die Treppe hinunter."
714057,deu,Die Materie ist ein Epiphänomen des Geistes.
555904,deu,Stell nur Ja- oder Nein-Fragen.
1888782,deu,"Es versteht sich von selbst, dass Haustiere nicht erlaubt sind."
1872102,deu,Weshalb kommst du zu spät?
5954372,deu,Die Nacht fördert den Schlaf.
6826728,deu,"Tom versprach mir, dass er das täte, bevor er nach Hause ginge."
2746359,deu,"Tom weiß noch nicht einmal, wie man einen Ball dribbelt."
729840,deu,Kraut kann man roh essen.
2293368,deu,"Es sieht so aus, als hätte Gott beschlossen, Grimes zu essen, dann festgestellt, dass er nicht gut schmeckte und ihn wieder ausgespuckt."
1281752,deu,"Welchen Sinn hat es, jetzt aufzugeben?"
6305303,deu,Ich machte Maria zu meiner Sekretärin.
990179,deu,Aus seinen Worten spricht der Neid.
2686823,deu,Diese Schachtel ist dreimal so groß wie jene.
3669290,deu,Wo hast du deinen Freund kennengelernt?
345462,deu,Sprich bitte ein bisschen langsamer.
412208,deu,"Ich kenne die Frau nicht, die mit unserem Lehrer spricht."
3403744,deu,"Ihr erkennt mich nicht, oder?"
2617516,deu,Dieser Pfahl hat eine scharfe Spitze.
6560000,deu,Es weihnachtet schon!
1895399,deu,"Wenn man Ihre Nummer anruft, meldet sich niemand."
1833185,deu,Ihr habt zwei ältere Brüder.
4933373,deu,Konnten Sie gestern gut schlafen?
786576,deu,Wir sind für heute mit der Arbeit fertig.
5319047,deu,"Es scheint, sie hat gelogen."
2994756,deu,Heute Nacht komme ich wieder.
2477999,deu,"Dass das so ist, finde ich gut."
1562611,deu,Er widmet sich der Forschung.
4977210,deu,"Wenn wir keinen Feind in uns tragen, dann kann uns der Feind draußen nichts anhaben."
819397,deu,"Mein Platz ist am Fenster, oder?"
2478804,deu,Ich habe sonst nichts.
2433835,deu,Tom brauchte sich nicht zu beeilen. Er hatte noch alle Zeit der Welt.
3077635,deu,Sie rief den Psychiater an.
1274894,deu,"Es geht mir auf die Nerven, wenn du in meiner Wohnung rauchst."
1268485,deu,Ich brauche deine Mitarbeit.
1276583,deu,"Entscheidend ist die Antwort auf die Frage, wer als Erster geschossen hat."
943933,deu,"Wir suchen jemanden, der gut in Französisch ist."
2781204,deu,Ein Fieberwahn hat ihn befallen.
541833,deu,"Wenn ich nicht einen Schluck Wasser trinke, kann ich diese Tablette nicht hinunterschlucken."
4181525,deu,Wo hast du meine Zigaretten versteckt?
2510531,deu,Bar oder Kreditkarte?
2351730,deu,Wir müssen die Polizei benachrichtigen.
5579615,deu,Er ist kurzum ein Mann von großem Können.
4454548,deu,Brot mit Butter schmeckt sehr gut.
3655492,deu,"Tom sagte, dass er Lust hätte, seinen Job zu schmeißen und rund um Australien zu trampen."
797948,deu,Sollen wir zur Abwechslung mal essen gehen?
6645349,deu,Diese sind zu groß.
804,deu,"Obwohl er seine Haftstrafe im Gefängnis abgesessen hatte, verzieh die Öffentlichkeit dem Mörder sein Verbrechen nie ganz."
2427931,deu,Er will im Krankenhaus arbeiten.
6937976,deu,Tiere können nicht sprechen.
3765636,deu,"Das junge Entlein kann schwimmen, hat diese Fähigkeit aber noch nicht unter Beweis gestellt."
1618206,deu,"O blühender Raps! Der Mond, er steht im Osten, die Sonn’ im Westen."
7293505,deu,Warum sind Sie so höflich zu mir?
1470797,deu,Jeder übermütige Sieger arbeitet an seinem Untergang.
2837956,deu,Meine Mutter hat mir einen Pullover gestrickt.
6790481,deu,"Maria war in Sorge, sich möglicherweise zu verspäten."
1413893,deu,"Die Mutter betrachtete den schlafenden Wolf von allen Seiten und sah, dass sich etwas in seinem Bauch bewegte."
1841945,deu,Hast du das auch gehört?
5660228,deu,Wie findest du das?
1103268,deu,Ken hat sich wohl schwer erkältet.
4260020,deu,Das Kind stellt Erwachsene in den Schatten.
5968465,deu,Warum rostet Eisen?
6331240,deu,"Sagen Sie mir, was Sie essen, und ich sage Ihnen, was Sie sind."
1717130,deu,Haben Sie schon von ihr gehört?
7050109,deu,Was hast du heute Neues gelernt?
3322945,deu,Hast du dieses Essen wirklich gestohlen?
5207946,deu,Der Anfang ist die Hälfte des Weges.
1139043,deu,Ich habe mich in dem Irrgarten verlaufen.
2057118,deu,"Vergessen wir jedoch nicht, dass diese Zahlen nur die gemeldeten Gewaltakte berücksichtigen!"
4051520,deu,Tom hätte zu Hause bleiben sollen.
3588901,deu,Die CD kostet zehn Dollar.
1315673,deu,"Tun Sie, was auch immer Sie wollen."
2062264,deu,Keiner sollte die Höflichkeit vergessen.
788456,deu,Die Schüler waren alle dort.
7636586,deu,Tom hörte mit dem Rauchen auf.
5694102,deu,Tom hat den ganzen Tag noch nichts gegessen.
1117181,deu,"Wer vom Ziel nichts weiß, wird den Weg nicht finden."
3135118,deu,Wir hätten nicht so früh aufstehen sollen.
3442540,deu,Tom war unfreundlich zu Maria.
238,deu,Ich bin neugierig.
2095181,deu,"Ich bezweifle, dass man unter allen Menschen auch nur einen finden kann, der völlig frei von irgendeiner Form von Wahnsinn ist. Der einzige Unterschied ist das Ausmaß."
1470879,deu,"Du bist der Herr deiner Worte, aber einmal ausgesprochen, beherrschen sie dich."
3760577,deu,Möwen haben kräftige und ziemlich lange Schnäbel.
1485810,deu,"Tom wollte, dass Mary glücklich ist."
6542854,deu,"Ich möchte, dass du mit Tom gehst."
1872927,deu,"Tom versuchte, Marias Namensschild zu lesen."
740901,deu,Was hat sie heute getan?
2789952,deu,"Tom fing an, das Geschirr abzuspülen."
731457,deu,"Zu Weihnachten gibt es Gänsebraten, Rotkraut und Klöße."
2664942,deu,"Mama, Tom hat meinen Keks aufgegessen!"
229,deu,"Nein, er ist nicht mein neuer Freund."
6381752,deu,Schließe beim Hinausgehen die Tür!
2552894,deu,"Wer die Wahrheit liebt, will sie sehen. Wer sie fürchtet, hat sie gesehen."
2366876,deu,Im galaktischen Zentrum befindet sich das nächste uns bekannte supermassive Schwarze Loch.
444872,deu,Sein Leben ist voller Probleme.
5943617,deu,Tom erwarb im Handel einen kleinen antiken Teppich.
6878071,deu,Darf ich mich mal umsehen?
3502607,deu,Die Regierung hat einen beispiellosen Propagandafeldzug organisiert.
7726735,deu,Hat dieses Stück keine Nummer?
1708081,deu,Ich fühlte mich deplatziert.
2748575,deu,Isaac Newton starb als Jungfrau.
5351363,deu,"Ich dachte, Tom wäre nach Harvard gegangen."
759610,deu,"Das Problem ist, ich kann mich nicht erinnern, wo ich mein Auto geparkt habe."
6028433,deu,"Ich mag keine Autos, deshalb fahre ich immer Fahrrad."
2223598,deu,Was verlangst du hierfür?
2810547,deu,Ich bin kein schlechter Mensch.
7664387,deu,"Jeder hat die Macht, seine Privilegien zu missbrauchen."
1229820,deu,"Wer bist du und warum weckst du mich? - fragte ich, noch benommen vom Schlaf. - ""Ich bin dein Gewissen und das Warum kannst du erraten."" - sagte der Wecker mit einem provokanten Ton in seiner metallischen Stimme."
601800,deu,Führen Sie den Herrn zum Ausgang!
444992,deu,Ich fragte ihn nach seinem Namen.
1894388,deu,"Der großgewachsene Mann lächelte, als er Tom sah."
2668472,deu,Er ist kein Adler.
1810615,deu,"Sie wollen nicht, dass du es weißt."
1238348,deu,Sie hat die Hosen an.
1944064,deu,Es ist kein Verbrechen zu tanzen.
665069,deu,Im Winter haben wir viel Schnee.
485973,deu,Angewidert starrte ich auf den blutroten Brief. Ob das wohl der berüchtigte auf rotem Papier gedruckte Einberufungsbefehl ist?
1849978,deu,Er widmete sein Leben der medizinischen Arbeit.
5285883,deu,"Sie spricht zwar Spanisch, ihr Englisch ist aber bei weitem besser."
836077,deu,"Beeilt euch, oder ihr verpasst den Zug."
5601170,deu,Sie haben einander ergänzt.
6392629,deu,Große Künstler haben kein Heimatland.
2628022,deu,Das Leben besteht aus Begegnungen und Trennungen.
913841,deu,Stellt doch nicht so schwere Fragen!
1392673,deu,Bitte setzt euch!
1521334,deu,Dieser Mensch ist gestorben.
718114,deu,"Er hat endlich seinen Plan umgesetzt, nach Thailand zu gehen."
6645614,deu,"Das ist dort, wo Tom ist."
6306533,deu,"Tom wusste nicht mehr, wie es weitergehen sollte. Also schrieb er eines Tages einen Abschiedsbrief, setzte sich ins Auto und fuhr davon. Das Auto wurde später an einem Waldrand gefunden, aber Tom – oder die Reste seiner Leiche – sind bis heute verschollen."
7451710,deu,Ich werde das nicht unterschreiben.
1527434,deu,Dem Spiel fehlte es an Spannung.
6943327,deu,"Wer hat mein Lied so zerstört, Mama?"
2179823,deu,Das Wasser war anderthalb Meter tief.
7546998,deu,Friedrich III. war nur 99 Tage Deutscher Kaiser. Er starb infolge starken Rauchens an Kehlkopfkrebs. So hat der Tabak die deutsche Geschichte beeinflusst.
6872093,deu,Ich hätte niemals mit ihm reden sollen.
3070098,deu,Er hat schon viel fremdes Brot gegessen.
660454,deu,Der Käsekuchen schmeckte zu süß.
1792978,deu,Tom und Maria sind schon seit drei Jahren verheiratet.
1735223,deu,Endlich schlief der Säugling ein.
3455839,deu,"Ich weiß, ich bin kein symphatischer Typ."
3854704,deu,Du wirst abwarten müssen.
1347086,deu,Es vergingen zwei Monate seit meiner Ankunft in Tokyo.
1708114,deu,Was immer er auch sagen mag — bleibe gelassen!
413898,deu,Hast du was zum Lesen?
1944971,deu,Gelindes Feuer gibt süßes Malz.
6574789,deu,"Du wirst viel lernen müssen, wenn du die Prüfung bestehen willst."
3939918,deu,Tom hat das Thema gewechselt.
2753636,deu,"Man muss die Fehler, die man nicht ablegen kann, in Tugenden verwandeln."
1853985,deu,"Versuche nicht, mich aufzuhalten!"
5096765,deu,Wir fürchten niemanden.
923534,deu,Fass meine Spaghettibrücke nicht an! Der Kleber härtet noch aus.
2227937,deu,"Du weißt, dass das unsere Pflicht ist."
666026,deu,Ohne dich bin ich traurig.
4817787,deu,"Treibt dich Geldgier in die Ehe, ist die Freiheit bald perdu."
6061451,deu,Tom wurde wegen Überarbeitung depressiv.
7196133,deu,Wer ist hinter Ihnen her?
3231964,deu,Tom hat den Unfall relativ unbeschadet überstanden.
5625013,deu,Er schreibt.
341711,deu,Du darfst nicht zu viel Eis und Spaghetti essen.
7260756,deu,Tom nippte schweigend an seinem Tee.
620327,deu,Er ist immer sehr beschäftigt.
5260514,deu,Wir müssen noch woanders hin.
3033497,deu,Wie hast du dir wehgetan?
1863577,deu,"Ich bin mir nicht sicher, ob ich gehe."
2932414,deu,Ich helfe Tom fast jeden Tag.
1684162,deu,"Es wäre nie wieder so, wie es war."
368619,deu,Du brauchst nicht so kleinlich zu sein.
2674414,deu,"Stell sicher, dass die Leser diejenigen Informationen erhalten, die sie benötigen!"
1359886,deu,Ken konnte sich nicht mehr an seinen Namen erinnern.
1843965,deu,Ich habe es nicht kaputtgemacht.
3463468,deu,Ich war nicht allzu müde.
4967334,deu,Gottes Haustür ist immer offen.
4394364,deu,Das Thema meines Vortrages sind Erfahrungen mit einer zweisprachigen Erziehung in der Familie.
3503988,deu,Diese Häuser haben einen geringen Wärmebedarf.
4020165,deu,"Tom ist derjenige, der mir deine Telefonnummer gegeben hat."
1020931,deu,Ich kann dich nicht genug loben.
1929005,deu,"Ich bin heute nicht als Elternteil wegen meines Sohnes, sondern in meiner Funktion als Notar hier."
3570148,deu,Wie konntest du so etwas sagen?
685024,deu,Die Nummer des vorherigen Schreibtisches ist die 1.
1585634,deu,Sie müssen Ihre Rolle akzeptieren.
2137289,deu,Er war steinhart.
5221151,deu,Tu Gutes: Dein Nachbar erfährt es nie. Tu Böses: Man weiß es auf hundert Meilen.
7645325,deu,Du bist witzig.
5350661,deu,Wann bist du nach Hause gegangen?
5968505,deu,Sie geht in unsere Schule.
3432548,deu,Die Prinzessin bettelte beim Herrscher um Vergebung.
1188654,deu,Sie waren zufrieden.
5755082,deu,Hat sie sonst einer gesehen?
3321569,deu,Ich bin ziemlich neugierig.
744328,deu,Sein Haus wurde niedergebrannt.
1649716,deu,"In der zweiten Monatshälfte werden wir meist warmes und trockenes Wetter haben, das in unserer Region für diese Zeit des Jahres typisch ist."
783675,deu,"Das Theaterstück kenne ich nicht, aber ich kenne den Verfasser gut."
4384711,deu,"Tom ist nicht nur auf Arbeit unglücklich, sondern auch Zuhause."
7635745,deu,Tom war immer anders.
5455483,deu,"Mit siebzig Jahren prahlt man auch dann nicht mehr mit seiner Gesundheit, wenn man etwa noch gut stehen und laufen kann."
978288,deu,Vier Menschen starben am Wochenende.
938628,deu,"Meg brennt darauf, alles über Japan zu erfahren."
1588181,deu,In dieser Woche war es besonders schlimm. Der Zug verspätete sich an zwei Tagen hintereinander.
3701481,deu,"Er ist ein zu großer Feigling, um es zu versuchen."
3754694,deu,Tom gefiel das nicht.
3243273,deu,Die Vase steht auf dem Tisch.
2726959,deu,"Sag Tom aber nicht, dass ich dich geschickt habe!"
1562632,deu,Sie sind verrückt nach Jazz.
2233373,deu,Wozu Socken? Sie schaffen nur Löcher!
714675,deu,Kaufen Sie bitte eine Tube Zahnpasta!
7022724,deu,Bitte urteile nicht über mich!
353686,deu,Lange Haare sind unmodern.
360896,deu,Ich habe dieses Restaurant zufällig gefunden.
3663209,deu,Das Auto steht heute nicht zur Verfügung.
673668,deu,Sollte ich diesen Brief beantworten?
2997789,deu,Er macht sich überhaupt nichts aus mir.
4329700,deu,Ich sah heute Morgen ein Vögelchen.

6601269,deu,"Du kennst mich gut genug, um zu wissen, dass ich so etwas nicht täte."
4194538,deu,"Er ist Meister, wenn sie nicht daheim ist."
1717906,deu,Er kann heute kommen.
799806,deu,"Das ist genau das Video, das ich sehen wollte."
6561960,deu,Der bestellte Artikel wird Ihnen per Post zugestellt.
7062129,deu,Maria will Volk und Land kennenlernen.
5436916,deu,Um halb drei bin ich soweit.
6643361,deu,Keiner liebt dich.
2381385,deu,Hat Tom euch irgend etwas gegeben?
1924583,deu,"Wenn es nicht bald regnet, wird unser Garten austrocknen."
633517,deu,"Freunde kannst du viele haben, bis du vorhast, bei ihnen zu wohnen."
2837293,deu,"Dieser Brief ist zu lang, um ihn für einen vernünftigen Preis übersetzt zu bekommen."
4926485,deu,"Du sagtest doch, du kennest Tom nicht."
4974848,deu,Ist das ungewöhnlich?
1438265,deu,Er zeigte große Fertigkeiten.
4443526,deu,Die Augen der Dame füllten sich mit Tränen.
2793008,deu,"Das Mädchen versucht, mit nur einem Rad zu fahren. Ihr kleines Fahrzeug nennt man Einrad."
678219,deu,Niemals sah ich ein so schönes Mädchen!
1481636,deu,Ich schreibe nur noch kleine Sätze ohne Kommas.
6619020,deu,Tom sah geistreich aus.
967491,deu,Der Garten war voller gelber Blumen.
940497,deu,Es ist übrigens ein guter Satz.
2083460,deu,Schon bald erreichten sie die Station auf dem Mond.
3832492,deu,Zu welcher Stunde wird das Ende der Welt kommen?
7292999,deu,Ich trinke üblicherweise keinen Kaffee.
2048857,deu,Ich gratuliere dir zu deinem 60. Geburtstag.
2935094,deu,Im Jahr sechzehnhundertneunundzwanzig verbot man die Teilnahme von Frauen an Kabukivorstellungen.
6972180,deu,Tom zog seine Stellenbewerbung zurück.
939813,deu,Mein Cousin hat sich total verändert seit unserer letzten Begegnung: er hat inzwischen drei Kinder und ist ein echter Hausmann geworden.
2655329,deu,Diesmal wirst du nicht allein sein.
2815286,deu,"Zwischen uns erstrecken sich riesige Ozeane, aber unsere Zusammenarbeit klappt bestens. Das ist ein Wunder!"
2215755,deu,"Große Menschen sind stolz, kleine eitel."
1871982,deu,Hast du viel zu tun?
5845956,deu,Jahrelang wurde das Gemälde als ein echter Rembrandt angesehen.
4784217,deu,"Sind englische Muttersprachler es gewohnt, andere Sprachen zu lernen?"
1586084,deu,"Wir waren außerstande, seinen Aufenthaltsort festzustellen."
6126828,deu,"Sie hatten solche Angst, dass der eine sich hinter dem anderen versteckte, und sagten: „Guten Morgen, Großmütterchen! Unsere Stiefmutter hat uns geschickt, dass wir dir unsere Aufwartung machen und dir dienen.“"
756069,deu,Die Schüler protestierten gegen die unfaire Prüfung.
7372626,deu,"Ich finde, es wäre hirnrissig, das zu tun."
6645238,deu,Du hast nichts mehr zu trinken.
3404177,deu,Woran arbeiten Sie denn da gerade?
789300,deu,Plötzlich verdunkelten die Wolken den Himmel.
657066,deu,"Nur weil er weise ist, muss er noch nicht ehrlich sein."
6615309,deu,Tom ist erbärmlich.
1836866,deu,Die Bedeutung ist ein unverzichtbarer Bestandteil des Wortes.
2348631,deu,Sie diskutierten mit Maria über das Problem.
3388198,deu,Da ist was unterm Bett.
1441333,deu,"Junge, hör auf zu quasseln!"
1211356,deu,"Die Touristeninformation gab jedem, der wollte, eine Stadtkarte."
1941820,deu,"Mach die Augen auf, Kauf ist Kauf!"
1694139,deu,Zum ersten Mal unterschreibe ich einen Vertrag.
799462,deu,Wir müssen das Treffen absagen.
7584326,deu,Sie machte eine Anspielung auf seine fehlende Bildung.
1333962,deu,Die Bremsen waren kaputt.
6642150,deu,"Tom weiß, worum es geht."
6726862,deu,"„Die Zeit heilt alle Wunden.“ – „Ach, bleib mir doch weg mit deinen Sprüchen, Tom!“"
814626,deu,Ich bin von Linguaphilen umzingelt!
6150663,deu,Wie viele Sterne gibt es am Himmel?
1306812,deu,"Ich konnte nicht verstehen, was er gesagt hatte."
2589395,deu,Ich schickte Tom eine Nachricht.
2738720,deu,Tom! Zurück an die Arbeit!
1401484,deu,Man hat uns angeschmiert.
343400,deu,"Ich verstehe nicht, worüber ihr redet."
2588654,deu,"Tom fuhr einen Schulbus, bevor er Taxifahrer wurde."
2895813,deu,Männer in meiner Position haben oft Feinde.
6072311,deu,"Tom hatte keine Verbündeten, machte sich aber die verschiedensten Feinde."
3834275,deu,Tom beobachtete Mary und John.
532563,deu,Im Garten gab es keine Rosen.
2894292,deu,"Schade, dass Tom keine Nachricht hinterlassen hat!"
1335837,deu,"Seit er verheiratet ist, sieht er sehr glücklich aus."
6779098,deu,Er hat keine Familie.
2839334,deu,"Der Tod eines Menschen ist immer tragisch, das Krepieren der millionen Menschen ist nur eine reine Statistik."
343079,deu,Er versteckte sich hinter einem großen Felsen.
2581017,deu,"Es gibt fruchtbare Wüsten, wo Straußenköpfe bestens gedeihen."
4009974,deu,Tom scheint viel glücklicher zu sein als Mary.
5403576,deu,War das absichtlich?
7361612,deu,Diskettenlaufwerke sind kaum noch im Einsatz.
3076521,deu,Tom braut sich zu Hause sein eigenes Bier.
1087397,deu,Esperanto wurde 1887 der Welt zum ersten Mal vorgestellt.
1958735,deu,Er hat mich schlecht behandelt.
2808198,deu,Der Vorredner hat bereits alles genauestens dargelegt.
1851617,deu,Brechen wir auf?
1536685,deu,Tom war zur falschen Zeit am falschen Ort gewesen.
6641876,deu,Warum gehst du?
1442383,deu,"Ebenso wie sie bin auch ich der Meinung, dass es verschiedartige Massenmedien geben muss, sowohl staatliche als auch private."
5791155,deu,"Tom, ich danke dir, dass du gekommen bist! Es hat mir gutgetan, mit dir zu reden."
3058744,deu,"Macht, was ihr wollt. Ist mir doch egal."
3939841,deu,"Wenn ich erstmal im Ruhestand bin, widme ich all meine Zeit Tatoeba."
2728085,deu,"Als ich dreiundzwanzig Jahre alt war, war ich indonesischer Meister im Rückenschwimmen."
2337959,deu,Sie überschüttete ihn mit Konfetti.
6289594,deu,Niemand erhob die Hand.
4943723,deu,Die Katze kletterte den Baum hinauf.
5331561,deu,Du bist kein Kanadier.
2156031,deu,"Ich meine, dass sie danach bis heute Morgen gegen fünf in ihrem Zimmer blieb."
5720811,deu,Wirst du nächste Woche nach Boston fahren?
2164361,deu,"Das Gebäude, das ich sah, war sehr groß."
2147468,deu,"Herr Murata, das ist meine Freundin Lisa."
786343,deu,"Zieh deine Jacke aus, denn es ist sehr heiß hier."
7479984,deu,"Tom und Maria sagten Johannes, dass sie glaubten, dass Elke um 2.30 Uhr damit fertig gewesen sei."
465442,deu,Die Kühe essen auf der Weide Gras.
3705054,deu,"Eigentlich hätten wir versprochen, das für uns zu behalten."
5971019,deu,"Wie soll man denn sonst sparen, wenn nicht intelligent?"
7039003,deu,Der Zirkus hat seine Zelte aufgeschlagen.
6476674,deu,"Sie können die Karte ansehen, indem Sie auf den folgenden Link klicken."
2815183,deu,"Ich hoffe, Tom amüsiert sich gut."
6681992,deu,Der Junge da sieht wie Sie aus.
2436843,deu,Damals gab es noch kein Internet.
6615467,deu,Tom gewinnt oft.
4557485,deu,Wer hat Glas erfunden?
3874613,deu,Sie ist erschossen worden!
2717605,deu,Sie sollte in die Schule gehen.
702072,deu,Wann war Ihr letzter Stuhlgang?
3519505,deu,Ich habe es geahnt.
596616,deu,"Lasst euch nicht von ihrer Werbung verführen; ich sehe nicht, wie jemand so etwas zu einem solchen Preis verkaufen kann."
368790,deu,"Es gibt nichts, was dieser Sache ebenbürtig wäre."
3240726,deu,Sie war vor zwei Jahren in London.
620916,deu,Tom hat gestern nicht zu Abend gegessen.
5066459,deu,Maria hat nur eines im Sinn.
869643,deu,Er hat seinen Hut schief aufgesetzt.
5707934,deu,Dies ist ein sehr komplexes Problem.
7441789,deu,Tom kam nie zu Hause an.
561072,deu,Deshalb bin ich zu spät zur Schule gekommen.
7635544,deu,Tom zeigte mir seine Briefmarkensammlung.
6614944,deu,Tom war geblendet.
1842083,deu,"Sie hörten auf zu reden, sobald ich das Zimmer betrat."
570312,deu,Das Treffen wird nächste Woche Montag stattfinden.
1285630,deu,Der Schneider hat keine Kleider.
5437139,deu,Das schnelle Handeln hat auch seine Vorteile.
2461653,deu,Sie sehen wirklich schlecht aus.
6611379,deu,Tom wollte das nicht.
1577175,deu,Sie ist nicht so groß wie er.
3478989,deu,Tom spielt Klavier nach Gehör.
2066647,deu,Vertraue dir selbst — bei dieser eisern Saite Klang erschwingt ein jedes Herz.
1713111,deu,Ich habe mein Telefon im Sitzungszimmer vergessen.
1579505,deu,Warum hilfst du mir gar nicht?
2739785,deu,Das Schicksal war launisch.
4869970,deu,"Wissen Sie, was er vorhat?"
5622191,deu,"Entscheidend ist nicht, dass man gewinnt, sondern mitmacht."
1825273,deu,"Man kann Brailleschrift mit der Hand schreiben, indem man eine Punktschrifttafel und einen Griffel benutzt."
6107586,deu,"Lass dir Zeit! Das ist ein Marathon, kein Sprint."
7224154,deu,Kommt die Putzkolonne morgens oder abends?
499011,deu,Ist der Fisch noch lebendig?
5694096,deu,Hören Sie auf zu reden und gehen Sie zurück an die Arbeit!
3962511,deu,"Wir denken, dass Venedig eine wunderschöne Stadt ist."
1526731,deu,"Ich glaube, du bist die Frau, auf die ich die ganze Zeit gewartet habe!"
5083854,deu,Mir fehlen vor Rührung die Worte.
2329318,deu,"Ich bin der Einzige, der kein Uigurisch kann."
5610823,deu,Ich ziehe jetzt die Notbremse.
3395776,deu,"Teilen Sie ihnen mit, was vorgefallen ist."
7611455,deu,Mögen Sie Bananen?
7464245,deu,Hat Tom den Vertrag schon unterschrieben?
1008114,deu,"Ich habe versucht, die Melodie auswendig zu lernen."
2127279,deu,Sie wurde wegen Gebärmuttervorfall operiert.
6170198,deu,Warum schläfst du noch nicht? Du müsstest doch längst im Bett sein!
3966184,deu,Hans kommt durch seine Dummheit fort.
373096,deu,"Geh schneller, damit du nicht zu spät kommst."
3527681,deu,Ein Sturm riss sämtliche Blätter von den Bäumen.
683,deu,"Das Leben ist eine tödliche, sexuell übertragbare Krankheit."
5313683,deu,Ich will nach Hawaii.
2304819,deu,Die Tochter des Bürgermeisters wurde entführt.
782051,deu,Ich brauche einen Arzt.
4263241,deu,Wie kommt Maria und du zusammen aus?
2629526,deu,"Ja, das wäre eine Methode, die Sache aus der Welt zu schaffen."
2527969,deu,Ich möchte eigentlich nicht darüber sprechen.
3331119,deu,"Die Klagemauer ist ein freiliegender Teil der früheren Westwand des Platzes des zweiten Jerusalemer Tempels, welcher im Jahre 70 n. Chr. während des Jüdischen Krieges von den Römern zerstört wurde."
3563891,deu,Tom wollte abnehmen.
1002793,deu,Der Streit geht weiter!
4709229,deu,"Mein liebes Kind, bleib still!"
5084645,deu,Rede nicht schlecht über andere hinter ihrem Rücken.
742293,deu,Schwimme nicht im Teich.
5441495,deu,Ein Blutgefäß ist in seinem Gehirn geplatzt.
367404,deu,"Wenn ich mehr Zeit hätte, würde ich Tanzen lernen."
7317699,deu,Tom und Maria genossen ein kleines Feierabendgläschen Rotwein zusammen.
1018486,deu,"Amerika ist kein Land, sondern ein Kontinent."
1783531,deu,"Du gehörst zu jenen Fragenden, die ihre Fragen selbst beantworten. Das erspart dem Befragten die Suche nach einer Antwort."
2217453,deu,Maria ist seltsam.
4720468,deu,Tom hat den Nagel auf den Kopf getroffen.
6376123,deu,"Die Theorie, der zufolge sich Homo sapiens auf mehreren Erdteilen getrennt aus Homo erectus entwickelte, kann heute als widerlegt gelten."
2879295,deu,Du brauchst keine Liste.
577331,deu,Das schlägt dem Fass den Boden aus.
3403980,deu,Tom ging mit seinen Kindern in den Zoo.
755720,deu,Ich habe keine Zeit für euch.
6161309,deu,"Tue nichts, was du später bereuen könntest!"
2340228,deu,"Ich hoffe, dass wir einander nach dem Treffen besser gefallen werden."
2345448,deu,Die Frau probiert das Brot.
3303204,deu,"Ich bin den ganzen Weg gelaufen, anderenfalls hätte ich den Zug nicht geschafft."
4803094,deu,Wohin habe ich meine Brille gelegt?
2225018,deu,Ist dein Leben chaotisch?
3220036,deu,"Ich bitte dich, einen vollständigen Satz zu bilden."
2497876,deu,Ohne eine genaue Diagnose kann man einen Kranken nicht heilen.
1090445,deu,"Sie werden für die Frauen, die in dieser Fabrik arbeiten, verantwortlich sein."
2129181,deu,Einstein bezeichnete die Quantenverschränkung als „spukhafte Fernwirkung“. Ebenso hätte vor Einsteins eigener Allgemeiner Relativitätstheorie auch Newtons Gravitationstheorie bezeichnet werden können.
2513653,deu,Tom ist bedürftig.
2765114,deu,"Soweit ich gehört habe, bist du ein guter Freund von Tom."
4609796,deu,Könntest du bitte deine letzte Aussage erklären?
1865591,deu,"Ich fragte ihn, ob er ihre Adresse wüsste."
3978434,deu,In der Stadthalle ist dieser Tage Toms bewegende Ausstellung „Kunst der Traurigkeit“ mit ausdrucksstarken Bildern und Skulpturen zu bewundern.

3866837,deu,Tom erlitt bei einem Sturz vom Fahrrad schwere Kopfverletzungen.
3741883,deu,„Mein Hund hat keine Nase.“ „Wie riecht er?“ „Furchtbar.“

2750435,deu,Tom und Maria unterredeten sich bei einer Tasse Kaffee.
1902350,deu,"Ich fragte mich, wann das Konzert beginnen würde."
4593162,deu,Das Konzert war soso lala.
3030188,deu,"In dieser Welt gibt es nur zwei Tragödien. Die eine ist, nicht zu bekommen, was man möchte, und die andere ist, es zu bekommen."
754806,deu,Die beiden Straßen führen zum Bahnhof.
2796424,deu,Tom redet schon wieder im Schlaf.
2950253,deu,"Wenn wir es nur versuchen, können wir leicht lernen, Unglück zu ertragen. Das Unglück anderer, meine ich."
2690188,deu,Tom wurde beliebt.
3760489,deu,„Das ist nicht meine Angelegenheit“ ist eine sich selbst erfüllende Prophezeiung.
1401439,deu,Wie lange wollen Sie es behalten?
5800583,deu,Tom wurde lange für einen unbesiegbaren Kämpfer gehalten.
1811267,deu,Es gibt kein Heilmittel gegen Alpträume.
851267,deu,Er kam um fünf Uhr zurück.
369926,deu,"Wir waren kaum zurückgekehrt, als es zu regnen begann."
1706127,deu,Das Mädchen trug einen langen Schal um den Hals.
1259299,deu,Über seiner Ich-AG kreist der Pleitegeier.
1210888,deu,Der wahre Freund ist selten.
6619148,deu,Tom ist zurückgetreten.
911812,deu,"Sie ist ziemlich angefressen, weil sie keine Gehaltserhöhung bekommen hat."
608653,deu,"Es war stets eine Freude, mit Ihnen zu arbeiten."
6002763,deu,Sie sind arm wie eine Kirchenmaus.
2752087,deu,"Jetzt weißt du vermutlich, wie Tom sich gefühlt haben muss."
7060421,deu,"Das Wasser, das die Kuh trank, war kühl und frisch."
2738829,deu,"Tun Sie nicht so, als wüssten Sie nicht, worum es geht!"
993276,deu,"Wie ist man zu der Schlussfolgerung gekommen, dass sich die Erde um die Sonne dreht?"
1985861,deu,Sie ergriff meine Hand.
763278,deu,"Meine Mutter musste schwer arbeiten, um uns zu erziehen."
6938825,deu,Die Stachelbirne enthält eine erhebliche Menge an Fasern und ist extrem reich an Antioxidantien.
1904961,deu,"Die Stunde dringt, und rascher Tat bedarf’s."
5986693,deu,"Sie war so müde, dass sie sofort einschlief."
2508477,deu,"Ich glaube an den gesunden Menschenverstand wie an ein Wunder, doch der gesunde Menschenverstand verbietet mir, an Wunder zu glauben."
608429,deu,"Es hat ein bisschen gedauert, bis ich Auto fahren konnte."
2397406,deu,"Erhebe dich, Tom."
4677721,deu,Dieser Bericht ist unvollständig.
2690008,deu,Man darf Menschen nicht nach ihrem Äußeren beurteilen.
1821671,deu,Ich bin kein Mitglied des Clubs.
3798158,deu,"Ich will später nicht bereuen, dass ich in meiner Jugend etwas versäumt habe."
2979061,deu,Er lief weg.
7418736,deu,"Wenn man diese zwei Figuren anders aufstellt, kann man das Rätsel angeblich lösen."
2778636,deu,"Auch die schwächste Frau ist noch stark genug, um mehrere Männer auf den Arm zu nehmen."
1600441,deu,Er tat es für seine Schwester.
4834013,deu,Die Entfernung zwischen Wien und den Grenzen zur Slowakei und zu Ungarn beträgt nur vierzig Kilometer.
1389697,deu,Er war ganz in Gedanken versunken.
1690501,deu,Warum tun wir das?
7464206,deu,"Ich rechne damit, dass Tom weinen wird."
7547676,deu,Sie wäscht gerade ihren Wagen.
4657234,deu,"Adel liegt im Gemüte, nicht im Geblüte."
4737912,deu,"Worum geht es bei einem Vorstellungsgespräch? Nun, du musst sagen, was der Arbeitgeber in spe hören will, inklusive aller verfügbaren Klischees - mit anderen Worten, du musst ein guter Schauspieler sein."
2930956,deu,Tom räumt vermutlich sein Schlafzimmer auf.
2139649,deu,Mein Pfennig ist deines Pfennigs Bruder.
4120806,deu,Hier ist kein Warum.
5662332,deu,Langsam begreife ich es.

1689204,deu,"Den Klugen erkennt man daran, dass er den Mund rechtzeitig schließt."
3183710,deu,"Wenn du mit Tom sprechen willst, wirst du etwa drei Stunden warten müssen."
2490991,deu,"Glücklichsein ist eine Gabe des Schicksals und kommt nicht von außen; man muss es sich selbst erkämpfen. Das ist aber auch tröstend, denn man kann es sich erkämpfen."
1808152,deu,Du solltest diese schlechte Angewohnheit loswerden.
3126854,deu,Ich fliege kommenden Sonntagmorgen nach Amsterdam.
4775202,deu,Darüber besteht keinerlei Zweifel.
536065,deu,Meine Mutter steckt ihre Nase immer in meine Privatangelegenheiten.
2740769,deu,"Menschen, die Zeit haben, sind immer auch Menschen, die nicht glauben, sie müssten alles selbst machen."
6112768,deu,Tom klang ebenso aufgeregt wie Maria.
5962874,deu,Dies macht uns stärker.
6622901,deu,Passe sorgfältig auf das Baby auf.
2927380,deu,Sie sind nervös.
5315377,deu,"Kinderaugen sind klar wie Bergseen, auf deren Grund ein Ungeheuer schlummert."
2877323,deu,Du bist zu blöd zum Blödeln.
775131,deu,Wo hast du diese Puppe gefunden?
2494063,deu,Ich habe meine Schuhe weggeworfen.

2731100,deu,"Die Elbphilharmonie ist ein Symbol der Hafencity, eines neuen Viertels der deutschen Stadt Hamburg."

1983425,deu,"Mach das nie wieder, verstehst du?"
1788250,deu,Alle fünf Kaninchen wurden von den hungrigen Wölfen aufgefressen.
2871561,deu,Trink Cola nicht mit leerem Magen. So schadet sie noch mehr.
4805108,deu,Er mag Mary.
4057810,deu,Habt Tom und du euch schon mal geküsst?
2665937,deu,"Ein Kind zu verlieren, ist das Schlimmste, was man durchmachen kann."
906520,deu,Ich habe meine Website umgestaltet.
7426390,deu,Ich fliege nächsten Montag nach Boston.
1493729,deu,Sie essen diese Dinge.

6002725,deu,Er kennt sein Dorf wie seine eigene Hand.
1422971,deu,"Sie fragte ihn, wie man die Maschine starte."
3372162,deu,Ich werde mit dem Chef der Bank sprechen müssen.
342,deu,"Wie schreibt man ""pretty""?"
1038864,deu,Er ging auf dem Bahnsteig auf und ab.
2435059,deu,"In meinen Brillengläsern kann ich sehen, was hinter mir vor sich geht."
2276620,deu,"Wozu der Lärm, was steht dem Herrn zu Diensten?"
2767815,deu,"Tom beschloss, Maria nichts davon zu erzählen, was geschehen war."
2118690,deu,Esperanto ist eine konstruierte und doch lebende Sprache.
6770078,deu,Leise! Tom denkt nach.
4097540,deu,Mein Vater hat ein neues Auto.
1773691,deu,Wessen Liedtext ist das?
842371,deu,Halt den Schläger fest.

344372,deu,Er jagt gerne.
6866884,deu,Man benutzt die Computer für die Arbeit und zum Lernen.

4181533,deu,Wann habt ihr das gefunden?
7010791,deu,"Tom tat so, als hätte er nicht gehört, was Maria über ihn gesagt hatte."
423828,deu,Katzen mögen lieber Fisch als Fleisch.
1807934,deu,Wann esst ihr euer Mittagessen?
626258,deu,Heute tu' ich nichts mehr.
5917045,deu,"Obwohl ich Handschuhe angezogen hatte, habe ich an den Fingern gefroren."

3137065,deu,Was soll man davon halten?
4339476,deu,Auf der Straße lagen jede Menge Felsbrocken herum.

3877912,deu,Du hast deinen Vater immer geachtet.
2750361,deu,"Du musst Tom für das, was er tat, gehasst haben."
3842231,deu,Wir werden uns wieder treffen.

2504586,deu,Klar. Kennst du einen guten Platz?
944523,deu,"Ich weiß, wie man einen Apfel schält."
2588839,deu,"Ich glaube, Tom wird es hier gefallen."
6626147,deu,"Du willst es, oder?"
4639035,deu,Sie möchten darüber nicht sprechen.
2141651,deu,"Ich weiß nicht, warum ich das gemacht habe."
1657110,deu,Der Detektiv nickte wortlos und beugte sich über die Leiche.
2583541,deu,"Als sie durch die Türe trat, begann mein Herz, schneller zu schlagen."
5215145,deu,Deshalb sitzen wir hier.
587371,deu,Hast du die Nachrichten im Radio gehört?

1973790,deu,Ich kann dich nicht überallhin bringen.
1678164,deu,Ich habe ein Medikament gegen meine Magenschmerzen eingenommen.
6083378,deu,In Toms Aktentasche habe ich eine Gesprächsnotiz gefunden.
4910879,deu,"Die Römer bauten Aquädukte, um sauberes Wasser in die Städte zu leiten."
7005567,deu,Tom erkundigt sich bei dem Verkäufer.

4623547,deu,Ich stelle ihnen kein Bein.
1316810,deu,Er ist zu dumm zum Kopfrechnen.
7432481,deu,"Lass mich nachsehen, ob Tom fertig ist."
3897765,deu,Sie respektiert dich.
1542741,deu,Er stand da wie der Ochs vorm Scheunentor.
484227,deu,Gestern habe ich mit Tony gespielt.

1315698,deu,Er kam mir zu Hilfe.
4757358,deu,Ich bin Toms Opa.
6103107,deu,Sie können nichts dafür.
6062948,deu,Ich will von niemandem mehr verletzt werden.
3233430,deu,"Unter seinem Pseudonym konnte Tom endlich ganz er selbst sein. Losgelöst von allen Erwartungen, die man an ihn stellte, konnte er schreiben, was er wollte, und die Bücher wurden alle ein großer Erfolg."
6865025,deu,Tom wiegt doppelt so viel wie ich.
6634473,deu,Sie waren gerade aufgewacht.
6139770,deu,Tom schloss die Augen und wünschte sich etwas.
4919339,deu,Warum quälst du diesen unschuldigen Menschen?
2079252,deu,Es tauchte mit um so größerer Energie wieder auf.
1810726,deu,Das Medikament wirkte nicht.
4804024,deu,Sie hat einen kleinen Hautfleck von Geburt an.
3276079,deu,"Glaubst du, ich halte mich für einen Idioten?"
1628052,deu,Ich durfte mein Haus nicht verlassen.

6999394,deu,Ich habe keine Flugangst.
7009945,deu,Lesen ist meine Leidenschaft.
3986946,deu,"Tom, ich war das nicht."
2238191,deu,Ein großes Dankeschön für Ihre Hilfe.
3847676,deu,Ich wollte Ihre Unterhaltung nicht belauschen.
4187586,deu,"Ist Lojban mehrdeutig? Das hängt davon ab, was Sie mit „mehrdeutig“ meinen."
1045416,deu,Darf man hier fotografieren?
3044447,deu,Was macht Jane morgen früh?
6920463,deu,Tom war kooperationsunwillig.
1697456,deu,Man hat mich beraubt.
1547104,deu,"Wir haben es verlernt, Grabmäler von Denkmälern zu unterscheiden."

4884077,deu,Sie gleicht einem schönen Traum.
5437665,deu,"Tom schwimmt nicht gerne in Becken, sondern lieber in Seen und Flüssen."

3191848,deu,Das hätten wir wohl besser nicht getan.
1693224,deu,"Ich werde es nicht zulassen, dass dich jemand verletzt."

6770106,deu,Ich niese schon den ganzen Tag.
915831,deu,Diese Frage ist schwer zu beantworten.
1080385,deu,Der Schein trügt.
6770438,deu,"Ich muss fort von hier, ehe Tom und Maria eintreffen."
3839261,deu,"Sie mag es nicht, wenn man ihr sagt, was sie zu tun hat."
4687453,deu,Dein Auge ist nicht gerötet.
6084374,deu,"Wenn du mir im Weg stehst, bin ich dazu nicht im Stande."
7451396,deu,Ich habe Tom eingestellt.
1488278,deu,Der Katze war die Meinung der Maus völlig egal.
1952271,deu,Es wird ihm in die Blüten regnen.
2701008,deu,Behandelt Bücher mit Respekt!
2363384,deu,"Frau Maria spricht gut Deutsch, nicht war?"
3248905,deu,Tom hat keinen Gefallen an moderner Kunst.

1215622,deu,Er ist ein Spätentwickler
2696036,deu,Ich erkannte ihn nicht wieder.
3042792,deu,"Ich freue mich nicht darauf, Tom zu treffen."
5622168,deu,"Das Telefon hat geklingelt, ich bin aber nicht rangegangen."
2878954,deu,Alle Sprengladungen wurden deaktiviert.
973589,deu,Das kostet mich meine Stelle.
3321691,deu,Ich mache Obstsalat.
1791498,deu,Ich muss die Wahrheit über ihn wissen.
5172400,deu,Ich habe es gesehen.
1097663,deu,Am bemitleidenswertesten sind die Sklaven ihrer eigenen Gedanken.

2340907,deu,Ich verstehe überhaupt kein Englisch.
7451606,deu,Ich will Eier.
7592252,deu,"Es tut mir leid, Tom."
1783441,deu,"Tom war betrübt, als er herausfand, dass Maria ein Geldegel war, und Maria war betrübt, als sie herausfand, dass Tom ein armer Schlucker war."
4682989,deu,"Tom weigerte sich, auf Fleisch zu verzichten."
1241804,deu,"Darauf lege ich großen Wert, aus mehreren Gründen."
4801237,deu,Gestern schlüpfte ein Vogeljunges.
2508891,deu,Sie haben beide recht.
6642146,deu,Tom will dich nicht hier haben.
2949751,deu,Die Unwissenheit und die Unlogik der Menschheit bedrückten ihn.

3089766,deu,"Bereits seit Freitag nehme ich ein starkes Medikament, doch die Symptome lassen nicht nach."
5331579,deu,"Tom bat Maria, nicht allein zu gehen."

6642305,deu,Tom sieht uns an.
2628374,deu,"Ich habe nicht viel freie Zeit, deshalb habe ich beschlossen Esperanto zu lernen."

7554920,deu,Es funktioniert jetzt.
1735160,deu,"Ich erinnere mich nicht mehr, wie man dahinkommt."

1971421,deu,"Ich frage mich, ob Tom eine Freundin hat."
2426541,deu,"Den an Schizophrenie leidenden Personen fällt es schwer, ihre Gedanken in Worte zu fassen."

932863,deu,Judy schickte die Kinder ins Bett.
7453001,deu,Tom kaut immer an seinen Fingernägeln.
2204328,deu,Wir wirken mit.
1037479,deu,Sie haben den Hund auf Shiro getauft.
3563894,deu,"Tom hat alles, was er braucht."
6645230,deu,"Du kannst Französisch, oder?"

4259729,deu,Meine Kinder haben keine eigene Zimmer.
457380,deu,Der Unfall machte alle seine Hoffnungen auf Erfolg zu nichte.
4913185,deu,"Alles für meine Freunde, für meine Feinde das Gesetz."

2224064,deu,Da fing die Königstochter an zu weinen.
4913313,deu,Können Sie mir das Programm geben?
747842,deu,Gut gesagt!
3037558,deu,Nicht jede Hoffnung erfüllt sich.
2967302,deu,"Fast hätte ich getan, wessen du mich beschuldigst, aber nur fast!"
4713755,deu,Wo sind deine Zeitungen?
5573945,deu,Ich bin in einem Heißluftballon gefahren.
398012,deu,Wir konnten die Schwierigkeit überwinden.
6331491,deu,Schenke randvoll ein!
1629871,deu,Am Nachmittag wurde das Wetter nass und nebelig.

1314802,deu,Tom ist zum Arzt gegangen.
2980453,deu,Auf wen hast du am Bahnhof gewartet?
1274140,deu,"Sie hasst es, früh aufzustehen."

1746039,deu,Ich muss dieses Medikament schlucken.
932353,deu,Ich habe einen Strafzettel bekommen.

4001381,deu,"Meine arme Großmutter ist jetzt sehr krank und ich fürchte, sie steht an der Schwelle des Todes."
6686095,deu,Lass es nicht fallen!
759079,deu,"Die Gehaltskürzung des Bankkaufmanns war befristet, nicht dauerhaft."
1825729,deu,Frauen haben für die Entwicklung des Führungsnachwuchses eine große Bedeutung. Ohne sie gäbe es überhaupt keinen.
7423915,deu,Tom verstarb im Jahre 2013 in Boston.
3134849,deu,"Wenn Sie möchten, dass Tom Sie respektiert, müssen Sie Tom respektieren."
1542595,deu,"Ich vermute, dass ich dich begleiten werde, aber ich habe mich noch nicht entschieden."
4020133,deu,Tom liest immer.
1849221,deu,Die Wagenfolge ist heute in umgekehrter Reihenfolge.
1494640,deu,Der reiche Händler adoptierte den Jungen und setzte ihn als seinen Erben ein.
6625069,deu,Was bedeutet es dir?
5809434,deu,"Das Einzige, was ich brauche, ist ein kleines bisschen „DU“."
1645671,deu,"Sobald du dir vertraust, sobald weisst du zu leben."
6949282,deu,"Ich merke schon, worauf du abzielst."
1919457,deu,Es gibt keine Wirkung ohne Ursache.
924670,deu,Im Haus spukt es.
2263437,deu,"Ober- und Unterschenkel werden durch ein Gelenk verbunden, welches Knie genannt wird."
6934851,deu,"Nutze jede Gelegenheit, um klüger zu werden."
1023484,deu,Ich fühle mich überhaupt nicht gut.
720465,deu,Ich bin gerade nicht sicher.
1671949,deu,Er bat mich um ein Stelldichein.
6940224,deu,"Lasst uns essen, solange das Essen noch warm ist."
3405974,deu,Die gute Nachricht: Wir brauchen nicht hin.
369582,deu,Bete und arbeite.
3044320,deu,"Ihr wisst, dass das nicht funktionieren wird."
3107180,deu,"Wenn er nicht so faul wäre, könnte er jetzt schon reich sein."
5549077,deu,Er ist kein Mann der lauten Töne.
3714908,deu,Tom sah von der schwindelnden Höhe des Wolkenkratzers auf die Stadt hinab.
3270097,deu,Er überlässt alles dem Zufall.
540966,deu,"Du hattest mir gesagt, du hättest einen schönen Arsch. War das dann irreführende Werbung?"
6304443,deu,"Es ist nicht empfehlenswert, einen Minirock zu tragen, wenn man zu einer Beerdigung geht."
816667,deu,Habt ihr bereits zu Abend gegessen?
2929322,deu,"Tom küsste Maria, als Johannes und Elke gerade nicht hinsahen."
1847093,deu,"Für den Fall, dass ich den Zug verpassen sollte, fang ruhig schon mal an."
2226700,deu,"Die Melodie, selbst wenn sie einstimmig vorgetragen wird, vereinigt alle Elemente der Tonkunst; denn sie trägt neben rhythmischer Bewegung auch schon ihren Harmoniegehalt in sich."
2217878,deu,Das hier ist ein Alptraum.
767227,deu,"Du hast die Möglichkeit, zu reisen, wohin du willst."
6614822,deu,Wer hat Tom gefangen?
7664498,deu,Tom wurde am 20. Oktober 2013 hingerichtet.
685838,deu,"Es ist gefährlich für Kinder, auf dieser Straße zu spielen."
5285749,deu,"Es ist keine Übertreibung zu sagen, dass er ein Wunderkind ist."
3079982,deu,Wir ernannten ihn zu unserem Repräsentanten.
1077389,deu,Der Baum der Schwäbischen Alb ist die Buche.
1600736,deu,Das ist wirklich beschämend.
6377258,deu,Womit kann ich dich überzeugen?
4050098,deu,Wart ihr jemals in Paris?
1081172,deu,"Tom bat Mary, Salat zur Feier mitzubringen."
6615207,deu,Tom ist reserviert.
5983976,deu,Ich suche die Polizeiwache. Können Sie mir helfen?
6838236,deu,Tom wurde entlassen und aus dem Gebäude geführt.
6999461,deu,"Denkst du, ich sollte es ihm sagen?"
5067556,deu,Finnland ist keine Utopie.
7664406,deu,"Wann habt ihr beschlossen, Tom das zu erlauben?"
6218312,deu,Mary glasierte den Kuchen.
1973224,deu,Durch Abstimmungsbeschluss wurde er ausgeschlossen.
5206050,deu,"Ich hoffe, euch morgen zu sehen."
4053462,deu,Ein überladener Wagen bricht leicht.
6913119,deu,Lebenslauf: Unruhig und beirrt ging er seinen Weg...
2144875,deu,"Was? Schon acht Uhr? Meine Güte, wie die Zeit verfliegt, wenn wir Schach spielen!"
4109076,deu,"Tom las keine der Nachrichten, die Maria ihm geschickt hatte."
1551922,deu,Gib mir die Fernbedienung zurück!
7205420,deu,Das wäre furchtbar.
7697120,deu,Maria leidet unter Angstzuständen.
2341192,deu,Maria spricht kein Englisch.
2348534,deu,Wir sind mit Maria nach Boston gegangen.
3570143,deu,"Sie sagen doch meinen Eltern nichts, oder?"
6689026,deu,"Es ist schon zwei Jahre her, dass wir uns getrennt haben."
1557223,deu,Tom kann fünf Minuten lang die Luft anhalten.
6615644,deu,"Wenn ich eine neue Idee habe, befrage ich meine Freunde. Wenn sie antworten ""Du spinnst"", dann entwickle ich den Prototypen."
3429016,deu,Tom ist ein ganz schön guter Gitarrenspieler.
1623678,deu,Hat sich deine gute Laune schon verflüchtigt?
5325947,deu,"Wer kein Messer hat, kann kein Brot schneiden."
360593,deu,Bill ist ein großartiger Kämpfer.
1791936,deu,Ich werde viele Sätze auf Berberisch schreiben.
7003221,deu,Sie wurden beschädigt.
6949296,deu,Sie will einen Anschlag auf ihn verüben.
3224705,deu,Fühlst du dich von diesem Buch irgendwie angezogen?
7427151,deu,"Tom ist sehr krank. Die Ärzte sagen, es besteht nur wenig Hoffnung auf Genesung."
2137315,deu,"Danke, ich komme dein Land gerne mal besuchen."
863926,deu,Gestern haben wir gesprochen.
4891472,deu,Was denken die anderen?
1578211,deu,"Ich weiß, welches der beiden Mädchen dir gefällt."
2573452,deu,Sie schlagen sich gut in ihren Kursen an der Schule.
708688,deu,Ein Unfall ist passiert.
860353,deu,Darf ich ein Bild von dir machen?
4622762,deu,Ich beize sie nicht.
1848819,deu,Mach zu und bring mir etwas zu trinken!
5167308,deu,Er ist der nachgebende Teil der Ehe.
6696303,deu,Wann scheint uns das Glück?
3951077,deu,Zeit ist nicht Geld - Zeit ist Leben.
6619583,deu,Ich bin Toms Zahnarzt.
7452954,deu,Tom irrt sich wieder.
3390769,deu,Ich brauche diese Information sofort.
4540843,deu,"Ich dachte er sei gescheit, doch seine Lehrer haben mich von diesem Irrtum befreit."
3383486,deu,Wie wollt ihr das anstellen?
1265622,deu,Fakten sind der schwächste Punkt unserer Propaganda.
1824558,deu,"Es war taktvoll von dir, es vor ihm geheim zu halten."
7341834,deu,Tom wird wahrscheinlich als Zeuge geladen werden.
7418522,deu,"„Behalte mein Geheimnis bitte für dich!“ – „Nur, wenn du mir jede Woche die Hälfte deines Taschengeldes gibst!“ – „Das ist ja Erpressung! Magst du’s also sagen, aber unsere Freundschaft ist damit auch beendet!“"
1674113,deu,"Tom war völlig unschlüssig, was er in dieser Situation sagen sollte."
7430948,deu,"Tom wirkt nicht erfreut, euch zu sehen."
863907,deu,Ich kann nichts sehen!
6855756,deu,"Lass uns spazierengehen, nachdem es aufgehört hat zu regnen."
1918870,deu,Die Berge kreißen und ein Mäuslein wird geboren.
4157382,deu,"Ich wollte, Tom wäre hier."
4463408,deu,Ich bin gegen Katzen allergisch.
366461,deu,Fantastisch!
6038761,deu,Bitte vertreibe es aus deinen Erinnerungen!
2595908,deu,"Das war das Buch, das sich letzte Woche am besten verkauft hat."
676,deu,"Eine Meinung ist nur dann schockierend, wenn sie eine Überzeugung ist."
2506869,deu,Kommt ihr zu der Fete?
442852,deu,Den Nagel auf den Kopf treffen.
3780506,deu,Tom ist ein junger und gutaussehender Mann.
7730303,deu,"Er versäumt es keinen Tag, seiner Mutter zu schreiben."
2348493,deu,Glückliche Umstände machen die Herzen übermütig.
2561514,deu,Darf man hier essen?
2650884,deu,Wien ist Hauptstadt Österreichs.
682853,deu,Sie haben eine weise Entscheidung getroffen.
1991053,deu,Tom grüßte wortlos und erhob sich.
6625853,deu,"Ich sagte, es wird mir gut gehen."
1489241,deu,Der Junge ist mutig.
1388577,deu,Ich bin aus England.
849551,deu,Die Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika haben die Sklaverei abgeschafft.
799923,deu,Installier Linux!
3792425,deu,Wie willst du uns denn einen sehr großen Gefallen tun?
2369398,deu,Mir erscheint der Satz in seiner jetzigen Form eleganter.
3562719,deu,Man wird hier fett.
2751896,deu,Was wolltest du mir zeigen?
1826948,deu,"Das Herz hat seine Beweggründe, von denen die Vernunft nichts weiß."
7479265,deu,"Tom und Maria sagten Johannes, sie hätten Elke schon seit Jahren nicht mehr gesehen."
3854994,deu,Ich würde dies lieber nicht noch einmal machen.
4510215,deu,Toms Tochter ist 13 Jahre alt.
6611618,deu,Hat Tom das jemals getan?
1717914,deu,"An Ideen fehlt es nicht, aber an Männern, sie auszuführen."
1450779,deu,"In Warschau hat er das Klubhaus des Amateur-Orchesters, das er dirigierte, mit Gemälden verziert."
1545207,deu,Such zuverlässige Hinweise.
1630897,deu,"Als Gott die Welt erschuf, gab er den Europäern die Uhr, den Afrikanern die Zeit."
6644976,deu,"Es wird gut sein, nach Hause zu kommen."
6303858,deu,Ein Windhauch kam und wehte Kürtchens Hut weit weg.
914879,deu,"Es wird gesagt, dass er krank ist."
1527655,deu,Tom hat die Brücke in die Luft gejagt.
1912703,deu,Ihre Art zu tanzen ist bewundernswert.
1181591,deu,"Ich traf mich mit einem Freund, den ich seit drei Jahren nicht mehr gesehen hatte."
5064102,deu,Ich habe ihn einen Baum fällen sehen.
4591465,deu,Ich freue mich so für euch beide.
1426557,deu,Die Sorge verleiht kleinen Dingen einen großen Schatten.
1902202,deu,"Danke, dass du mein Freund bist!"
2052876,deu,Mein herzliches Beileid zum Tod deines Vaters.
6671836,deu,Wir kommen dich holen.
2048871,deu,"Ich habe Ihren Wunsch erfüllt, lieber Kollege."
3203096,deu,Tom und Maria sind schon drinnen.
2307428,deu,Seit zehn Jahren liegt er nun seinem Vater auf der Tasche.
781863,deu,Haben Sie irgendein Problem damit?
1737260,deu,"Flackernde Kerzen, in eurem Licht erbeben verwandte Herzen."
3839738,deu,Werdet ihr alle morgen hier sein?
6669298,deu,Sind das hier deine Handschuhe?
7452991,deu,Tom heiratet im Oktober.
689395,deu,"Nur, wenn es nicht zu viel Umstände macht."
7010520,deu,Vergiss die Getränke nicht!
1274407,deu,Mit jedem verbrannten Buch wird die Welt ein bisschen heller.
3118176,deu,"Alles endete ebenso plötzlich, wie es begonnen hatte."
7560797,deu,Gebt euch nächstes Mal mehr Mühe.
963197,deu,Cathy kann Französisch und Deutsch.
673039,deu,Er arbeitet nur tagsüber.
4963207,deu,"Oh, da ist eine Muschel!"

6025796,deu,Heute ist der zweite Tag dieses Monats.
510354,deu,Alle Studenten lieben Ferien.
6865766,deu,Wir bieten die passende Lösung für alle Zwecke und Gelegenheiten.

1569430,deu,Er lebt in einer kleinen Provinzstadt.
1096684,deu,"Oft kennt ein Pantoffelheld nicht seine Probleme, bis er mit einem glücklichen Junggesellen gesprochen hat."
3005620,deu,Eines Tages wird die Wahrheit ans Licht kommen.
6298937,deu,"Ist es immer gut, die Wahrheit zu sagen?"
1690978,deu,"Es ist schwer zu glauben, dass Tom nicht bewusst war, dass Maria in ihn verliebt war."
3040550,deu,Sie werden nicht erschossen.
3376207,deu,Toms Bemerkung war unsensibel.
2092812,deu,Es klingt wie ein Traum.
1713517,deu,Tom wischt den Tisch ab.
2333954,deu,"Ein Tier verteidigt sein Territorium. Doch das Tier kämpft nur, wenn es angegriffen wird. Menschen greifen jedoch mitunter einen Ausländer an, selbst wenn dieser nicht beabsichtigt, etwas zu stehlen."
7478543,deu,Ihr müsst müde sein.
1904362,deu,"Was könnten die uns sagen, was wir nicht schon wüssten?"
2632731,deu,"Ich habe Tom gesagt, dass mit Maria alles in Ordnung sei."
4900755,deu,"Wer leiht, reißt sich den Bart aus."

2313375,deu,"Es war ein echt heißer Sommer. Die Blätter fielen von den Bäumen, obwohl es noch nicht Herbst war."
2061573,deu,Glücklicherweise hat der Haifischbiss keine Hauptarterie in Mitleidenschaft gezogen.
5585360,deu,"Tom lebt nach dem Motto „Dumm ist, wer ehrlich ist“ und betrügt, wo immer er nur kann."
2021112,deu,Seine Logik lässt sich in keiner Weise verteidigen.
5835721,deu,Wir fahren mit dem Zug um acht.
5732755,deu,Das ist 30 Meter lang.
450612,deu,Der Hund ist der beste Freund des Menschen.
5712891,deu,Warum reden wir nicht jetzt darüber?
1898617,deu,Du musst nichts weiter tun als warten.
3242028,deu,Ich hätte gerne einen Termin bei Dr. King.
831347,deu,"Ich wünschte, Sie würden nicht so viel rauchen."
599298,deu,Ich hatte letzte Nacht Ärger mit der Polizei.
2932519,deu,Wir sind seelenverwandt.
2490360,deu,"Dieser Schüler gibt manchmal vor, krank zu sein."
2881015,deu,"Das ist deine Schuld, nicht meine."
1544308,deu,Er hat mit dem Vorsitzenden gesprochen.
3276054,deu,Würdet ihr bitte aufhören so laut zu singen? Wir sind keine billige Kneipe.
3881115,deu,"Sie wusste, etwas stimmte nicht."
1103718,deu,"Tom konnte an Marys Akzent erkennen, dass sie wahrscheinlich aus Irland war."
712335,deu,Ich denke sie wird kommen.
6641372,deu,Wie willst du Tom aufhalten?
5377319,deu,Tom hat unser Angebot abgelehnt.
1734520,deu,"Mir ist entsetzlich übel. Ich glaube, ich muss mich übergeben!"
979624,deu,"Das ist nicht der Junge, der gestern hier war."
4627801,deu,Ich tanze nicht für Sie.
2925172,deu,Ich kam dort nur knapp mit dem Leben davon.
579274,deu,Ich mach' dir doch nicht den Prügelknaben.
6906966,deu,Was bezweckt Tom damit?
1301418,deu,Amerika - die Entwicklung von der Barbarei zur Dekadenz ohne Umweg über die Kultur.
2340390,deu,Sie hat zugenommen.
3053205,deu,Wo kommt ihr her?
1071014,deu,"Wenn du nichts Freundliches zu sagen hast, dann sag gar nichts."
4849703,deu,Sie wissen es besser.
411746,deu,"Sie müssen sich entschuldigen, wenn Sie ihn treffen."
1935228,deu,Liege ich richtig?
2799591,deu,"„Schön ist es hier“, sagte er, „aber ich bin so müde, dass mir die Augen zufallen; ich werde etwas schlafen.“"
394250,deu,Was für ein schöner Garten.
1318078,deu,"Ratet mal, was er mir erzählt hat."
5805853,deu,Es schneit schon seit drei Tagen in Folge.
1195793,deu,Wie viele Blumen kaufst du?
3189388,deu,Warum hast du Tom nicht einfach bezahlt?
4764186,deu,"Wenn du das sagst, wirst du dein Gesicht verlieren."
408783,deu,Du kannst mich Bob nennen.
6325016,deu,Toms Schwester ist jünger als meine.
2869296,deu,Den guten Steuermann lernt man erst im Sturme kennen.
2216095,deu,Die meisten Vögel sind nachtblind.
5319837,deu,Man hat nichts geändert.
1847911,deu,"Forscher sagen, dass es einfacher ist, Gewicht zu verlieren, wenn man drei anständige Mahlzeiten am Tag verzehrt."
5905735,deu,Wie bald können wir anfangen?
6443580,deu,"Egal was kommt, ich werde nicht aufgeben, das ist sicher!"
1500511,deu,"Ich hoffe, dass sich das Brot bis morgen hält."
656959,deu,"Er ist nicht reich, aber glücklich."
3749530,deu,Es herrschte tödliches Schweigen.
2833653,deu,Ist das etwas Gutes oder etwas Schlechtes?
3099585,deu,Mongolisches Essen esse ich nicht.
360726,deu,Wissenschaftliche Entdeckungen machen die Welt nicht immer besser.
1855515,deu,"Mitgegangen, mitgefangen, mitgehangen."
2228474,deu,Die Wolke da sieht für mich wie ein Kaninchen aus.
368669,deu,Das ist in Japan eine ganz gewöhnliche Begebenheit.
4434281,deu,Kate läuft gerade auf dem Sportplatz.
1454522,deu,Deutsche Autos gehören zu den besten.
347991,deu,Ich habe darüber nachgedacht.
3700778,deu,Ich habe viele Menschen enttäuscht.
2650081,deu,Sie pflanzten Apfelbäume.
3766322,deu,Er ist jetzt Student.
1888418,deu,Jedem unterlaufen Fehler.
1336478,deu,Hole bitte die Wäsche rein.
3598310,deu,Natürlich möchte ich nicht sterben. Dennoch ist das Leben eine Qual.
2478815,deu,Wir haben am Valentinstag miteinander Schluss gemacht.
3083750,deu,Tierschinder sind oft auch Leuteschinder.
2403847,deu,Sie hörten nicht auf zu streiten.
5805921,deu,"Ich denke, dass Tom freundlich ist."
736495,deu,Es ist kein Fleisch mehr im Kühlschrank.
6218445,deu,"Der Polizist verlangte, Toms Führerschein zu sehen."
6948929,deu,Das macht mir einen Riesenspaß.
1813598,deu,Drei Menschen wurden nach der Überschwemmung vermisst.
5608450,deu,"Man muss kein Genie zu sein, um das zu kapieren."
2119114,deu,Ihr habt das Spiel noch nicht verloren.
2730526,deu,"Sie spricht gut Englisch, ebenso gut wie ihr Bruder."
449675,deu,Er entkräftete das Gerücht.
1907417,deu,Sie haben drei Nachrichten.
4774753,deu,Flink wie ein Wiesel lief das Kind über Stock und Stein.
6170494,deu,"Tom schaut jemandem, den ich kenne, ziemlich ähnlich."
6324197,deu,Maria rang mit dem Tode und unterlag. Tränenüberströmt überbrachte Tom den anderen die traurige Nachricht.
1235562,deu,Ich mag die französische Küche.
3144263,deu,Ich habe vor Rechtsanwalt zu werden.
3065886,deu,Ich bin viel älter als ihr.
4245674,deu,"Nein, ich habe nicht reserviert."
2207297,deu,"Die Kinder kennen weder Vergangenheit noch Zukunft, und - was uns Erwachsenen kaum passieren kann - sie genießen die Gegenwart."
1134,deu,Nimm deine Sachen und geh.
2987953,deu,"Ich weiß nicht, was das sein mag, das ewige Leben. Aber dieses hier, das diesseitige, ist ein schlechter Scherz."
6083183,deu,"Ich weiß nicht, wie viele es gibt, wichtiger ist, dass es noch welche gibt."
1956816,deu,Man kann das Dorf mit dem Bus erreichen.
6681935,deu,Hört mal! Es ist fast sieben und ihr habt euch noch nicht mal gewaschen.
5919858,deu,Im Büro kann ich kein Nickerchen machen.
1834476,deu,"Was ich jetzt brauche, ist eine Mütze Schlaf."
696015,deu,"Sie hatte nicht versprochen, dass sie wieder herkommt."
7121865,deu,"Maria weiß nicht, wie es weitergehen soll."
2937527,deu,Tom hat gehinkt.
1486387,deu,Er hat eine staatliche Schule besucht.
924804,deu,"Wenn ich kein Geld gehabt hätte, hätte ich kein Haus."
928703,deu,"Sarah, kannst du die Fensterläden zumachen?"
1690578,deu,Wer kontrolliert das Internet?
3712879,deu,Rufe mich nicht.
1950484,deu,Sie versteckt sich im Wandschrank.
6933216,deu,Tom ist ein elender Krachmacher.
7441794,deu,Toms Computer ist abgestürzt.
5277886,deu,Vitoria-Gasteiz wird scherzhaft oft Siberia-Gasteiz genannt.
563737,deu,"Ich wusste nicht, dass sie verheiratet war."
929731,deu,Taro regt sich unheimlich schnell auf.
1446082,deu,Es ist schweinekalt heute.
901132,deu,"Manche Leute sind unzufrieden, wenn sie entdecken, dass sie keinen Grund zur Unzufriedenheit mehr haben."
404949,deu,Ihre Hände waren so kalt wie Eis.
1761206,deu,Der Hacker verschaffte sich Zugang zu sensiblen Dateien in der Datenbank der Firma.
4465636,deu,Dieses Kleid passt ihr perfekt.
1690546,deu,Tom misstraut Europäern.
1657026,deu,Der Ton ihrer Stimme deutete Ungeduld an.
3713577,deu,Ich war bestürzt über die Nachricht.
5288784,deu,"Ich bin verliebt, doch ich weiß nicht, ob das auf Gegenseitigkeit beruht."
2485371,deu,"Die Leute, die man sich in ihrer Jugend unmöglich alt denken kann, gerade die geben die besten Alten."
2659342,deu,Das war offensichtlich ein Witz.
7456474,deu,Ich habe nicht gegessen.
2093407,deu,Gähn! Ich gehe ins Bett.
572501,deu,"Das Konzert war toll, aber es war kalt im Saal."
786899,deu,Wie heißt diese Wegkreuzung?
4310066,deu,Du siehst heute glücklich aus.
1693381,deu,Wir sehen sie gelegentlich.
2898000,deu,Lege es auf den Tisch!
1004974,deu,"Als der Regen aufhörte, wurde das Tennismatch umgehend fortgesetzt."
1561041,deu,Du brauchst dich nicht zu beeilen.
1416497,deu,"Hüte dich vor einem Mann, der im Zorne lächeln kann!"
5334135,deu,Tom erzählte seiner kleinen Tochter Maria jeden Abend vor dem Schlafengehen eine spannende Geschichte.
5745756,deu,"Ich habe mal gehört, dass man, wenn man Bier trinkt, eher Gefahr läuft, von Mücken gestochen zu werden, als wenn man keines trinkt."
4637874,deu,Ich höre niemanden.
1737547,deu,"Da ist nichts, worüber man sich ärgern soll."
4852748,deu,"Man sagt, er ist wohl über achtzig, aber ich meine dennoch, er ist höchstens fünfzig und scheint nur aufgrund von Alkohol älter zu sein."
1765370,deu,Hören Sie das Rascheln?
2973585,deu,Sind Sie schon mal angeeckt mit diesem Standpunkt?
330457,deu,"Wo wohnen Sie? ""Ich wohne in Tokyo."""
1741174,deu,Diese Sache ist inzwischen gekärt.
1823175,deu,Ich möchte Ihnen allen nur für Ihre Arbeit danken!
3521459,deu,Das ist ein merkwürdiges Satzgebilde.
709804,deu,Der Kassierer verpackte die Lebensmittel des Kunden in eine Tüte.
5962737,deu,Bist du wirklich ein Ausländer?
5749867,deu,Das ist doch der Hammer!
1081830,deu,"Hilfe, Hilfe, ich flehe Sie an, rufen Sie einen Arzt!"
1243447,deu,Das fällt nicht in meinen Bereich.
4731065,deu,Ich schere mich nicht um das Risiko.
5165826,deu,„Diese Pralinen schmecken aber gut!“ – „Davon hat Tom neunundvierzig gegessen.“ – „Tom war schon immer ein Gourmand.“
2906639,deu,"Du kannst hier schlafen, wenn du möchtest."
2197301,deu,"Nach einem Besuch bei einem Orden, sagte Martin gleich auf der Türschwelle: „Alles ist schön und schwer in Ordnung, ein Leben für edle Ziele! Nur das Zölibat ist nicht nach meinem Geschmack.“"
4998421,deu,Ein braver Junge sagt so etwas nicht.
2703510,deu,"Der Welt Schlüssel heißt Demut. Ohne ihn ist alles Klopfen, Horchen, Spähen umsonst."
384204,deu,Ich hasse meine Nachbarn.
6854359,deu,"Rate mal, wer hinter dir ist."
6447007,deu,Fast alle von Großmutters Vasen sind sehr wertvoll.
3150131,deu,"Ich bezweifle, dass Thomas glücklich ist."
6851915,deu,"Wer trotz deiner Fehler bei dir bleibt, der liebt dich wirklich."
4425679,deu,"Um mich fit zu halten, benutze ich jede Gelegenheit, um mich auf mein Fahrrad zu schwingen."
7478848,deu,"Tom und Maria sagten Johannes, dass sie glaubten, Elke sei nicht verheiratet."
401827,deu,Sie trauerte um den Tod ihres einzigen Sohnes.
2204104,deu,Tom hat eingelenkt.
1224466,deu,Die Frage ist und bleibt unbeantwortbar.
814995,deu,Ich habe gerade aufgewaschen.
5983998,deu,Ich sehe keinerlei Unterschied.
1747607,deu,Wann haben Sie das letzte Mal in diesem Raum geschlafen?
1818791,deu,"Wer es glaubt, wird selig."
746365,deu,Dieser Wind ist Anzeichen eines Sturms.
350202,deu,Er ging in der Stadt spazieren.
6449758,deu,"Wenn du schon online bist,kannst du auch mal Hallo sagen."
454775,deu,Wohnst du hier?
7448696,deu,Du hast einige gute Argumente.
353064,deu,"Er sagte, dass er nicht hereinkommen würde, aber letztendlich ist er hereingekommen."
3404140,deu,Warum haben Sie nicht geheiratet?
6946302,deu,"Speedy Gonzales, wann wirst du endlich mal gescheit?"
5857146,deu,"Ich weiß, was sie haben."
2669586,deu,Ich habe eure Nachricht erhalten.
5745745,deu,"Tom sagte, dass er oft Wurzelbier trinke, Fichtenbier aber nicht nur noch nie probiert, sondern sogar noch nie davon gehört habe."
2233405,deu,"Die schönste Erfahrung, die wir machen können, ist die Erfahrung des Unbegreiflichen."
6205979,deu,"Den Beschwerden, derentwegen Maria den Arzt konsultierte, wurde außer einem Nicken keine Beachtung geschenkt; dafür nahm man ihr aber Blut ab, man stellte fest, dass ihre Werte in Ordnung waren, und die Beschwerden verschwanden von ganz allein. Ende gut, alles gut, möchte man meinen."
1545015,deu,"Er hat es versäumt zu tun, was er gesagt hatte."
5089393,deu,Dein Französisch hat sich definitiv verbessert.
351740,deu,Ich weiß nicht.
2746070,deu,Hast du schon einmal etwas maßanfertigen lassen?
2416967,deu,Zuhören können ist der halbe Erfolg.
3707582,deu,"Tom versuchte, lustig zu sein."
2802834,deu,Erzählen Sie mir von Tom!
670122,deu,Sind zehntausend Yen genug?
1645600,deu,Du hast den Vorteil einer guten Bildung.
541133,deu,Mach die Tür zu.
4889994,deu,"Meines Erachtens liegt die Betonung bei der Getrenntschreibung auf ""sehen""."
3549657,deu,"Tom hat mir gerade gesagt, dass er eine neue Arbeit gefunden hat."
399647,deu,Wir versorgten die Flüchtlinge mit Decken.
1902380,deu,"Im Supermarkt gab es nicht das, was ich wollte."
1545657,deu,"Es stellte sich heraus, wir waren in dem gleichen Zug."
2854390,deu,Es soll alles vergessen sein!
1953643,deu,Ich komme nicht über dich hinweg.
2227105,deu,Ausweichen muss man nach rechts.
1758565,deu,"Ich glaube, das kann ich bejahen."
1046102,deu,"Tom rief Mary an, um sich bei ihr zu entschuldigen, aber sie legte auf."
7636692,deu,Tom hat nichts zu tun.
2477654,deu,"Der gravierendste Schaden wird Tatoeba dadurch zugefügt, dass an korrekten Sätzen mit korrekten Übersetzungen Änderungen vorgenommen werden."
801617,deu,Irgendetwas riecht hier verdorben.
643588,deu,Er lag auf dem Rücken.
5212232,deu,Die Tore sind geöffnet worden.
747841,deu,Ich benötige ein Passfoto.
1244514,deu,Jetzt wird’s Ernst!
417043,deu,Er stellte seine neue Uhr zur Schau.
7085360,deu,Dieser Hund läuft schnell.
6938994,deu,Wie lernt man am besten schwimmen?
2065870,deu,Ich bin außer Übung.
7234297,deu,Tom fing an zu sinken.
6921257,deu,Grüßen Sie mir die Heimat!
1103402,deu,An diesem Tag wurde ich 23 Jahre alt.
2735731,deu,Ich möchte das nicht sehen.
967369,deu,Das machte ihm eine Heidenangst.
1398706,deu,Aus der Distanz betrachtet sieht das wie ein Mann aus.
1367783,deu,"Wir danken Ihnen für Ihre Treue gegenüber unserer Firma und erlauben uns, Ihnen unseren neuen Herbstkatalog zu senden."
2791993,deu,Tom und Maria sind sich einig.
1715120,deu,"Ja, er ist ein Witzbold! Daran ist kein Zweifel."
622197,deu,Der Fluss ist schön.
1805245,deu,Wissenschaftler sind alle ein wenig wie Kinder.
1892903,deu,Auch Wolkenkratzer haben mal als Keller angefangen.
551499,deu,Du musst deine Hausaufgaben vor dem Abendessen machen.
7566909,deu,"Tom behauptete, er habe die Prüfung bestanden."
779267,deu,Das Problem erfordert sofortige Aufmerksamkeit.
7038294,deu,Für einen armen Vater kannst du nichts dafür – aber für einen armen Schwiegervater sehr wohl.
4961296,deu,Könntest du uns in Ruhe lassen?
7046721,deu,Tom schreibt einem Freund.
2085042,deu,Tom packte Maria am Arm und zerrte sie in Richtung Tür.
7636557,deu,Tom ist der schnellste Läufer aus unserer Klasse.
4738318,deu,Was kannst du für sie tun?
3234168,deu,Diese Dokumente sind jetzt an einem sicheren Ort.
2263323,deu,Ich werde immer für dich dasein.
2745866,deu,Tom und ich müssen einiges nachholen.
1928567,deu,Ich habe Schrunden am Fuß.
6818986,deu,Tom lacht praktisch niemals.
5491146,deu,Tom gab Maria einen Schlüssel für seine Wohnung.
6969823,deu,Toms Vertrag läuft am 20. Oktober aus.
3388232,deu,"Danke, dass du mich deinen Kontakten hinzugefügt hast!"
1072908,deu,"Vielleicht wird mein Enkel der erste Mensch sein, der den Mars betritt."
2392931,deu,"Man wird alt, das hat sein Gutes; man ist zufrieden an Knochen und Leder, an sich und andern."
1771794,deu,Dieses Brot ist groß.
5104191,deu,Tom stellte sich auf Marias Seite.
2522017,deu,"Ich hoffe, es geht ihr gut."
6403935,deu,"Meine Tante hilft mir, wenn ich Geld brauche."
4711787,deu,Du musst meine Kinder treffen.
363424,deu,Sie ist zu einer Frau herangewachsen.
1151381,deu,Ich suche meine eigene Wahrheit.
1513316,deu,Tom hat sehr wenig Geld.
1691477,deu,Du gehst mir mächtig auf den Geist.
5466817,deu,Trachten sind aus historischen Alltagsgewändern entstanden.
3189358,deu,Dafür bezahle ich euch.
5830124,deu,Tom hat das getan.
333643,deu,Bill kann schneller als Bob laufen.
2147319,deu,Drachen haben Flügel und spucken Feuer.
2461922,deu,Bitte sprich laut.
2215427,deu,Sie liebt dieses Spiel.
989613,deu,Du hast es getan!
5707900,deu,Dieser Fernseher wurde in China hergestellt.
2830471,deu,"Wenn Karrieren schwindelnde Höhen erreichen, ist der Schwindel häufig nicht mehr nachzuweisen."
7712600,deu,Er hat ein gewisses literarisches Talent.
5133467,deu,Jeder muss mit dem Weinen aufhören.
5122807,deu,Alte Leute tragen die Augen in der Tasche und die Füße in der Hand.
1438985,deu,Der König hat sich ausgezogen.
6951996,deu,Du drückst die falsche Taste.
788532,deu,Er begrüßte seinen Freund durch Handschlag.
6166758,deu,Hältst du deine Pläne wirklich für realistisch?
350184,deu,Gestern Abend haben wir den Präsidenten im Fernsehen reden gehört.
6611454,deu,Es ist in der Nähe von meinem Haus.
3033530,deu,Sie sieht euer Pferd.
666552,deu,Trotz der Sprachschwierigkeiten wurden wir bald Freunde.
2810549,deu,"Tom hatte nicht erwartet, dass der Test so einfach sein würde."
4537432,deu,Zwischen denen herrscht auf jeden Fall mehr als nur Freundschaft.
5506255,deu,Wo soll ich meinen Koffer hinstellen?
1396051,deu,Werbung geht mir immer mehr auf den Sack.
1448474,deu,Leider begeistern Gedichte kein großes Publikum.
1585239,deu,"Lass mich dir das geben, bevor ich es vergesse."
2917711,deu,"Ich habe dir bereits milliardenmal gesagt, dass du dich von deinem Drang zur Übertreibung freimachen sollst."
1763882,deu,"Es ist nicht empfehlenswert, diese bereits geringen Mittel weiter auf untergeordnete Zielsetzungen aufzusplittern."
6678820,deu,Ich habe auch so eins.
2911646,deu,"Der Zimmer sind in diesem Hotel nicht sehr viele vorhanden, doch sind sie im Stile verschiedener Kunstepochen ausgestattet, und daher kann man das Zimmerangebot ohne Zweifel vielfältig nennen."
3010336,deu,Das hast du bestimmt schon vielen Mädchen gesagt.
1187194,deu,Tom hat die Küche noch nicht sauber gemacht.
481825,deu,Meine rechte Schulter schmerzt.
2366257,deu,"Wird er ertappt, so muss er siebenfach bezahlen."
5173438,deu,Sie wird Englisch lernen?
1177810,deu,Besorg auf dem Rückweg Tofu.
5465157,deu,Tom ist fast das ganze Jahr über auf Reisen. Um sein Haus kümmert sich während seiner Abwesenheit seine Schwester Maria.
4877533,deu,Sie haben Strip Poker gespielt.
2351379,deu,"Sie bringt mich oft durch Scherze in Verlegenheit, nach denen ich mir nie sicher bin, wie ich reagieren soll."
6642295,deu,Tom tut das vielleicht nicht.
3925780,deu,Wie alt bist du übrigens?
4091660,deu,"Es ist nicht die Hitze, es ist die Feuchtigkeit!"
2089130,deu,Maria lernt gerade in ihrem Zimmer.
4229523,deu,Du musst dich auf deine Stärken besinnen.
7008063,deu,Ist das amerikanische Englisch zur Verkehrssprache Europas geworden?
1020670,deu,"Ich war enttäuscht, als ich erfuhr, dass ihr nicht kommen konntet."
7686753,deu,Er spricht immer schlecht über andere.
2233494,deu,Ist es ernst?
6624772,deu,Wofür mache ich das?
1773451,deu,Ich bin ein völliges Wrack.
683837,deu,"Diese Geschichte ist kurz genug, um in einer Stunde gelesen zu werden."
3081471,deu,"Ich werde mal schnell die Wäsche aufhängen, während du uns einen Kaffee machst."
2747703,deu,"Fern von den Menschen wachsen Grundsätze, unter ihnen Handlungen."
396415,deu,"Sie liebt Tom, nicht mich."
2127299,deu,"Die drohenden Überschwemmungen machten es notwendig, die Stadt zu evakuieren."
6618861,deu,Tom war nicht am Leben.
849062,deu,Wir kämpften für alle.
6865069,deu,Welche magst du lieber?
3557398,deu,Ich werde morgen mit Tom zusammen frühstücken.
1354118,deu,Er hat mich mit einer üblen Erkältung angesteckt.
7269472,deu,Tom und Maria bessuchten den Dogenpalast in Venedig.
6626207,deu,"Dieser ist für dich, Tom."
7005789,deu,Das ist eine von vorne befüllbare Waschmaschine.
4931983,deu,Zeig mir die Liste.
1249380,deu,Er wollte immer wieder die alte Leier anstimmen.
349978,deu,Nimm bitte ein paar Tage Urlaub.
6626073,deu,Geh nicht nach Boston.
1115367,deu,Wir müssen viele Schwierigkeiten überwinden.
2754292,deu,Sowohl Tom als auch ich haben an der heutigen Sitzung nicht teilgenommen.
5638558,deu,"Ich höre durch die Wand, was sie sprechen."
6041186,deu,"Die Zeit, in der das Laub den Boden bedeckt, mögen die Tiere besonders."
7636918,deu,Tom gewann eine Goldmedaille.
1684506,deu,"Nach reiflicher Überlegung habe ich mich entschieden, dieses Angebot nicht anzunehmen."
3133292,deu,"Es ist ein kleiner Ort, wo es gut schmeckt."
2156231,deu,"Wer eine Rede hält, ohne auf die Reaktionen der Zuhörer zu achten, wird sie einschläfern."
2010830,deu,"Sie sind töricht, so etwas zu sagen."
4986491,deu,Die Post in diesem Land ist nicht schnell.
612757,deu,Lass uns das Problem mit ihnen besprechen.
2513667,deu,"Ich habe versucht, meine Pflicht zu tun."
6718539,deu,Was genau schlagen Sie vor?
2709881,deu,Dies geschieht bereits seit Jahren.
7409783,deu,"Ich kann nicht zur Feier kommen, weil ich niemanden habe, der auf das Kind aufpasst."
3520054,deu,Seine Pläne erscheinen utopisch.
566477,deu,Sie ist sehr unbekümmert.
1812027,deu,Wir sammeln Sätze und deren Übersetzungen in andere Sprachen.
5159049,deu,Sie sprechen wie ein weißer Chauvinist.
2701134,deu,"Er möge den Brief per Einschreiben senden, um sicher zu sein, dass er ans Ziel gelangt."

2671098,deu,Das meine ich nicht.

1879993,deu,Kann ich Sie kurz sprechen?
2830274,deu,Magst du gern reiten?

3500669,deu,Erkälte dich nicht!
401112,deu,Er war dankbar für deine Hilfe.
4258777,deu,"Stimmt es, dass Tom nach Boston fährt?"

6626164,deu,Du musst das nicht für mich tun.
1925140,deu,Du solltest dieses Fleisch nicht essen. Das riecht nicht gut.

2127892,deu,Du hast viel Talent. Du bist ein wahres Wunderkind!
4925135,deu,Nach der Ansage wählen Sie bitte die Zwei.

748683,deu,Gerade ist ein Unfall passiert.
7070959,deu,Darf ich Sie küssen?

5089165,deu,Die Demokratische Partei bedarf einer grundlegenden Reform.
7034431,deu,Maria kanzelt Tom ab.

2456678,deu,"Die Welt durch Vernunft dividiert, geht nicht auf."
7694232,deu,Ich spüre nichts als permanente Aggressivität und Verweigerung von dir.
3868948,deu,Wie läuft's so in letzter Zeit?
7469538,deu,"Tom und Maria sagten Johannes, sie seien deprimiert."
5068622,deu,Er verpasst praktisch niemals einen Termin.

1435705,deu,Ein Flutschwall unzusammenhängender Sätze entströmte ihrem Mund.
1953212,deu,Ich bin doch nicht bescheuert!
2977730,deu,"Ihr sagtet, Tom sei nicht beschäftigt."
3034314,deu,Tom bat Maria um Entschuldigung.
5868355,deu,"Sie können Tom sagen, dass er sich keine Sorgen zu machen braucht."

1328517,deu,"Sie wissen, dass es ein Sohn sein wird, was ich nicht weiß, obwohl ich der Vater bin; sie zweifeln, ob ich es lieben werde, obwohl leicht zu erraten ist, dass ich es lieben würde, selbst wenn es eine Tochter sein würde."
3148492,deu,Er interessiert sich für den Buddhismus.
3834513,deu,"Du musst versuchen, dich zu entspannen."
2775327,deu,Die zentrale Frage lautet: „Wie wollen und wie können wir künftig leben?“
6692328,deu,Wo ist die Schubkarre?
1274085,deu,"Da sind zwei Häuser. Das erste ist hoch, das andere ist niedrig."
1090254,deu,Sie kauft noch immer Milch.

4293421,deu,Heißt er nicht Tom?
1248915,deu,"Ich habe es nicht gern, wenn Arbeit und Freizeit vermischt werden."

5309230,deu,"Maria war das reichste, klügste und hübscheste Mädchen an der Schule; Tom dagegen lebte in den ärmlichsten Verhältnissen, bekam schlechte Noten und sah auch nicht besonders gut aus."
5711476,deu,"Ich werde dir sagen, was das ist."
3626043,deu,Das dürfen Sie nie vergessen!

7636041,deu,Tom saß auf dem Bett.
5928775,deu,"Bitte sag mir, dass du das nicht ernst meinst."
3107125,deu,Welcher Aktionsfilm ist dein Favorit?
4171243,deu,Was starrst du Maria die ganze Zeit an?

6643347,deu,Kennst du Tom nicht?
3615747,deu,Diese gallopierende Inflation hält jetzt schon seit drei Jahren an. Die Menschen sind frustriert und wütend.
1514954,deu,Seien Sie bitte behutsam.
6619188,deu,Tom ist sehr gepflegt.
2157183,deu,Ich bin up to date.
3380185,deu,Sie hat vermutlich noch etwas gegessen.
2720926,deu,"Ich weiß, dass du mit Tom reden willst."
1085,deu,"Ich wusste, dass es Plastik war, aber es schmeckte wie Holz."
4703263,deu,Hast du für morgen etwas geplant?
4668692,deu,Für deine Beleidigungen wirst du mir bezahlen.
1842088,deu,"Er war gerade beim Mittagessen, als ich das Zimmer betrat."
4259925,deu,Sie müssen Tom die Wahrheit sagen.
5345696,deu,"Ja, wir haben unsere Kalkulation korrigiert, tatsächlich wird es viel kälter werden als gewöhnlich."
2728089,deu,"Du musst wissen, dass „Delfinschwimmen“ ein Synonym von „Schmetterlingsschwimmen“ ist."
4730991,deu,Du musst nur den Knopf drücken.
1935252,deu,Er war sehr beharrlich.
2938891,deu,Sie haben die Frage nie beantwortet.
911828,deu,"Sie sind sich so ähnlich, dass ich sie nie auseinanderhalten kann."
2153110,deu,"Ich muss mit Tom über das sprechen, was er, wie er sagte, vorhabe."
7530371,deu,"Maria wirkte sehr überrascht, als ich ihr davon erzählte."
2779503,deu,Senden Sie mir meine Post bitte über die Tōkyōter Büroanschrift meines Vaters zu!
2967309,deu,Hatte Tom Feinde?
414270,deu,"Mein Vater liebt es, in der Garage zu werkeln."

424738,deu,Zu dieser Zeit war ich Student.

691771,deu,"Es hat gerade acht Uhr geschlagen, nicht wahr?"
5516332,deu,"Lachen, Weinen, Lust und Schmerz sind Geschwisterkinder."
2046057,deu,Er steckt den Kopf in den Sand wie ein Strauß.
4046122,deu,„Was ist das?“ – „Das ist ein Pfirsich.“
5798411,deu,Dieser Film gefällt mir nicht.

3066336,deu,Danke für den Verweis!
1770527,deu,Ohne Deine Hilfe hätte er es wohl nicht geschafft.
3663324,deu,"Fröhliche Weihnachten, Tatoeba!"
1985544,deu,"Sie posierte, wobei sie eine Rose in der Hand hielt."
6047997,deu,Wir haben ein Taxi genommen.
6619453,deu,Tom fuhr weiter.
4644615,deu,Sie gingen drei Meilen weiter.
2818874,deu,Geister können von Menschen Besitz ergreifen.
2351992,deu,Erinnerst du dich nicht an meinen Namen?
3169789,deu,"Wenn Tom das gesagt hat, stimmt es wahrscheinlich."
2905269,deu,Hast Du vielleicht ein Bild von ihm?
2363105,deu,Der rote Gürtel lässt ihr rotes Kleid noch besser aussehen.
1405548,deu,Er zeichnet sich in vielen Sportarten aus.
6929278,deu,Tom hat in seinem Garten einen Hühnerstall gebaut.
4784190,deu,"Bist du dir sicher, dass dieses Ding ungefährich ist?"
3076502,deu,Es duftete in der Küche nach Kaffee und frisch gebackenen Brötchen.
6463225,deu,Nach der Arbeit bin ich mit Tom ins Kino gegangen.
442474,deu,Nach dem Tod ihres Ehemanns zog sie die beiden Kinder ganz alleine auf.
3890710,deu,Man kann aus dem Herzen die Liebe nicht so einfach entfernen wie einen Zahn ziehen.
1721650,deu,Es ist heute außerordentlich heiß.
6714731,deu,Wir sprachen unter anderem übers Wetter.
1953538,deu,"Tom kann nicht umhin, eifersüchtig zu sein."
1006024,deu,Ihr geht es dank der ärztlichen Behandlung viel besser.
4279452,deu,Tom besuchte eine Schule für Jungen.
1839278,deu,Die Piraten enterten das Handelsschiff.
5254388,deu,"Tom sagte, Maria sei unkooperativ."
3710732,deu,Wer wird die Speisen zubereiten?
1982406,deu,"Hätte jeder das Seine, so wärst du so arm wie ein andrer."
3242711,deu,Alle anwesenden Personen waren überrascht.
2725853,deu,Die Hunde in der Siedlung machen alle einen großen Bogen um Marias Katze.
4879899,deu,"Sagt er mir, was ich tun soll?"
6709824,deu,"Wir leben alle unter der gleichen Sonne, aber wir haben nicht den gleichen Horizont."
7460439,deu,Ich rechne nicht mit Toms Hilfe.
2040131,deu,Gleich nach dem Heizen war der Ofen heiß.
1295912,deu,"Wenn der Mensch so viel Vernunft hätte wie Verstand, wäre alles viel einfacher."
6645538,deu,"Das ist, was ich tun möchte."

767953,deu,Der Mann hat Brot gegessen.
7267555,deu,Seine Masche wäre fast aufgegangen.
6614844,deu,Tom wurde erregt.
1401115,deu,Alte Leute gehen langsam.
5637689,deu,Ich war während der ganzen Sommerferien nicht zu Hause.
432557,deu,Über Geschmack kann man nicht streiten.
3420856,deu,Jetzt haben wir viel Zeit.
4325255,deu,Amys Geburtstag ist im Oktober.
518322,deu,"Gott sei Dank, es ist Freitag!"
6556475,deu,Tom hatte Schuld an dem Unfall.
1967914,deu,Ich sehe von hier aus nichts.
1258342,deu,"Dichtung ist eine hochgradig abstrakte Angelegenheit, und deshalb fürchten wir mit Recht um ihre Zukunft in einer Welt, die beherrscht wird von Bildern, welche die Wirklichkeit auf analoge Weise spiegeln."

5426513,deu,Warum ist sie nicht zu Tom gegangen?
6999068,deu,So kann man es auch machen.
4007404,deu,Tom widersprach sich.
7001931,deu,Gegen mich selbst bin ich immer strenger als gegen andere.

1996644,deu,Ich kenne keinen mit diesem Namen.
3320646,deu,Trinkt ihr Alkohol?
1545483,deu,Sie ist von Geburt an stumm.
1207980,deu,Ich nahm all meinen Mut zusammen und ging hin.
6643965,deu,"Ich sagte, ich werde darüber nachdenken."
5210987,deu,"Hüte dich vor jenen Katzen, die vorne zärtlich tun und hinten kratzen."
3026344,deu,Vielen Dank im Voraus und viele Grüße!
432139,deu,Du solltest hier lieber nicht alleine spazieren gehen.
6624799,deu,"Wir werden tun, was wir tun müssen."
757443,deu,Zwei Jungen fehlen heute in der Schule.
1938313,deu,Tom irrt sich.
3002789,deu,Es gibt keine Grenze der Nachsicht mit sich selbst.
3766897,deu,Dieses Foto wurde vor drei Jahren in Boston aufgenommen.
5896884,deu,Toms Bruder ist älter als meiner.
373078,deu,"Liest sie ein Buch? ""Ja."""
1234369,deu,"Er pfiff eine Melodie, um die Dunkelheit nicht zu fürchten."
7664899,deu,"Maria ist deine ältere Schwester, nicht wahr?"
7448562,deu,Tom war Lehrer.
5992040,deu,Mein Bruder ist außer Haus.
3531913,deu,Tom hat seine Kinder zum Park gebracht.
7340508,deu,Du bist ein 08/15-Typ.
498041,deu,Der Gemüsehändler ist sehr freundlich zu seinen Kunden.
2282859,deu,Werfe Ballast ab!
2493978,deu,Ich will heute nicht lernen.
6786957,deu,"Tom wusste nicht, dass Marie ihn liebt."
1823413,deu,"Es glänzt die laue Mondennacht, die alten Giebel ragen; das Bündel ist zurechtgemacht, am Tore steht der Wagen."
2216264,deu,Korrelation bedeutet nicht Kausalität.
1328308,deu,"Da gerade keine Regenzeit ist, braucht man keinen Regenschirm."
3013051,deu,Tom deutete auf etwas auf der anderen Straßenseite.
2608182,deu,Tom und Maria sind oft zusammen.
3311875,deu,"Wenn ich will, dann kann ich, aber ich will nicht."
659150,deu,"Eine freche Antwort, gerichtet an einen Anderen, ist ein guter Witz."
361563,deu,Das klingt wirklich interessant.
2529384,deu,Ich gehe lieber alleine.
1911230,deu,Boston ist in den letzten zehn Jahren rasch gewachsen.
782520,deu,Wir werden an einer Partie Tennis teilnehmen.
4769968,deu,Ich verletze niemanden.
1619961,deu,Japaner sind allgemein zurückhaltend.
1103456,deu,Das Mädchen hat leider fast nichts zu essen.
3448320,deu,Tom scheint ein sehr fähiger Mann zu sein.
7448542,deu,"Ich hoffe, Tom ist unparteiisch."
683964,deu,Ich habe Astigmatismus.
4136229,deu,"Tom hat zugesagt, Maria bei der Jobsuche zu helfen."
2377138,deu,Maria trug ihren Sohn auf dem Rücken.
7523443,deu,In der Früh war das Wasser gefroren.
6875459,deu,"Warum hast du dich denn sogar vor mir versteckt, Schatz?"
5435808,deu,Warum habe ich ständig Hunger?
341957,deu,"Ich verstehe nicht, warum er nicht die Wahrheit gesagt hat."
923552,deu,Die Bestrafung sollte im Verhältnis zum Verbrechen stehen.
7302852,deu,Tom schlachtete zum Kauf eines Hauses sein Sparschwein.
3388873,deu,Um halb drei wecke mich bitte jemand!
1956651,deu,Ich habe Tom gerade erst getroffen.
1721501,deu,Die Kinder haben sich beim Eisessen schmutzig gemacht.
678019,deu,Taten zählen mehr als Worte.
6636080,deu,Können Sie mir bitte einen Platz freihalten?
6770060,deu,Ich habe oft Halsschmerzen.
6373927,deu,"Lass die Kreditkarte zu Hause, wir müssen sparen!"
3759664,deu,"Der alte Dichter setzte sich wieder neben seinen Ofen und nahm den kleinen Jungen auf den Schoß; er wrang das Wasser aus seinem triefenden Haar, wärmte die Hände des Kindes in seinen eigenen und gab ihm Glühwein zu trinken."
3295401,deu,Er scheint ein ehrlicher Mann zu sein.
4389337,deu,"Es tut mir leid, aber ich muss dich stören."
5133552,deu,Der frühe Vogel kann mich mal!
2263590,deu,Mach mal Ferien — im Esperanto-Land!
3014325,deu,Ich habe viel Blut verloren.
1500291,deu,Tom kann das erledigen.
547243,deu,Nancy spielt kein Tennis.
591017,deu,"Es ist das beste Buch, das ich je gelesen habe."
6625135,deu,Tom wird mich vermissen.
6198789,deu,Wahre Schönheit kommt von innen.
2659912,deu,Tu mir das nicht an!
1008626,deu,Wie groß sind die Spieler im Schnitt?
1808141,deu,"Ich habe gehört, dass Tom genauso gut kochen kann wie seine Frau, wenn nicht noch besser."
4069167,deu,Sie ließ ihren Tränen freien Lauf.
3136764,deu,"Sie brannten darauf, zu erfahren, was geschehen war."
1861742,deu,"Ich wäre dir dankbar, wenn du bis morgen bliebest."
2188497,deu,"Gibt es eine Eigenschaft der menschlichen Natur, die man nicht erwerben kann, die angeboren sein muss, so ist es die Dummheit."

5912447,deu,Hast du Tom erschossen?
1292642,deu,Das Land wurde von einem französischen Adelsgeschlecht regiert.
1331442,deu,"Was für eine Vorstellung haben wir von Europa, von dem Europa, als dessen Bewohner wir uns gemeinsam fühlen sollen, das wir bewahren und verbessern wollen?"
1234853,deu,Tom kennt nicht den Unterschied zwischen Verteidigung und Angriff.
2299159,deu,"Ich denke, wir sollten eine Pause machen."
3922243,deu,Warum haben Sie sich der Stimme enthalten?
7365496,deu,Tom machte einen angewiderten Eindruck.
2128553,deu,Sind Sie Buddhist?
1856396,deu,Es steht eins zu eins.
3559189,deu,Der Wind riss die Fahne in Fetzen.
3840043,deu,So einfach ist es nie.
935564,deu,Ich bin beim Hausaufgaben machen eingeschlafen.
7141501,deu,Ich habe abgesagt.
7554246,deu,Tom übersetzt zu wörtlich.
1329745,deu,"Ich habe immer wieder in seinem Büro angerufen, aber keiner antwortete."
1816617,deu,Was ist mit deinem Auto los?
927861,deu,Ein glücklicher Zufall hat uns wieder zusammengeführt.
2970289,deu,Ich werde Klartext reden.
2945783,deu,Es gibt zwei Kühe im Dorf.
5853912,deu,"Ich empfehle dir, du solltest nichts zu der Angelegenheit sagen."
6667753,deu,Ich war der Adressat dieses Pakets.
342521,deu,"Wenn es regnet, nimmt sie den Bus."
2485368,deu,"Schicksal, das wusste er jetzt, kam nicht von irgendwoher, es wuchs im eigenen Innern."
3179324,deu,"Ich gehe hin, wo auch immer du willst."
2315589,deu,Ich bin nicht so wie du!
6624820,deu,Wir müssen das haben.
1947931,deu,"Wieso stimmte ich zu, diesen Brief zu schreiben?"
2581082,deu,Wäge deine Worte! Jedes könnte das letzte sein.
2150634,deu,Die Schildkröte genießt den Weg mehr als der Hase.
5179460,deu,Es war noch dort.
7469397,deu,"Tom und Maria sagten Johannes, dass sie vorbereitet seien."
2498433,deu,Eine halbe Stunde verging.
792451,deu,Endlich fand ich die Antwort auf meine Frage.
2991362,deu,Tom hat für mich einen Französischlehrer ausfindig gemacht.
2832167,deu,"Ich wusste, was passiert war."
7374109,deu,Alle warten.
2177329,deu,Hast du die aktuelle Version?
913829,deu,Was möchten Sie während Ihres Aufenthalts machen?
5992250,deu,Ich muss noch mehr lernen.
1058718,deu,Du kannst hier nicht schwimmen.
3663363,deu,"Jetzt will ich schnell funktionsfähig werden, verstehen Sie?"
526272,deu,Ich bin den ganzen Tag zu Hause geblieben.
7535349,deu,"Maria hat gesagt, dass sie arbeitslos sei."
773923,deu,Es ist neun Minuten nach zehn.
1726930,deu,Er hatte nichts Böses im Sinn.
809723,deu,Ich bin Ausländer.
5547444,deu,Sie wollte sofort heiraten.
3660284,deu,"Es geht nichts über ein gutes Butterbrot, aber mit einem Rädchen Wurst schmeckt es noch besser."
1551028,deu,Ich heiße Luis.
6381264,deu,Maria holt Tom am Bahnhof ab.
6645621,deu,"Das ist dein Zuhause, Tom."
2980090,deu,Waren Sterne am Himmel?
363426,deu,Ich möchte viel mehr.
5145146,deu,"Ich bin mir sicher, dass Tom euch sehr gerne sehen würde."
2718444,deu,"Maria ist immer bereit, hehre Ziele zu verteidigen."
6117790,deu,"Das Rasieren war keine einfache Aufgabe, denn seine Hand zitterte weiterhin stark; und das Rasieren erfordert Aufmerksamkeit, selbst dann, wenn man nicht dabei tanzt."
3815337,deu,Wieso beschäftigt dich das so?
1916304,deu,"Mein Benzin ist fast aus und ich wollte schnell die nächste Tankstelle erreichen, damit ich nicht mitten auf der Straße liegen bleibe und den Verkehr behindere."
2192605,deu,Ich kenne sie nicht besonders gut.
7727685,deu,Tom musste spät arbeiten.
2305605,deu,Das sollte egal sein.
1092,deu,"Die zweite Hälfte des Lebens eines Menschen besteht nur aus den Gewohnheiten, die er sich während der ersten Hälfte angeeignet hat."
6152721,deu,"Er fragte mich, ob er mir eine Frage stellen dürfe."
4918891,deu,Die italienische und die spanische Kultur beeinflussten die österreichische Kultur.
4461904,deu,Möchtet ihr noch etwas Tee?
369174,deu,Ich mag französisches Essen sehr gerne.
6003647,deu,"„Entschuldige, Tom!“ – „Entschuldige dich bei Maria! Auf die werden jetzt alle mit dem Finger zeigen. So eine Blamage!“"
639737,deu,"Warum fragst du, wenn du alles weißt?"
7006611,deu,"Ihr Vorgesetzter schränkt Ihre Möglichkeit ein, sich zu äußern."
2072683,deu,"Sie sind graduell unterschiedlich, aber nicht in ihrem Wesen."
2727829,deu,Sowohl der Junge als auch das Mädchen sind gewitzt.
5070900,deu,Ist das nicht irgendwie eh klar?
1987968,deu,"Er begab sich zum Baumarkt, um sich eine Schaufel zu besorgen."
7534762,deu,"Du hast so geschnarcht, dass ich neben dir nicht schlafen konnte."
2238151,deu,Willst du mit mir verreisen?
509,deu,Wie bist du auf diese verrückte Idee gekommen?
747732,deu,Ich habe das Buch gestern Abend gelesen.
1527982,deu,Ich bin seit 15 Jahren Lehrer.
3608717,deu,Nun mach schon!
1420886,deu,Was wirst du damit machen?
2311953,deu,"Der Leib ist schon satt, doch noch hungern die Augen."
366351,deu,Jeder Bus ist voll.
2650595,deu,Wir sind zwei Stunden umgegangen.
7046693,deu,"Wir wissen, dass ihr Deutsch lernt."
5133459,deu,"Tom weiß nicht, wie Leitungswasser schmeckt – er trinkt immer nur Mineralwasser."
5341646,deu,Ihr würdet nicht zustimmen.
4867007,deu,Sein Namensfest war der St. Antoniustag.
399523,deu,"Er war extrem beschäftigt, sodass er nicht selbst ging, sondern seinen Sohn schickte."
399132,deu,Ich mache jeden zweiten Tag einen Spaziergang.
2221151,deu,Pfeiffersches Drüsenfieber ist auch als die „Kusskrankheit“ bekannt.
1894857,deu,"In Kanada, spricht man Englisch und Französisch."
4960700,deu,"Über das Gehörte kannst du reden, über das Gesehene nicht."
7428046,deu,"Du bist doch Französischlehrer, oder?"
3406730,deu,"Ich hätte nicht gedacht, Sie so bald wiederzusehen."
6586970,deu,"Tom legte sich hinter dem Sofa auf die Lauer, denn er wollte das Christkind dabei sehen, wie es die Geschenke brachte."
2369795,deu,Er hat uns die Wahrheit vorenthalten.
357144,deu,"Ich frage mich, wer dieses Mädchen ist."
2767925,deu,"Weißt du, welchen Spitznamen Tom als Kind hatte?"
1743730,deu,Lass ihn nicht die Lampe anschalten!
3383378,deu,Ihr müsst mich euch helfen lassen.
2803277,deu,"Man kann die Welt nur nach dem verstehen, was man erlebt."
2901788,deu,"Ich bitte Sie, langsamer zu sprechen."
3199605,deu,Er bewunderte Toms Courage.
1970016,deu,"Er fragt den Wirt, ob er einen guten Wein hat."
6006542,deu,Er sieht dich an. Kennst du ihn?
7558622,deu,"Schau mal, wie exakt Tom gearbeitet hat. Das solltest du dir zum Vorbild nehmen."
7058317,deu,Du bist ein Nichtsnutz!
2831109,deu,"Wer niemanden gerettet hat, hat sich keine Feinde gemacht."
4302202,deu,Du hättest es selbst tun sollen.
2492200,deu,Ich sehe wie Tom aus.
2481282,deu,"Du hast zugesagt, ergo musst du kommen."
526276,deu,Nächstes Jahr werde ich siebzehn.
4486589,deu,Sie beobachteten mich schweigend.
5750440,deu,Dann sollten wir uns unbedingt sehen.
1784396,deu,"Zu fällen einen schönen Baum, braucht's eine halbe Stunde kaum. Zu wachsen, bis man ihn bewundert, braucht er, bedenk' es, ein Jahrhundert."
941203,deu,"Wenn du es verstehst, dann mach es bitte ordentlich."
600797,deu,Berlusconi ist scheiße.
7548815,deu,Beim Anblick des frischen Hummers bekam ich Appetit.
771030,deu,"Das Publikum bemerkte, dass der Redner müde aussah."
1963908,deu,Ist Tom noch immer Kapitän eures Schiffes?
2909479,deu,Das haben wir elegant gelöst.
1785603,deu,"Weißt du, was ein Schamane geträumt hat?"
2711109,deu,Das Lämpchen leuchtet bereits seit einigen Minuten.
2872271,deu,Man muss seine Heimat lieben.
1985414,deu,"Wie geplant, arbeitete ich binnen zehn Tagen den gesamten Kurs durch, der eine vollständige Sprachlehre und einen ziemlich umfänglichen Wortschatz umfasste, so dass ich alsbald fähig war, einen einfachen Artikel zu verfassen."
2344126,deu,Nehmen Sie den Apfel und halbieren Sie ihn!
2383932,deu,Tom gibt nicht auf.
691683,deu,Ich bin niemals in Amerika gewesen.
782762,deu,"Er kann es sich nicht leisten, ein neues Auto zu kaufen."
3183683,deu,Könnte ich draußen mit Ihnen sprechen?
5585156,deu,Ich habe Tom nur beim Wort genommen.
5116993,deu,Er hat damit keinen Erfolg.
2727779,deu,Ich gratuliere dir zum Bestehen der Prüfung!
1450485,deu,"Lasst uns verhindern, dass das auch anderen Familien passiert."
1188536,deu,Er ist nach London über Paris geflogen.
2061435,deu,"Soziale Netze haben uns dichter vernetzt denn je zuvor. Doch neue Untersuchungen zeigen, dass wir nie zuvor einsamer waren und dass uns diese Einsamkeit psychisch und physisch krank macht."
1718795,deu,"Ich habe einen Alternativsatz hinzugefügt und ihn mit dem Etikett ""veraltet"" versehen. Was verlangst du noch von mir, mein Blut?"
1944795,deu,Er hat einen perfekten Körper.
6218362,deu,Ich will ihnen einen Brief schicken.
368523,deu,Der Aufstand wurde niedergeschlagen.
7636412,deu,Tom ist schon ein kleiner Feigling.
2221660,deu,Wir liefen ungefähr fünf Meilen.
5497476,deu,Tom ist zu beschäftigt und kann Sie im Augenblick nicht empfangen.
967294,deu,"Ich aber bin davon überzeugt, dass wir, wenn wir weiterkommen wollen, die Dinge, die uns auf der Seele brennen und die oftmals nur hinter verschlossenen Türen gesagt werden, offen aussprechen sollten."
1561521,deu,Das Schiff änderte seinen Kurs.
2145057,deu,"Die alte Dame war so freundlich, mir den Weg zum Bahnhof zu weisen."
3074905,deu,"Es gibt nichts, was dieses Ding nicht essen kann."
1817343,deu,"Wenn ich meinen Namen ändere, um rassistische Kommentare zu vermeiden, warum soll ich dann nicht auch meine Hautfarbe ändern?"
2080682,deu,Sonntags ist das Museum nicht geöffnet.
7567847,deu,"Ich glaube, ich bin objektiv."
362772,deu,Willkommen!
5750123,deu,"In Ordnung, ich sage es ihr."
3281284,deu,Es gab keine echten Beweise gegen Tom.
6766203,deu,Er starb kurz nach seinem Unfall.
2268860,deu,"Trotzdem bedarf es immer noch einer wissenschaftlichen Erklärung dafür, wie genau Schmerzen durch Hirnprozesse verursacht werden."
1851592,deu,Nun machen Sie schon weiter!
935934,deu,Dein Wagemut erstaunt mich.
4081490,deu,Hat Tom studiert?
4222707,deu,„Guten Morgen! Es liegt Schnee!“ – „Ernsthaft?“
359067,deu,Ich habe ihn schwimmen sehen.
2423664,deu,"Nur der Denkende erlebt sein Leben, an Gedankenlosen zieht es vorbei."
7261063,deu,Um die Dekoration hat sich überwiegend Maria gekümmert.
3753591,deu,Er gewann einen beträchtlichen Geldbetrag.
1044276,deu,"Es ist mir egal, wenn es schneit."
3059573,deu,Du setztest dieses Mal unser Leben aufs Spiel.
596457,deu,In der Schweiz erhält nur etwa jeder zehnte Student ein Stipendium.
2293645,deu,Das Langschwert steckte in einer exquisit gravierten Scheide.
5445022,deu,Tom arbeitete wie ein Besessener.
548966,deu,"Er ist gegangen und ich weiß weder, warum, noch, ob er zurückkommen wird."
2661139,deu,"Tom trägt keine Brille, trug früher aber mal eine."
2042240,deu,"Du darfst das Museum von außen fotografieren, aber nicht die Ausstellungsstücke im Inneren."
2748583,deu,"Bestimme das Volumen des größten geraden Kreiskegels, der sich einer Kugel vom Radius 𝑟 einbeschreiben lässt."
1438871,deu,"Es kostete viel Geld, das Auto zu reparieren."
1820003,deu,Ich habe ihm mein Auto zur Verfügung gestellt.
6562265,deu,Die Kinder bauten sich ein Baumhaus.
5214865,deu,"Ich finde, dass Tom große Ähnlichkeit mit Johannes hat."
1335181,deu,"Bei Erfolgen demütig bleiben, ist ein christlicher Schatz."
2049899,deu,Ich brauche Toms Moneten.
5488217,deu,Ich habe noch keine Entscheidung getroffen.
5931796,deu,Sie können nicht gewinnen.
1546977,deu,Für Schlager interessiere ich mich so gut wie gar nicht.
4090703,deu,Tom hat mir endlich verziehen.
2356901,deu,Es ist Stoßzeit.
688294,deu,Neben dem Tisch war nur ein Stuhl.

3290032,ita,Siete stupendi.
3053617,ita,Sono contento che stia bene.
1280537,ita,"Siediti, per piacere."
7702534,ita,"Le persone qua sono esigenti riguardo a quello che mangiano, quindi anche se un ristorante è poco costoso, chiuderà presto i battenti se il cibo non ha un buon sapore."
5525196,ita,Penso che stiate facendo un ottimo lavoro.
1032541,ita,Questa cosa viola all'incirca un milione di codici penali e tutti i libri sacri esistenti.

1179799,ita,Dovreste provare ad essere di più come Tom.
3432074,ita,Sembra una frase intelligente.
5692779,ita,Ora sai come mi sento.

5767300,ita,Buona fortuna per il vostro esame.
1563059,ita,Hai preso il cellulare nuovo?
3553668,ita,Abbiamo mangiato benissimo!
1725768,ita,Non andiamo più in quel ristorante.
5201954,ita,Liberland è una micronazione.
7725665,ita,Tom riesce a camminare soltanto se ha il suo bastone.
5387459,ita,Sembra patetico.
3166951,ita,Tra un po' io mi tolgo da Facebook.
3533085,ita,Il comizio deve iniziare il prima possibile.
4507049,ita,Farai qualcosa a questo proposito?
6569395,ita,Perché non mi dice cosa vuole per Natale?
2703737,ita,Io non vi capisco per niente.
6146611,ita,Tom pensa di saper parlare in francese meglio di Mary.
3137758,ita,Senza la tua assistenza avrei fallito.
3053307,ita,Ho sentito dire che Boston è un posto pericoloso. È vero?

3500365,ita,C'è uno statuto.
2289889,ita,Sai chi canta quella canzone?
6750837,ita,"Di che nazionalità erano i loro nonni? ""Maltese."""
5202130,ita,Io non voglio sembrare un turista.
2018222,ita,Io sono un po' impegnato.
3344901,ita,"Lì non può sedersi, è il posto per le persone con disabilità."
1083184,ita,Sulla foto si vedeva una casa.
2554635,ita,Io ero forte.
5399969,ita,"Certo, ti perdono."

3246975,ita,Io devo tornare al mio ufficio.
3007177,ita,Era un sì?
3711194,ita,Lui inventò una scusa.
4887525,ita,Ti sei lavato le mani dopo aver cagato?
6929519,ita,Non tutto quello che ha detto Tom era vero.
3292034,ita,È un servizio da evitare?
6719420,ita,Tom ha deciso di rallentare.
4710199,ita,Io sto seriamente pensando di trasferirmi a Boston.
3700602,ita,Lei è originale.
4607754,ita,"Fermandosi ai portali e alle agenzie interinali, si visualizza solamente un bacino molto ridotto di offerte."
4213247,ita,Come ti senti riguardo a lei?
1250473,ita,Sono un panettiere.
5796782,ita,Era la tua domanda?
5225453,ita,Io penso che sia ancora presto per festeggiare.
4389870,ita,Piantala di frignare.
2465813,ita,"Che sollievo, mi sento quasi in estate."
6790802,ita,Entra in casa.
5772913,ita,Li ho conosciuti questa sera.
1003087,ita,Ho letto il libro.
3513957,ita,Io mi chiedo dove possa essere andato Tom.
3485653,ita,Sempre tua sorella ce l'ha detto.
4503695,ita,I prigionieri sono svaniti.
3763892,ita,Pensano tutti che io sia strana.
3427098,ita,Non lo so quando si sono conosciuti Tom e Mary.
5990642,ita,Qual è il suo posto preferito in cui mangiare a Boston?
6612379,ita,Il mio migliore amico era americano.
6276195,ita,Le ho raccontato qualche barzelletta.
3407268,ita,Noi abbiamo meno di un'ora.
7608494,ita,Vado a fare affari in Svezia.
3437323,ita,Ora riprovate.
5191286,ita,Sanno tutti che non esiste qualcosa come una persona perfetta.
4331368,ita,Aspettai tre ore.
4511487,ita,"Se ci sono degli errori, correggeteli."
823460,ita,Lascerà presto l'ospedale.
4888294,ita,Noi amiamo quello che facciamo.
3412669,ita,Dovrei pulire la mia stanza.
3143081,ita,Non la vedo dalle superiori.
3405725,ita,Tu non hai mai chiesto quello che volevo.
5756146,ita,Mi importa di loro.
1537544,ita,Il testo è troppo lungo.
4453645,ita,Sai che cos'è l'amore?
2454901,ita,Io scriverò una lettera a Judy.
4724090,ita,Non abbiamo alcun posto in cui nasconderci.
4366872,ita,Per quanto tempo devo aspettare?
4720518,ita,"Non sa parlare l'inglese, vero?"

2455964,ita,Era insolito.
1761539,ita,Tuo fratello ha la sua propria casa in Germania?
5453123,ita,Siete intelligente.
5290731,ita,Non andrò lì dentro da sola.
3408335,ita,Cosa significa questo?
4670223,ita,Tom non mi ha impressionata.
4978783,ita,Sono una giocatrice di scacchi piuttosto brava.
7528013,ita,Mangeranno le vostre banane.
4815206,ita,Ho visitato Nara.

6210495,ita,Non l'ho potuto proteggere.
3556878,ita,A quanto lo faresti?
373813,ita,"Abbiamo bisogno di fatti, non di parole."
3026743,ita,"Se non conosci la parola esatta, cerca di descriverne il significato."
5740511,ita,Tom non vuole ammettere la realtà.
3257821,ita,Un migliaio di persone erano lì.
4568510,ita,Siate calme.
740210,ita,Da dove venite?
5669831,ita,Solamente Tom è rimasto.
570558,ita,"Bel colpo, ragazzo. L'hai preso."

7034096,ita,È anoressica.
6290435,ita,Non dovrebbe farla entrare.
1993868,ita,Trovi gli omofoni.
1633213,ita,I cerchi rossi sulla piantina indicano le scuole.
4590621,ita,È un tale ipocrita.

1087858,ita,Il Brasile è la mia patria.
4950524,ita,A Tom piace il cibo messicano.
4818107,ita,Tom uscì e lasciò la porta aperta.

7025941,ita,Non mi aspetto alcun trattamento speciale.
3498963,ita,Complimenti per averla pubblicata!
4932330,ita,Dia un occhio alle mie valigie.
4620889,ita,Mi piace la libertà.
3508965,ita,Questo cellulare costa una fortuna.
1506896,ita,Dev'essere vera.
6069730,ita,Dove posso imparare l'esperanto?
3358109,ita,Ho pensato che Tom potrebbe essere interessato ad aiutare.
5019550,ita,C'erano molti posti vuoti il giorno in cui sono andato.
6945789,ita,Ti sei alzata presto questa mattina?
4994122,ita,Ha chiesto di poterlo interrogare.
2720943,ita,Il nemico è indebolito!
6057267,ita,Tom ha una coda di cavallo?
4462220,ita,Non veniamo.
4715032,ita,Noi abbiamo una piscina.
5572297,ita,Lui quando è arrivato a Kyoto?

3412691,ita,Tutti quelli che lo conoscevano lo amavano.
772313,ita,Gli utenti di Tatoeba sono gentili.
5684345,ita,Vi chiamerò quando sono pronta.
2945321,ita,È davvero doloroso.
5796673,ita,Dica loro di smettere di preoccuparsi.
2170740,ita,"Dobbiamo restare qui, che lo si voglia o no."
3193356,ita,Io proverei a smettere.
4233658,ita,Marie metterà le lasagne in forno.
4576854,ita,Sono scappata da casa.
837813,ita,Lei si guadagna da vivere scrivendo.
7619218,ita,Vanno a costruire biblioteche in Paraguay.
1082104,ita,Guida con prudenza.
5547610,ita,Desiderate lasciare un messaggio?
6450368,ita,Perché Tom è così emozionato?
7135127,ita,Non essere scocciante!
7253009,ita,Io ho dei ricordi.
1992542,ita,La gente è sotto pressione.
7071366,ita,Ho sposato la persona giusta?
2908312,ita,Abiti a Sasayama?
5248296,ita,Ti ringrazio per l'avvertimento.
6635113,ita,Voi pensate davvero che Tom e Mary siano al sicuro?
3963372,ita,Ormai sei tu il maestro!
4231945,ita,È un futuro medico.
7649131,ita,Questo preoccupa molto Tom.
6791737,ita,Il loro colore preferito è il nero.
6746020,ita,"Di che nazionalità sono i vostri amici? ""Malese."""
737440,ita,Va in biblioteca ogni altro giorno.
6843269,ita,Scrivo lettere ai miei amici.
3787398,ita,"Non è che siete idioti, siete complici."
7425220,ita,Per studio vanno in Canada?
5999087,ita,Tom mi strinse forte a sé.
3260236,ita,L'hanno lasciata sotto al tavolo.
5393808,ita,Vorrei non avervi mai chiesto di farlo.
3558384,ita,Nessun TG ne ha ancora parlato?
1299320,ita,È meglio che non lo contatti.
2468971,ita,"Lei è impegnata oggi, vero?"
4808600,ita,Le illusioni durano poco.
7622191,ita,Non vai a costruire fattorie in Romania.
5104083,ita,Sono una principiante.
3321284,ita,Tom non vuole bere alcunché.
6212044,ita,Puoi dirle di richiamare?
5542734,ita,Io non sono uno scienziato.
2305171,ita,Hai molte ore buche?
5565781,ita,I negozi hanno chiuso alle cinque.
4715904,ita,Come stanno le cose?
6839990,ita,Fai semplicemente finta che tutto sia normale.
2312320,ita,Come puoi essere in collera contro di lei?
7652619,ita,Non vai a costruire templi in Marocco.
6691830,ita,Io voglio essere un cestista famoso.
7568712,ita,"Dove andremo fra due settimane? ""In Perù."""
3288511,ita,È sano di mente?
934503,ita,Puoi venire alle 9?
2701389,ita,"Grazie, altrettanto!"
5605085,ita,Tutte le cose buone accadono quando meno te lo aspetti.
6858065,ita,Non penso che Tom debba lavorare oggi.
5797325,ita,Un giorno capirai tutto.
7014967,ita,Tom apparentemente ha vinto.
1021059,ita,A che ora inizia la scuola?
3922464,ita,Lui possiede un'automobile sportiva gialla.
5992578,ita,Perché l'ha licenziata?
5069758,ita,È una differenza molto grande.
2443412,ita,Io avrei dovuto finirla prima.
5579988,ita,Cosa vuoi comprargli?
3274888,ita,Votare è il vostro dovere civico.
7604042,ita,Non andiamo a fare soldi in Islanda del Nord.
5055706,ita,Mi ha guardata negli occhi.
7628313,ita,Non vai a costruire mausolei in Vietnam.
5731184,ita,Capisco questo correttamente?
7565054,ita,"Io la avvertii, però lei non ascoltò."
3528158,ita,Era entusiasta al suo dire così.
3852579,ita,Uso raramente le borse di plastica.
4387266,ita,Lei ha preparato il pranzo.
6874342,ita,Tom ha detto che Mary non gli avrebbe permesso di farlo.
6068533,ita,Non andai con lui.
3491039,ita,Io spero che questo renderà più facile ottenere una comprensione del significato e memorizzare le parole appena apprese.
3397939,ita,Qualcuno era indisposto?
3117414,ita,Si possono applicare delle etichette alle produzioni letterarie.
6747488,ita,"Di che nazionalità sono le tue madri? ""Malese."""
3353600,ita,"Non è perché si ha un titolo che si è un nobile. Ci sono persone che hanno una nobiltà naturale e sono nobili fini. Le persone come noi che hanno solo titoli nobiliari non sono nobili, siamo più come i contadini."
1700852,ita,A me piacerebbe parlare l'inglese fluentemente.
5776296,ita,La riunione si tiene oggi o domani?
2436804,ita,Voi mangiate gli spaghetti arrotolandoli con la forchetta?
3808297,ita,Lei si inclinò.
6755483,ita,"Di che nazionalità erano i loro pazienti? ""Argentina."""
7049701,ita,"Tom mi sta aspettando, vero?"
5123945,ita,Lei voleva avere una famiglia con lui.
3872540,ita,Li avevano invitati per disutere della Grecia e della crisi?
3218235,ita,Esco da scuola.
5431389,ita,Io non le riempio.
7609069,ita,Non andate a fare affari in Irlanda.
2822766,ita,Tom comprese i rischi.
7581043,ita,Tom non sembra mai arrabbiato.
7581044,ita,Tom deve essere stato offeso.
6469937,ita,Sami è stato incolpato per tentato omicidio.
7568499,ita,"Dove andremo domani? ""A Malta."""
6218125,ita,Sto lavorando con lei adesso.
607100,ita,Alcune specie di uccelli non possono volare.
5913108,ita,Gli occhi di Tom erano incollati alla TV.
6985413,ita,Lui dovrebbe avere quarant'anni.
2700855,ita,Dove posso comprare un programma?
383575,ita,Si sono dimenticati di chiudere la porta a chiave.
4878348,ita,Penso che qualcuno avrebbe dovuto aiutare Tom.
4889249,ita,Non guido un'automobile.
6147618,ita,Perché li stiamo aiutando?
5037834,ita,Non l'ho assunta.
3658892,ita,La lampadina è scoppiata.
3926391,ita,Non hanno risolto nessun caso?
3811279,ita,Siamo stati accusati di furto.
3812192,ita,Kate non festeggia quasi mai il suo compleanno.
7043251,ita,Mary voleva tutti i dettagli.
3969581,ita,Non provarci di nuovo.
5386724,ita,Io penso che questo sia un ottimo sistema.
3421074,ita,Stiamo arrivando!
4721611,ita,Lei ha gli occhi di suo padre e il naso di sua madre.
3855780,ita,A me piacerebbe sempre sapere cosa pensa di me Marika.
5876954,ita,Io avevo un dolore terribile.
2218566,ita,Pensavo di essere semplicemente fortunata.
7702406,ita,So che Tom era un bambino prodigio.
7229148,ita,Sami mangiò tutto il cibo.
7706268,ita,Le chiesi di venire a vedermi.

5646912,ita,Io non mi aspettavo che Tom ci aiutasse.
5404195,ita,Vorreste vedervi con Tom?
4739612,ita,Nessuno ci vuole aiutare.
6985273,ita,Che ti sta succedendo ultimamente?

2929101,ita,Tu sei una persona orribile.
6540836,ita,Tom probabilmente sarà da solo.
5980416,ita,Non gli ho chiesto di tornare.
3441568,ita,Oggi non si esce.
5084612,ita,"Ma che differenza fa se pulisco la mia stanza oggi, domani o dopodomani, mamma?"
6742108,ita,"Se è così, telefona: aiuterò come posso."
5617605,ita,Voglio semplicemente morire.
1538709,ita,Quanti di voi lo riescono a vedere?
6726157,ita,Non hai visitato il Messico.
2874979,ita,Tu sei così magro.
5472727,ita,"Per favore, portate avanti la questione per il prossimo incontro."
934675,ita,Fumo sigarette.
812525,ita,Santo paglia borsa!
2005047,ita,Le sue lettere diventano meno significative.
3350707,ita,So che sei stanco.
7595687,ita,Andiamo a lavorare in Nuova Zelanda?
5668482,ita,Ho tanto lavoro da fare qui.
5830002,ita,Tom ha preso le mie chiavi.
7014896,ita,Tom non stava piangendo.
5554316,ita,Perché Tom mi chiama Mary?
3808881,ita,Marie è scivolata.
1098059,ita,Quella è una macchina Chrysler.
7628184,ita,Vanno a costruire mausolei in Somalia.
2198091,ita,Tom entrò nella stanza di Mary.
3797492,ita,Immagino che non dovrei essere troppo sorpresa.
5709335,ita,Era solo una cotta passeggera.

3675478,ita,Lui ama gli animali.
7594494,ita,Non andate a studiare in Vietnam?

5738857,ita,Spero che il Giappone osservi la sua costituzione.
5677760,ita,Cosa volevate da me?
4987072,ita,Non sono felice con esso.
2609171,ita,Tom non può aiutarvi ora.
1539199,ita,Tom non vuol spendere più di $300 per un motore usato.
7252897,ita,Non è troppo dura.
3306950,ita,Si decide domani?
4745828,ita,Lei pensa che vincerà una guerra diretta contro la Russia?
3790383,ita,Perché non mi risponderai?
7647750,ita,Andate a costruire palestre in Pakistan.
5949905,ita,Le vedrò questa sera.
2551913,ita,Chiederei a Tom.

5994139,ita,È interessato a loro?
2864624,ita,"In caso di emergenza, chiama il 110."
2001486,ita,Come state ora?
823429,ita,Si è alzato alle sei ed è uscito di casa alle sette.
5739884,ita,Il messaggio è molto chiaro.
6822656,ita,Io sto cercando un hotel poco costoso.
1677538,ita,Andiamo in spiaggia?
1237315,ita,Che cosa ci fai qui?
6470149,ita,Non mi piacciono le persone arroganti.
6556725,ita,Gli dica che richiamerò.
5388454,ita,Stasera Tom terrà una conferenza.
1002141,ita,Non può diventare peggio.
3432228,ita,"Se continui, non esci più!"
5436057,ita,Io disturbavo.
3159785,ita,Me lo dia.

5728647,ita,Sono curiosa riguardo a qualcosa.
2850494,ita,"In più, la disoccupazione aumenta."
5332461,ita,Come vi siete cambiati i vestiti così rapidamente?

6056069,ita,Tom non ti renderà felice.
7103544,ita,"Dove pensano di andare per lavoro? ""In Germania."""
3585776,ita,Magari ti avessi dato retta!
7045397,ita,Non riuscivo a sentire Tom.
6540231,ita,La stanno cercando tutti.
376594,ita,Sei una bellissima farfalla.

2445884,ita,Riesci a sentirla cantare?
3218602,ita,Non era sospeso nessuno.
6056061,ita,Mi voglio scusare con tutti qui.
6152907,ita,Hai fatto un buon lavoro oggi.
3779009,ita,Sbrigati! Il treno sta per partire.
7727161,ita,Niente sarà lo stesso.
3091065,ita,Il nuovo taglio ti dona!
6628414,ita,Probabilmente vincerà la nostra squadra.
2717972,ita,Non preoccuparti del lavoro.
5973776,ita,Tom cercherà di essere lì in orario.

4200873,ita,Adesso Dan è un ministro.
3156553,ita,A volte va a Tokyo per affari.
7642503,ita,Andate a costruire allevamenti in Uganda.

6723820,ita,Non avete mai visitato la Svezia.
5358865,ita,Tom può parlare.
2961872,ita,Ho parlato con degli amici.
1272276,ita,Amo il mio dialetto italiano.
5910694,ita,Questo ragazzo è venuto qualche volta da mio figlio.
5092141,ita,Gli operai minacciarono di scioperare.
6855138,ita,Vi dovete cambiare prima della festa.
3574382,ita,Non è una sala ricreativa?
5019265,ita,Come se cose del genere non accadessero già tutti i giorni...
608871,ita,Tra tutti i suoi fratelli Antonio è il meno saggio.
1688587,ita,Cosa significa quella parola?
5981588,ita,Adesso smammi.
1650060,ita,La lingua comune di molti anime è rappresentata dai sottotitoli.
4774677,ita,È quello che dico anche io!

7525595,ita,Mi ha detto che voleva un cane.
7655740,ita,Non vai a costruire birrerie in Svezia?
1329355,ita,Apra la porta e lasci entrare il cane.
4619256,ita,Mi devo solo procurare la tessera?
6946394,ita,Sarebbero stati sprecati.
6549140,ita,Non so quando Tom se ne andrà da Boston.
3847885,ita,Siamo scivolati.
3406610,ita,Guardate cosa ho trovato mentre facevo pulizie.
5434282,ita,Così si può consegnare l'anima a Dio!
5721348,ita,Ci dia un colpo di telefono.
3772180,ita,Ciò è davvero entusiasmante!
6851770,ita,È molto stressante.
6944973,ita,Abbiamo avuto una vivace discussione su questo.
5992090,ita,Tom saltava su e giù.
6746412,ita,"Di che nazionalità sono i loro insegnanti? ""Greca."""

1611503,ita,"Il ""lancio del nano"" non è una disciplina olimpica."
6019684,ita,Non vi serve questo.
5478031,ita,Tom è il giocatore più vecchio della nostra squadra.
2332202,ita,Il latte è in frigo.
2578646,ita,Mi sto innervosendo.
3635553,ita,Che cos'ha fatto alle mie mutandine?
4878347,ita,Penso ancora che avremmo dovuto aiutare Tom.
2189133,ita,Il mio amico vuole un'auto tutta sua.
7119343,ita,Chi ti ha detto dov'era il mio ufficio?
6697858,ita,Tom non è il capo di Mary.
5997221,ita,Tua madre sarebbe stata molto orgogliosa di te.
3981766,ita,Ne hai visto uno?

3395949,ita,Lo sai che ti vogliamo bene?
3368121,ita,Dovrà essere avvisata la famiglia di Tom.
4711646,ita,"Nella mitologia greca, Hypnos è il dio del sonno e fratello di Thanatos, il dio della morte."
6094821,ita,Perché sei arrabbiato con lei?
2797302,ita,Chiamate un'ambulanza.
3980542,ita,Ha nevicato molto ieri.
3013155,ita,Il brutto è quando si deve uscire lo stesso.
5288278,ita,Sono riconoscente per il tuo sostegno.
7000663,ita,Lui non studia geografia.
2962500,ita,L'hanno messo in galera.
4336067,ita,L'hai detto a qualcun altro?
4204097,ita,Lui portò la cena.
7604541,ita,Vanno a fare soldi in Lettonia?
7675084,ita,Lei dice di non avere mai pianto.
2747975,ita,Siete troppo tesi.
3010971,ita,Purtroppo come sai non potevo.
6827398,ita,Io ho altre due lettere da scrivere.
1461780,ita,È lotta di classe.
2607801,ita,Tom ha risposto con attenzione.
5010276,ita,Non andare da nessuna parte senza di lei.
3333490,ita,Non c'è ragione per non stare in casa con un tempo così.
6902252,ita,Avete come minimo tre opzioni.
6030964,ita,Vi ho viste danzare una volta.
5476754,ita,Tom ha dato il suo coltello a Mary.
6893982,ita,Tom indovinò la risposta giusta.
7565462,ita,Martedì non si fa francese.
4242756,ita,Lui l'ha appena trovata.
6966911,ita,Questa è roba molto interessante.
612694,ita,Mi ha raccontato una storia interessante.
2727348,ita,Tom e Mary erano seduti tre file dietro a John.
3119830,ita,Il Consiglio chiedeva l'annullamento dell'atto di adozione del bilancio e la Corte ha accettato la sua richiesta.
6552764,ita,Sono piuttosto sicuro che a Tom piaccia il suo lavoro.
2069163,ita,Io esigo che gli studenti siano sempre puntuali.
6448871,ita,Tom non si sposerà con voi.
5585287,ita,Vuoi che mescoli le carte?
3062238,ita,Il cane non vi farà del male.
5993018,ita,Hanno riso tutti tranne loro.
1504744,ita,Tom fece molti errori.
3126207,ita,Lo porteremo ai potenziali clienti.
3761697,ita,E questo cosa c'entra con l'articolo?
6632025,ita,Il mio migliore amico non è bosniaco.
7097031,ita,Sbrigatevi e finite la vostra colazione.
4996728,ita,Voi fate parte della mia vita.
7638607,ita,Vado a costruire autostrade in Spagna?
3509727,ita,Tom era molto stanco.
5512136,ita,Sei stato qui da allora?
6762605,ita,"Dove andremo per lavoro? ""In Bielorussia."""
4963512,ita,Quanto è ampio il suo vocabolario?
6721089,ita,Abbiamo il passaporto algerino?
3343655,ita,È andata ieri in ospedale.
7457514,ita,"Suoni la chitarra proprio come un professionista, non è vero?"
6580471,ita,Penso che Tom e Mary siano ipocriti.
2556112,ita,Mi serve una pausa.
4478209,ita,Lui non sa per nulla l'inglese.
7602710,ita,Andiamo a cercare qualcuno in Brasile?
3503427,ita,Avevo bisogno di sfogarmi.
6013812,ita,Non so se sia questo ciò che ha messo nei casini Tom oppure no.
5114311,ita,Tom sparò accidentalmente a Mary.
7598217,ita,Non andiamo a imparare qualcosa in Nigeria.
986418,ita,"Sono contento, perché studiacchio il neerlandese."
2799208,ita,Sapete dov'è andata?
3497378,ita,Scappo al lavoro!
6537356,ita,Tom stava indossando una camicia blu.
7615677,ita,Non vai a costruire ospedali in Etiopia?
1623308,ita,Ho passato due ore a leggere un libro la notte scorsa.
6173041,ita,Vivono separati.
6070663,ita,"Abito a Boston ora, però vengo da Chicago."
4475758,ita,Io sono annoiata dalla mia vita.
7046633,ita,Chiesi a Tom la sua opinione.
1255730,ita,Lui sembra gentile.
5709281,ita,Abbiamo cinque ospiti questa sera.
2995307,ita,Io sono caduta dalla bici.
3494761,ita,Non capisco perché fanno così.
5571122,ita,Ora questo testo è stato tradotto in diverse lingue.
7740036,ita,Darai le dimissioni?
7625238,ita,Vai a costruire stadi in Lettonia.
3397034,ita,Ma siamo in estate o in inverno?
7102579,ita,"Dove siete stati per lavoro? ""In Argentina."""
5293476,ita,Io sono umile.
4467753,ita,Riesco a crederci a malapena.
4940321,ita,Io sono già stata punita.
5348152,ita,Ci siamo separate.
5969249,ita,Stavo andando a fare compere con Tom.
1541476,ita,La nostra scuola comincia alle 7:15.
2706735,ita,Quant'è?
5964123,ita,La partita fu annullata a causa della pesante pioggia.
2191563,ita,Tu vivi nel deserto?
6605240,ita,Ho scordato il cellulare a casa.
2833355,ita,Lui di certo non è un coglione.
7643219,ita,Andate a costruire allevamenti in Austria?
5633186,ita,Tom ti ha chiesto di uscire?
5477053,ita,Speravo di farvi una sorpresa.
7699523,ita,Io non ho detto a Tom chi mi ha aiutata.
609102,ita,Siete andate direttamente a casa dopo la scuola ieri?
3145513,ita,La pigrizia è madre di tutti i vizi.
1614197,ita,Si è depositato un metro e mezzo di neve.
5347550,ita,È rigida.
2377579,ita,Mi piacciono questi due.
5266717,ita,Sono brava a cucinare.
6445053,ita,Quanto zucchero hai comprato?
7727141,ita,Vogliamo la stessa cosa.
7627881,ita,Vado a costruire mausolei in Libano.
2223982,ita,Lui è il ragazzo più alto.
6299484,ita,Le ho conosciute ieri sera.
1553767,ita,"Non dissi nulla, e ciò la fece adirare."
4150452,ita,Voi siete al sicuro qui dentro.
5353710,ita,Gli spaghetti alla carbonara sono il piatto forte di quel cuoco?
3067317,ita,Tom si sta facendo aiutare.
5316036,ita,Io sono il tuo uomo tuttofare.
6536575,ita,Tom riesce a farlo qua.
1350858,ita,Vi aspettiamo!
7626467,ita,Andate a costruire case in Siria.
766247,ita,Dicono che sia molto ricco.
4959562,ita,Noi abbiamo giocato a carte dopo cena.
4246937,ita,Lui dovrà andare lì.
7045759,ita,È mai stata in Asia?
7593583,ita,Non vai a studiare in Egitto.
6747043,ita,"Di che nazionalità sono i nostri dottori? ""Spagnola."""
3663216,ita,Io ho provato a scrivere con la mano sinistra.
3114765,ita,Tom lo sapeva che Mary sarebbe potuta essere molto persuasiva.
6062873,ita,È esattamente dove ho intenzione di andare.
7662034,ita,Non va a costruire basi militari in Sudafrica?
7613354,ita,Andate a costruire ponti in Siria.
4872055,ita,Aggiungete la maionese.
4358204,ita,Io riesco a vedere la luce.
5872641,ita,Ella è molto nota sia in India sia in Cina.
5081150,ita,Il tuo silenzio mi rende nervosa.
6749848,ita,"Di che nazionalità sono le nostre sorelle? ""Marocchina."""
3246595,ita,Studi o ti diverti?
5022438,ita,Tom cosa pensa davvero di Mary?
6219816,ita,L'acqua scorre.
2745132,ita,Io devo studiare in vista dell'esame.
5461725,ita,"Per favore, venite nel mio ufficio."
5982942,ita,Questo è il giorno migliore della mia vita.
6367276,ita,Pensate che dovremmo cambiarlo?
5730533,ita,Mi dica dove li posso trovare.
6533925,ita,Non bevo spesso del vino.
6750814,ita,"Di che nazionalità erano i loro nonni? ""Argentina."""
6393320,ita,Tom venne finalmente a casa.
2844910,ita,Io sono riuscita a non venire neanche una sera.
3145917,ita,Chi mal semina mal raccoglie.
3835042,ita,Oggi mi arrabbio per questo.
4593502,ita,Ringiovanivo.
638605,ita,Devi spegnere la corrente prima di controllare il circuito.
2972235,ita,Mi dispiace di sprecare il suo tempo.
6604482,ita,Oggi andiamo nella sala coi computer?
7116532,ita,"Per favore, non faccia nulla di pericoloso."
5993024,ita,Non lo conosciamo nemmeno.
5585592,ita,Posso darti un consiglio?
3564145,ita,È un pessimo esempio.
5952383,ita,Posso vederle oggi?
7321302,ita,Tom era vestito come un bidello.
3050218,ita,Io non posso dirti tutti i miei segreti.
3397557,ita,Bisogna agire!
6963800,ita,Credi a Zeus?
4396866,ita,Sarà un successo!
3757825,ita,Dite di no a Tom.
5534128,ita,Le cellule del nostro corpo si rinnovano quasi completamente ogni sette anni. Si può ritenere che noi vediamo allo specchio la stessa persona che vedevamo sette anni fa?
6797521,ita,Pulii il bagno.
5141590,ita,Ero incantato dalla musica.
5883326,ita,Ho sbucciato la mela.
5352768,ita,Guardate cos'ho trovato sotto il divano.
2230656,ita,Vincerò utilizzando qualsiasi mezzo necessario.
5984384,ita,Ho lucidato le sue scarpe per lui.
4586876,ita,Cantava.
4243067,ita,Le mucche hanno le mammelle.
2795958,ita,Poteva aspettare ancora un po' per dire certe cose.
2763202,ita,Non sarà la prima volta che mi capita.
2559713,ita,Io lo distruggerò.
3572259,ita,Tom è risultato positivo all'ebola.
3361432,ita,Quel tizio è un tale perdente.
3235009,ita,Mi sono persa?
6994205,ita,Sono dipendente dalla nicotina.
5168968,ita,Non bisogna sembrare disperati.
7607427,ita,Vanno a fare amicizie in Cina?
6204855,ita,"Certo, mi ricordo di lui."
4166508,ita,Voi preferite un albergo vicino all'aeroporto.
1012360,ita,Secondo gli scienziati l'atmosfera sta diventando più calda anno dopo anno.
3298292,ita,Ne ho appena visto passare uno!
3529003,ita,Ci vorrebbero gli inceneritori.
6884815,ita,Tom ha trascorso metà della sua vita a Boston.
3410241,ita,Voi vivete qui?
3669620,ita,Tu hai letto la Sacra Bibbia?
3345545,ita,Il tacchino fagocita.
7606263,ita,Non andate a fare carriera in Francia?
3180091,ita,Il messia non si contesta.
4073804,ita,Ha un po' di moneta?
5651435,ita,Lui ha chiaramente mentito.
3431691,ita,Cosa faranno i tuoi genitori per Ferragosto?
1008276,ita,Questo dovrebbe saperlo fare!
5271618,ita,Tom non ha il tempo per rispondere a tutte le mie domande.
7247898,ita,Io penso che le barrette di granola siano salutari.
4534896,ita,Il film era orribile.
7727127,ita,Le auguro lo stesso.
4591653,ita,È tutto venduto.
3264485,ita,Tom era sbalordito.
5659129,ita,È solamente troppo vero.
6725745,ita,Non abbiamo visitato la Siria.
7652919,ita,Vado a costruire templi in Marocco?
2555848,ita,Combattete come uomini.
2215538,ita,Io mi sento sempre depresso.
6606689,ita,Non vale guardare le soluzioni!
1260025,ita,Sei tu?
3662818,ita,Vorrei essere un'insegnante.
4243204,ita,I gufi sono carini.
5994199,ita,"Non lo avete visto, vero?"
6720476,ita,Hanno il passaporto serbo?
1256209,ita,Ha scelto?
7014863,ita,Cosa comprerete?
7613471,ita,Non vado a costruire ponti in Uganda.
3571748,ita,Aspetto da anni.
6753740,ita,"Di che nazionalità erano le sue zie? ""Libica."""
3009136,ita,Vorresti altro vino?
7063472,ita,Cosa faresti se incontrassi un abitante di un altro pianeta?
7647602,ita,Va a costruire palestre a Malta.
6877719,ita,L'avete letto tutto?
5589433,ita,Sono a Boston dal 2013.
3397346,ita,Lo so io a che pensi.
5771047,ita,"Per piacere, mi porti da lui."
2883338,ita,Cosa vuole sapere Tom?
7604487,ita,Andate a fare soldi in Olanda?
3294179,ita,"Al volante della sua macchina da più di quattro ore, Tom lottava contro il sonno."
7606495,ita,Vai a fare amicizie in Argentina.
3377241,ita,Per quale ragione vai a Tokyo?
5384318,ita,Io voglio giocare a calcio.
3383245,ita,Questo lavoro va oltre la mia competenza.
1117959,ita,Vada avanti da sola.
5532380,ita,Questa è la casa dove lei viveva prima.
5119366,ita,Tu non hai affamato i cani.
5585682,ita,Siamo qui per sostenerti.
6130112,ita,Non devi dirgli la verità.
6545202,ita,La tua automobile è blu?
6737518,ita,"Tom sembrava molto arrabbiato, vero?"
2865605,ita,Sei una ragazza molto carina.
5901600,ita,Le persone effettuano spesso delle brutte scelte.
4289382,ita,Succede qualcosa tra un mese?
4469823,ita,Cosa le hai detto esattamente?
7004803,ita,MI capiscono?
7597168,ita,Andate a insegnare a Malta?
3743086,ita,Che mucchio di idioti!
5778644,ita,Ha riscritto la poesia.
5735404,ita,Avete preso una decisione?
379525,ita,Mi sento felice.
7219304,ita,Scelga me.
2177696,ita,Mi mancherà questo posto.
645570,ita,Salve signore!
5719049,ita,Chiedete a lei invece.
7609515,ita,Vanno a fare affari in Norvegia?
5370457,ita,Lo faccia il prima possibile.
3625781,ita,Tom è stato riassegnato.
2022905,ita,Io ho un'altra idea.
6916687,ita,Io la vedrò domani a scuola.
6117331,ita,C'è un problema col vostro ordine?
6916955,ita,Qui non succede nulla!
3868024,ita,Io sono occupato in questo momento.
3690344,ita,"Non preoccupatevi, capita a tutti."
6373056,ita,Non ci conosci neppure.
4471091,ita,Mi blocca la vista.
1989003,ita,Faceva molto freddo quella sera.
6799417,ita,Io lo faccio a volte.
2706100,ita,Era un gioco da ragazzi risolvere il problema!
5231984,ita,Non andrò in Australia quest'anno.
955039,ita,Sei sicura di volerci andare?
2792282,ita,Lei è una bugiarda.
4463962,ita,Non importa a nessuno chi è.
3496455,ita,"Pochi giorni più tardi, Tom trovò un nuovo lavoro."
3814966,ita,Non ero terribile.
2526212,ita,Mi fece un inchino educato.
6636036,ita,Sono stato ingiusto.
2213658,ita,Lei ha mai mangiato in questo ristorante?
3050518,ita,Dove hai preso queste informazioni?
3354534,ita,Perché non hai neppure visitato la Germania?
5047359,ita,Faccio in tempo a vedere la partita?
5538190,ita,Mary è sempre stata sola.
7595538,ita,Vai a lavorare in Somalia?
4598947,ita,Lui ha dei problemi?
7632056,ita,Non andiamo a costruire università in Giappone?
5123960,ita,Sono felice di essere in grado di aiutarvi.
1099984,ita,Lui ha negato di essere il ladro.
4517351,ita,Ne comprerebbe una?
3375345,ita,La casa più vicina è due miglia da qui.
1337798,ita,Viaggiò in Giappone.
2466251,ita,Quando sei tornato dalla Germania?
6448673,ita,È improbabile che Tom lo farà.
2961499,ita,A questo bisogna contestare il fatto che abbia il cervello!
5537163,ita,Ho così tanto da dire.
7606600,ita,Andiamo a fare amicizie in Belgio.
4460931,ita,Loro hanno cercato l'aiuto di Tom.
3781086,ita,Non so perché tu l'abbia fatto.
1311900,ita,Abita a Londra.
2102490,ita,Noi non riusciamo a vedere alcuna stella stasera.
1426881,ita,Sei pronto a uscire?
842709,ita,Ci sono dei libri sotto alla scrivania?
7663736,ita,Non dovrebbe andare da solo.
6945095,ita,Tom è un fariseo.
1073951,ita,Questo è perché si è arrabbiato con voi.
5619925,ita,È tutto pronto adesso?
6448629,ita,Quanto cioccolato avete comprato?
5959189,ita,Non sarò in grado di aiutarli.
1129772,ita,Ieri abbiamo celebrato un evento soprannaturale veramente raro.
2968710,ita,L'hanno costretto a scusarsi.
2582658,ita,Una volta vivevo lì.
2519788,ita,Possiamo fare delle scarpe.
6910445,ita,Tom dovrà aiutare Mary.
4726891,ita,Vende conchiglie di mare a Chelsea.
4994828,ita,Nessuno le troverà.
3220243,ita,Non si uccidono così i cittadini.
7648288,ita,Vai a costruire palestre negli Stati Uniti?
6471229,ita,Non ho mai visto una di queste prima.
5397611,ita,Mary si è fatta un piercing al naso.
5719704,ita,Nessuno li può fermare.
5820089,ita,Lui rispose senza suggerimenti.
3117744,ita,Alcune scene sono state accentuate nel film.
2697835,ita,Voi leggete le istruzioni?
5477996,ita,Tom ha iniziato a pranzare.
1740671,ita,Non viene a lavorare perché è ammalato.
3431584,ita,Detesto lavorare dopo cena.
6987511,ita,Perché vuole andare in Olanda?
5739278,ita,La dovranno accettare.
6744054,ita,"Di che nazionalità sono? ""Tunisina."""
2777588,ita,Tom non lo sapeva neppure che Mary se n'era andata.
6668927,ita,È l'auto che voglio comprare.
4747737,ita,Tom premette il pulsante giusto.
5164835,ita,Io ho intenzione di sfidarlo a un gioco.
2714002,ita,Sono molto infelice.
4504667,ita,Soltanto tre persone sono sopravvissute.
4274816,ita,Metta lì il libro.
7597695,ita,Vado a imparare qualcosa in Arabia Saudita.
5227871,ita,Perché è il mio turno?
7616855,ita,Va a costruire scuole in India?
5061485,ita,Il batimetro è uno strumento di misurazione.
6901781,ita,"Per favore, prestatemi la vostra automobile."
6159611,ita,Vogliamo tutte che Tom abbia successo.
3739268,ita,Tom è il fratellino che non ho mai avuto.
6210498,ita,Non ho potuto proteggerla.
2498393,ita,Questo è un grande!
759860,ita,Il sole sorge ad est e tramonta ad ovest.
3866822,ita,Io sarei dovuto essere pronto.
4899978,ita,Alcune persone sembrano essere resistenti all'infezione da HIV.
5056563,ita,È un modo interessante di fare le cose.
6745484,ita,"Di che nazionalità sono i loro cugini? ""Rumena."""
3953310,ita,Ho aggiunto il suo nome all'elenco.
2396614,ita,Ti meriti di essere felice.
2356122,ita,La pazienza vince alla fine.
3509392,ita,Io amo entrambe.
6300389,ita,Potremmo parlare di lui.
4513436,ita,Dobbiamo solo essere creativi.
2555785,ita,Tom è fuggito?
3101756,ita,Disse al suo assistente che avrebbe vinto.
6669659,ita,Sei andato da qualche parte ieri?
1307771,ita,Pensate che io sia stupida?
3236541,ita,Sono abbastanza sicuro che funzionerà.
3663842,ita,"Non mi importa, OK?"
1543132,ita,La mia tavola è vecchia.
1809163,ita,Ma è enorme!
4946740,ita,Voi uscirete domani?
5524747,ita,Dille di telefonarmi.
3176729,ita,Siete ingiusti.
5654813,ita,Avete telefonato a Tom?
5481344,ita,Chi è in torto secondo voi?
4969200,ita,Io sono una purista.
4460360,ita,Dimentica.
7068889,ita,Io penso che Tom non sia andato alla festa con Mary.
6065889,ita,Chi è il ragazzo che sta nuotando nel fiume?
4552352,ita,Io amo quel piano.
1866055,ita,C'è qualcuno che potrebbe farmeli avere in una qualche maniera il prima possibile?
4893576,ita,Non lo vogliamo più.
3507047,ita,Preparati per andare a letto.
2455404,ita,Io sono andata al parco ieri.
2806048,ita,La situazione è tremenda.
7613770,ita,Non vanno a costruire ponti in Cile.
3496951,ita,Tu sei una vera rompicoglioni.
1117094,ita,Versate l'obolo a Belisario.
3397066,ita,Non possono mica mancare!
6751588,ita,"Di che nazionalità erano i vostri fratelli? ""Malese."""
3562117,ita,Non ci si deve fidare di quell'uomo.
384839,ita,"No, non è il mio nuovo ragazzo."
4881653,ita,Lei è un traditore.
3183247,ita,Era per chiedere.
3404879,ita,Voglio rimanere a casa con la mia famiglia.

2181417,ita,Non si può contattare Tom direttamente.
5827144,ita,I negoziati continuano.
3328560,ita,Mi sembra giusto!
3248956,ita,Creda in se stesso o nessun altro lo farà.
3044516,ita,Io volevo nuotare ogni giorno.

1645919,ita,Come mai non ha niente da dire?
3288318,ita,Semplicemente so che non è giusto.
2833482,ita,Io probabilmente sembro ridicola.
3110066,ita,Un segno di una celebrità è spesso che il suo nome vale più dei suoi servizi.
6767883,ita,Voi eravate fortunate.
3321205,ita,Non volevo che tu la leggessi.
6751738,ita,"Di che nazionalità erano i tuoi fratelli? ""Svedese."""

5598904,ita,Devi continuare a lottare.
6857250,ita,Mi chiedo se Tom sia a casa oppure no.
5381669,ita,Sono stufa del pesce.
5323666,ita,Studiai prima di cena.
5677850,ita,Lo posso portare.
4279810,ita,Tu affronti i problemi.

4128791,ita,"Dareste un messaggio a Tom, per piacere?"
3899625,ita,Noi eravamo gelosi.
7598478,ita,Vai a imparare qualcosa in Bangladesh?
3833576,ita,"Paragonata alla sua, la mia collezione non è niente."
1743132,ita,"Ha poi aggiunto: ""Le dico la verità..."""
390617,ita,"Fumavo molto prima, ma ho smesso."
2742690,ita,Io bevo del caffè alla mattina.

3191222,ita,Spero di vederti presto!
5004471,ita,Voi avete un problema con quello che è stato suggerito?
3213257,ita,Questo non è nulla.
386811,ita,Ho perso mia moglie l'anno scorso.
1268012,ita,Non mi puoi arrestare per essere un clown.
6874349,ita,Tom dice di aver mal di pancia.
6699603,ita,Sami voleva avere la situazione sotto controllo.
6595718,ita,Sai perché Tom e Mary non vengono più qui?

7016967,ita,Che cosa indosserai?
6944776,ita,Io amo il cibo messicano.

7569929,ita,"Dove andranno fra due settimane? ""Negli Stati Uniti."""
612176,ita,L'incidente è avvenuto venerdì.
4263094,ita,Chi mi fa il caffè?
6323024,ita,Ho parlato con più calma che ho potuto.
5609938,ita,"Tom ti sta dando sui nervi, vero?"
4985511,ita,Penso che sia colpa di Tom.
4086012,ita,State per prendere le vostre automobili.
2150077,ita,Hai energia a sufficienza?
1328950,ita,Vorreste giocare con noi?
1429292,ita,Andò a visitarlo in ospedale ogni giorno.
3646059,ita,E quindi cosa c'entra?
3665844,ita,Io non ho spento la luce.
6884801,ita,Questa macchina andava molto veloce.
6892641,ita,Questo è un paese libero?
1068276,ita,Parla il latino?
4362676,ita,Lei teneva in mano un fiore.
5750626,ita,"Cosa berrai, Tom?"
5504056,ita,Quella sarebbe la mia risposta.
3545333,ita,Pensa che Tom sia colpevole?
5065297,ita,Vi fidate di lei?
4564648,ita,Considera il divorzio.
6636376,ita,L'ho suggerito.
1429377,ita,Perché non si possono fare pupazzi di neve di fianco alla chiesa?
2430376,ita,Io non capisco una parola.
2897330,ita,Io sono il papà di Tom.
3509110,ita,Ho sognato un mondo senza religioni. Un mondo in cui nessuno aveva la presunzione di possedere la verità assoluta. Era un bel sogno.
6052066,ita,Non la voglio dimenticare.
1446453,ita,"Li ho invitati, ma hanno preferito non entrare."
2683046,ita,Chiesi la loro approvazione.
2794831,ita,Io penso che avremo bisogno di più tempo.
1586103,ita,Io sono bravo in storia.
3533014,ita,Me lo hai insegnato tu.
2723768,ita,Sita sorrise.
5949888,ita,Li vedo piuttosto spesso.
3815106,ita,Marie accusava falsamente le persone.
6789551,ita,Tu pensi che Tom sia nei guai?
3537044,ita,Sapete la strada?
6004612,ita,"Mi piace molto Windows 8, ma preferisco XP."
5984175,ita,Penso che dovremmo andare con Tom.

5362351,ita,Siamo piuttosto occupati al momento.
2844130,ita,Oggi mi sa che mi rifugio nella realtà virtuale.
6612765,ita,Il mio amico è gallese.
3128226,ita,Le notizie si diffondono velocemente.
3558857,ita,Volete davvero aspettare Tom?
3504584,ita,Voi lo avete già vissuto.
1294864,ita,Non potrebbe più vivere senza di me!
3863455,ita,Posso insegnarti a onorare Dio.
4796041,ita,Ce ne andiamo presto?
7571878,ita,Penso che non andrete per lavoro in Olanda.
3607292,ita,La leadership si esercita non tanto a parole quanto attraverso l'atteggiamento e le azioni.
2129897,ita,Oggi ti chiedo di scongelare il pollo.
3806960,ita,"Si fida di noi, vero?"
6963362,ita,"Tom è il fratellastro di Mary, vero?"
6721251,ita,Avete il passaporto congolese?

1539425,ita,Cosa ci vuole per vincere una causa?
825441,ita,Lavoro per voi.
4829242,ita,"Che io sappia, c'è da diversi anni."
2277870,ita,Ricevo spesso delle lettere da lui.
6849687,ita,La cucina è grande.
6746999,ita,"Di che nazionalità sono i nostri dottori? ""Albanese."""
6017703,ita,Ditele che sto tornando.
7662747,ita,Non va a costruire negozi in Niger.
7325251,ita,Mi piacerebbe fare qualcosa di diverso.
2841276,ita,Spero di restare.
3543337,ita,Ha perso il controllo della partita dopo otto minuti.
2688017,ita,Io ho dato i libri a questa studentessa.
7422167,ita,Io voglio solamente scomparire.
7605730,ita,Vai a fare carriera in Irlanda?
2920812,ita,Non sono come Tom.
7649368,ita,Vai a costruire moschee in Islanda del Nord.
4508972,ita,Preferirei non farlo.
4393257,ita,Tom si è seduto sul divano.
4358803,ita,Io non conosco ancora le regole.
5019155,ita,È proprio un coniglio?
6962486,ita,Vai al parcheggio?
1850828,ita,Qualunque cosa è ben accetta!
4313634,ita,"Tom è fuori di testa, vero?"
1647776,ita,L'Africa sta esportando manzo in Europa.
4274525,ita,Quale macchina è la sua?
4137975,ita,Loro hanno bisogno di un avvocato.
1972240,ita,Noi dobbiamo lavorare duramente.
4278067,ita,Ho bevuto il vino.
5073437,ita,Sono l'ultima che l'ha visto.
4504705,ita,Erano sorpresi.
5436064,ita,Io approfittavo.
2421915,ita,Ci sono molti edifici alti in quella città.
2614631,ita,Tom è grosso.
2520785,ita,Ero l'unico uomo.
5717107,ita,Le tenga tranquille.
991888,ita,Glielo chiesi di punto in bianco.
5558227,ita,Avete letto tutto?
3349046,ita,Lei è una musulmana cinese dagli occhi blu.
2842971,ita,Il trattato di amicizia franco-tedesca è stato firmato più di quarant'anni fa.
4403980,ita,Mi colava molto il naso.
7706041,ita,Controllai l'indicatore.
3528055,ita,Noi siamo fioristi.
2458099,ita,Abita di fianco a me.
3782112,ita,Tom scrive una lettera.
3374943,ita,Chi la capisce?
5415828,ita,Si prega di uscire di qui immediatamente.
3976729,ita,Il dolore era straziante.
4985059,ita,Io volevo correre a casa.
3834896,ita,Tom è molto ottimista.
1018609,ita,Oggi pomeriggio c'è un esame di inglese.
3109777,ita,La donna beve dell'acqua ora.
6450377,ita,Scommetto che Tom lo farà.
1794174,ita,"Finirò il lavoro in una settimana, cioè il 5 maggio."
3121888,ita,Laurie era molto gentile.
6215103,ita,Eravate innamorate di me?
6803835,ita,Vorrei aver studiato il francese.
5946819,ita,Devo avvertirle.
1546725,ita,"Per favore, spegni la luce così posso dormire."
3149770,ita,Siete sicure dal pericolo qui.
5017349,ita,Non c'è bisogno di essere nervosi.
5686960,ita,Io guardo continuamente la TV.
4243371,ita,Io non la tradirei mai!
5999010,ita,Gli ho detto che non ero interessata.
3187515,ita,Non voglio mentire a Tom.
7103153,ita,"Dove vuole andare in vacanza? ""In Portogallo."""
7140192,ita,L'ha detto?
425386,ita,I tuoi capelli sono troppo lunghi.
6831960,ita,Io sono brava in quello che faccio.
2670563,ita,Tom ha ancora mandato tutto a puttane.
4217847,ita,Io sono ferita.
4540073,ita,Avete fatto qualcosa di sbagliato?
4243643,ita,Tom potrebbe essere in grado di aiutare.
7071125,ita,Io pensavo che Tom odiasse Mary.
3126137,ita,Sarà informato a tempo debito.
2882440,ita,Che ci sarà da ridere?
7572855,ita,Penso che andranno per svago in Australia.
3942618,ita,"Il dialogo si può avere con chi è intenzionato ad ascoltare, non con chi impone la propria volontà."
3013179,ita,Tu da dove l'hai ricavata?
3360437,ita,I genitori di Tommaso hanno rifiutato di pagargli gli studi pur avendone i mezzi.
5683869,ita,Indovinò.
5717142,ita,Li disprezzo.
5356467,ita,Tom ha perso la speranza.
1794787,ita,Avrò finito il lavoro per le otto in punto.
3102568,ita,Tom voleva che Mary venisse per una cena anticipata.
4720729,ita,Conviene partire prima delle cinque.
4672831,ita,Voi eravate tutto per me!
3322185,ita,Lo chiederò a Tom.
3381719,ita,Perché ve ne siete andati dalla lezione ieri?
2968746,ita,L'erba grama non muore mai.
3850373,ita,"Oh, non siate così."
6612706,ita,La mia amica è danese.
1098309,ita,Non pensavate che lo si potesse fare.
2928703,ita,Non mangiare le ostriche.
3049276,ita,Tutto succede per una ragione.
481848,ita,La tua lettera mi ha resa felice.
5686461,ita,Glielo dirò.
7639489,ita,Va a costruire ristoranti in Canada.
7623258,ita,Non sono sicuro che sia la decisione giusta.
3061882,ita,Io non sono inglese.
2356422,ita,Non lasciarmi da sola!
4150059,ita,La seguirò da qualunque parte.
5546109,ita,Chi l'ha gettato?
5719659,ita,Non li prenda in giro.
1730775,ita,Il 1789 fu un anno fondamentale per la Francia.
3275878,ita,Lui si è battuto fino alla fine.
4247050,ita,Lui sta per farti vedere come catturare un pesce.
3832869,ita,Non facevano il pisolino.
4077593,ita,Stiamo per chiamare il cuoco.
7639903,ita,Non andiamo a costruire ristoranti in Olanda.
3235211,ita,Il restauro è un elemento chiave del testo?
5293528,ita,Tom vuole questo.
6745950,ita,"Di che nazionalità sono i suoi amici? ""Libanese."""
3275851,ita,Si è battuto.
3364128,ita,Hai dato un senso alla mia domenica.
3461187,ita,Lui ci ha mandato la sua benedizione.
5956734,ita,Eravate gelosi di lei?
5749371,ita,Le lasci divertire.
2749199,ita,"Si può fare qualunque cosa con le maionesi, eccetto sedercisi sopra."
3198403,ita,Non ti incazzare.
7102323,ita,"Dove vorrebbero andare per lavoro? ""In Nuova Zelanda."""
7265641,ita,Che cosa vuole fare la sua amica?
4867468,ita,Ho già risposto alle domande di Tom.
4461982,ita,Il volo è stato annullato.
6726539,ita,Non hanno visitato l'Irlanda del Nord?
6718336,ita,Quale parte d'Europa vorresti visitare?
3353482,ita,"Non dovrei proprio chiederlo, ma potrebbe andare a prendere un po' di tofu per me?"
4985536,ita,A me piace veramente qui.
1280504,ita,Ha messo giù la biro.
2942925,ita,Qual è il salario minimo in Inghilterra?
6786517,ita,Lui ha deciso di lasciare la compagnia.
7655832,ita,Non andiamo a costruire birrerie in Scozia?
5049072,ita,Il mio insegnante mi ha consigliato di leggere questo libro.
7660517,ita,Non vai a costruire arene in Australia?
1841098,ita,Viviamo ancora insieme — lei non ha mai dormito fuori casa — ma non facciamo più sesso.
5005404,ita,Suo padre è un idiota.
4947388,ita,Loro ingrassano.
5784778,ita,Dovreste parlare con loro.
3407115,ita,Ci sarò sempre per aiutarvi.
2687243,ita,Io vorrei baciarti.
3893754,ita,L'ansia inizia a farsi sentire.
5489474,ita,Avremo una festa di benvenuto questa sera.
3441698,ita,Loro non erano per niente coraggiose.
4989963,ita,Lei verrà a casa mia domani?
6571686,ita,Non ho fortuna.
1712661,ita,L'uomo risponde alla descrizione nel giornale.
4720421,ita,Tom non aveva niente da dare.
7662465,ita,Andiamo a costruire negozi in Sudafrica.
7658816,ita,Andiamo a costruire baracche in Pakistan?
5525332,ita,La avete trovata.
5930666,ita,Non mi è mai importato di Tom.
5136829,ita,Avete dei giornali giapponesi?
1126953,ita,Penso di aver perso il mio biglietto.
5197937,ita,Abbiamo tutte finito qui.
3262326,ita,Non è bravo quanto me.
6213649,ita,Vuoi che ci avviciniamo?
2595362,ita,Le loro fattorie sono confinanti.
6219503,ita,Le guardie non mi videro.
1653918,ita,Lo dico come complimento.
1824545,ita,Ecco perché la gente l'ama.
4101398,ita,Io vorrei dirgli la verità.
6686495,ita,Eri in vacanza?
759908,ita,Questo libro è sulla Cina.
6609498,ita,Mi piace la lattuga.
2844625,ita,"Tempo permettendo, noi partiremo tra un'ora."
6010580,ita,Diamole tutti una mano.
5159561,ita,Noi siamo ancora aperti.
7648026,ita,Non andiamo a costruire palestre in Marocco.
1082997,ita,Scriverò una lettera domani.
1669707,ita,John è disattento. Lui fa molti errori.
3814694,ita,"Tu eri sposato, vero?"
2736456,ita,Domani atterrerà sulla luna.
6588909,ita,Ne sai qualcosa di cyber-sicurezza?
1748481,ita,Quella zona è piena di case nuove
4895200,ita,Io sarò amata.
5507234,ita,Tom sembra ubriaco fradicio.
4411631,ita,Hai preso qualcosa per loro?
4370171,ita,Tom è entrato nella sua stanza.
906247,ita,Sono arrivato qui ieri.
4268746,ita,Ma vai a girare il sugo!
3519297,ita,Non ha più senso ormai.
4200567,ita,Erano loro che hanno rotto la finestra ieri.
4670220,ita,A Tom non importa nemmeno.
7210950,ita,Non riusciva a sopportare il caldo in treno.
6162223,ita,"Non l'ha detto a loro, vero?"
7606619,ita,Andiamo a fare amicizie in Bangladesh.
6846999,ita,E cos'è la cosa principale secondo voi?
5363195,ita,Tom sapeva che Mary non era amichevole.
6702395,ita,"Tu non sei un dottore, vero?"
7658314,ita,Non vai a costruire baracche in Albania.
7570447,ita,Oggi avrete musica.
3429630,ita,Sei un traditore!
1282524,ita,Mi aiuterai a tradurre?
2959752,ita,Noi siamo tutte fiere di voi.
4948280,ita,Tom ha aperto una bottiglia di vino.
2458102,ita,In quale scuola va?
4741536,ita,Chi è Tatoeba? La tua nuova fidanzata?
3838619,ita,È il posto di Tom.
2465863,ita,Io ho bevuto molto e non riesco a ricordare molto di quello che è successo la scorsa notte.
2800893,ita,Non avete proprio soldi?
4417314,ita,Anche voi.
7574250,ita,Penso che non andrete per amore a Malta.
7614352,ita,Non andiamo a costruire ponti in Estonia?
5077135,ita,Ho detto che abbiamo finito.
5783300,ita,Qualcuno mi ha detto che non posso parcheggiare qui.
6600461,ita,Non penso che Tom e Mary siano assenti.
5996530,ita,La state facendo innervosire.
7630754,ita,Non vanno a costruire cimiteri in Argentina?
3485593,ita,La donna legge il giornale.
2800920,ita,Ha iniziato nonostante la pioggia.
5494205,ita,Non potremo fare niente che possa contrariare Tom.
7605703,ita,Vado a fare carriera in Canada?

1336121,ita,Sto ripensando a quella mattina.

4315777,ita,Quante tappe fa?
5386717,ita,Eri inutile.

2468961,ita,Lui disse che gli Stati Uniti non avrebbero interferito.
7531726,ita,Dicono che erano affamate.
4272344,ita,Tom è ancora svenuto sul pavimento.
5332611,ita,Tom deciderà.
6488851,ita,Avrebbe dovuto sposare me.
5378508,ita,Tom si cambiò.
3354434,ita,Ho avuto un bravo professore.
2498278,ita,Noi abbiamo parlato di varie cose.

6375489,ita,"Se per le la cosa è più semplice, puoi dare la colpa a me."
3317643,ita,Ma sei andato a Lourdes?
3471609,ita,Le lunghissime digressioni rompono l'unità del soggetto.
5393845,ita,Meglio rimanere in silenzio che parlare a vanvera.
4670195,ita,Costa molto di più.
5499232,ita,Lui rimarrà soddisfatto del risultato.
7631435,ita,Non vanno a costruire università in Inghilterra.
7651700,ita,Andate a costruire sinagoghe in Italia?

4512104,ita,Tutto dipende da questo.
2448301,ita,I tabloid asseriscono che il cetriolo assassino abbia sodomizzato la mucca pazza.
6587331,ita,Li abbiamo aiutati.
3511642,ita,Quanti commenti stupidi!
7594487,ita,Non andate a studiare in Bulgaria?
6445378,ita,Tom lo farà domani.
3290034,ita,Tu dai troppe informazioni.
2847680,ita,A me servono più coperture.
3019329,ita,Quello non sarà permesso.
5372782,ita,Tom non viene mai qui.
5827208,ita,Lei continuava a piangere.

6747449,ita,"Di che nazionalità sono le tue madri? ""Lituana."""
3181606,ita,Direi che è la soluzione.

5527620,ita,Che ne è stato di suo figlio?
4272346,ita,Scherzando ci hai visto giusto!

6604949,ita,I tuoi nonni erano degli idraulici.
6758689,ita,"Di che nazionalità erano le vostre cugine? ""Malese."""
2622263,ita,Tom non guida.
7093510,ita,Tom dice che Mary ha fame.
4242544,ita,Tom non aveva nulla da bere.
3533118,ita,Ho delle novità.
5599484,ita,Non mi importa quello che dice la società.
3636776,ita,Sei il proprietario di questa casa?

7570352,ita,Domani avrai matematica.
4484772,ita,Il viaggio è stato breve.
3021932,ita,"Chi non ha cane, caccia con gatto."
6378041,ita,La penso ancora così.
4428395,ita,Io potrei dire tutto a Tom.
6987693,ita,Perché non volevi andare a Malta?
7652675,ita,Non va a costruire templi in Libano.

6378170,ita,Qual è il grande mistero?
6610917,ita,Questo film è storico.
7616409,ita,Non vai a costruire scuole in Egitto.
2791112,ita,Ho appena iniziato.
4270051,ita,Tom desiderava avere un impiego decente.
5190090,ita,Io ero brava in questo.
2191347,ita,Stanno provando.
6758498,ita,"Di che nazionalità sono le loro cugine? ""Bosniaca."""
2839964,ita,Io penso che andrò a dormire.
5688948,ita,È prevista una notte serena.
7158375,ita,Penso che Tom sarà imprudente.
376587,ita,Ho solo un piccolo giardino.
4758750,ita,Devo andare. Arrivederci!
430304,ita,Ho già visto il film.
3337528,ita,Ne sono fermamente convinta!
6303446,ita,Le ho incontrate là.
3344486,ita,Perché le donne sono delle creature così fastidiose?
5959524,ita,Devo vederla alle due e mezza.

5184584,ita,Semplicemente dimenticate!
3792502,ita,Poi voglio sapere i giri loschi che hai.
4257501,ita,Lo dici solo perché abbiamo un figlio.
4662445,ita,Noi abbiamo un'altra fermata da fare.
5952855,ita,Dobbiamo salvarle.
4892238,ita,Non pensiamo che sia seria.
4044648,ita,Ma siamo in Italia?
4359576,ita,Io non l'ho mai incolpato.
2440033,ita,Loro hanno un produttore talentuoso.
6609476,ita,Mi piacciono i limoni.

4874794,ita,Ecco cosa c'è di sbagliato.
3820496,ita,Aggiungevano delle frasi.
4949503,ita,Dovrò confiscare il vostro coltello.
7738990,ita,Tutti nell'ufficio sanno dei suoi problemi.
4989916,ita,Non hai un aspetto molto buono. Sei ammalato?
2858299,ita,Io sono onnivora.
2681961,ita,Non ho mai pensato che sarei stato felice di vederla.
5362714,ita,Puoi farla per me?
3013248,ita,Chi non la pensa così?
6574959,ita,Tom e Mary sono delusi.
2396681,ita,Tom non riusciva a decidere cosa fare.
3870521,ita,"In questo caso, l'aggettivo va prima del sostantivo."
4742506,ita,È falso!
3356509,ita,"Ci sono certe cose a questo mondo che, non importa quanto tu le desideri, non si avvereranno mai."
7655338,ita,Vado a costruire birrerie in Uruguay?
7660020,ita,Non vanno a costruire arene in Estonia.

4322574,ita,Alla fine è questo?
2706566,ita,Io voglio tornare alla mia scrivania.
3175988,ita,Va bene tutto purché se ne parli.
6634899,ita,Tom e Mary hanno detto che non stanno facendo molti soldi.
7599768,ita,Andiamo a insegnare qualcosa in Islanda del Nord?
1861897,ita,Perché dovrei ascoltarti?
1201480,ita,Vi siete guadagnati il premio dell'anno.
388448,ita,Non ha senso estetico.
5064436,ita,Voi sapete che ho ragione.
6165683,ita,Non la vuole vedere?
4244195,ita,A voi è piaciuta?
7740081,ita,Tom sarà scoperto.

2689384,ita,Lo so che le piace essere una professoressa.
4961900,ita,Ho visto Tom attraversare il fiume a nuoto.
4953618,ita,Vediamo se questo aiuta.
2829417,ita,Lo so che una volta viveva a Boston.
7568433,ita,"Dove andrà la settimana prossima? ""In Ungheria."""
3543283,ita,Ti ringrazio comunque!
7266127,ita,Mi vieni in mente tu!
3284290,ita,Declinò l'intervista.
4993709,ita,Non mi fa ribrezzo.
5558767,ita,Tom è molto fiero di suo figlio.
5438568,ita,Gli mancherò.
4410708,ita,Non sono molto informato.
3928522,ita,Tom non sembra impegnato.
3149349,ita,Vive per conto suo.
1073116,ita,Bisogna rispettare le regole.
5635407,ita,Tom non riesce a trovarli.
2969479,ita,Tom non fu beccato.
6146410,ita,Li ami veramente?
3390549,ita,Stai facendo i compiti?

6017957,ita,Voglio aspettarle.
3809565,ita,Avete sognato Tom.
3554587,ita,"Sei normale tu, invece?"

3876371,ita,Siamo o non siamo il paese delle meraviglie?
7619048,ita,Andiamo a costruire biblioteche in Germania.
3875074,ita,Lei ama davvero Tom?

3487477,ita,Io ho fatto un errore nei miei calcoli.
7572702,ita,Penso che andrai per svago in Ucraina.

1293386,ita,Il cadavere fu deposto nella bara.
6720456,ita,Hanno il passaporto russo
4506631,ita,Noi non abbiamo piani.
4969853,ita,Mi scioccò.
1367385,ita,Non sono io l'undicesimo?
3020843,ita,Il protagonista è un osservatore neutrale e non prende parte attivamente agli eventi che lo circondano.
5646857,ita,Amavi Tom?
5127960,ita,Bisogna evitare le ripetizioni.
6276652,ita,Siete fregate.
1614106,ita,Mi ripeti chi è tuo padre?
662906,ita,Vorrei un pesce.
7613841,ita,Vado a costruire ponti in Bangladesh?

3827802,ita,Tu non leggi libri in inglese.
3381984,ita,È un pochino di mentalità chiusa?
2190953,ita,Tom è inaffidabile.
3564191,ita,Comprai una macchina fotografica con i suoi accessori.
2020843,ita,Stia lontana da Tom.
5569341,ita,È molto strana.
1280465,ita,Lei riesce a parlare francese.
3943525,ita,Scusa se ho rovinato la foto!
7598312,ita,Non vanno a imparare qualcosa in Spagna.
3009223,ita,Penso che a Tom serva il suo aiuto.

4947345,ita,"Voi vi siete alzati, vero?"
4965879,ita,Mia madre sta preparando la colazione.
6027740,ita,Non potete fermarle?
4178560,ita,Abbiamo molta strada da fare.
3768575,ita,Sarebbe illogica.
3816578,ita,Insultava la gente.
3266518,ita,"Queste leggi contro l'uso eccessivo dei telefoni ci proteggono un po', ma resta centrale una politica di buone maniere, ed educare i giovani a stare con altre persone e comunicare direttamente senza alcuno strumento."
1990041,ita,La sua previsione potrebbe avverarsi.
3841666,ita,Alcuni sono moderati; alcuni sono radicali.
6879375,ita,La persona che nuota nel fiume è mia amica.
6680578,ita,Mi chiedo cosa stia pensando Tom adesso.
6750997,ita,Quello!
1020335,ita,La sig.ra Eichler aveva notoriamente fama di essere severa verso i propri studenti.
3554892,ita,Cosa vorresti che facesse?
6997558,ita,Controllerò i miei messaggi.

6745352,ita,"Di che nazionalità sono i vostri cugini? ""Lettone."""
381156,ita,È inutile parlare con lui.
1339854,ita,Adesso però è molto migliorata.
6866058,ita,Un caffè caldo ci stava come il cacio sui maccheroni.
7618963,ita,Vai a costruire biblioteche in Niger.
7600923,ita,Non andate a cercare qualcosa in Albania.

6205717,ita,Non ci si dovrebbe fidare di lei.
7661767,ita,Andate a costruire basi militari in Lettonia?

6452187,ita,Perché sei tornata così presto?
7681559,ita,Tom amava il suo lavoro.
