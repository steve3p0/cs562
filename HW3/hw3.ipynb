In the second you will train a neural language model to generate new British place names. For the second part, you will find Chapter 17 of the Goldberg text to be a useful reference.\n",

On my laptop, the various networks take on the order of ≈5 minutes to train. Make sure not to wait until the last minute to do this assignment, as you will need to do a fair bit of experimentation and tinkering, and you won't want to find yourself running out of time."

    "$$ \\operatorname*{argmax}_{l} P(l | x ) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be done in a variety of ways. One common (and well-performing) technique is to use trigram character frequencies, or other character-level features (writing system, etc.); some approaches rely on or incorporate word-level features. The difficulty of the task depends on a number of factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How much training data one has from each language of interest (often an issue)\n",
    "* How similar the languages are to one another (Spanish and Italian are more difficult to differentiate than are English and Arabic)\n",
    "* How much [\"code-switching\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code-switching) is present in the language of interest\n",
    "\n",
    "The last point is a major one: many texts of interest (tweets, etc.) contain a mix of languages, which can cause trouble both at the time of _training_ a language identification system as well as at the time of _inference_ (i.e., when you're actually trying to _use_ your system). The problem can be compounded by mixed writing systems: due to limitations of text-entry systems, users of some non-Latin scripts often will often write e.g. Arabic using English orthography. Names of places, brands, individuals, etc. can also cause script-level code switching. Fortunately, for this assignment, you will not need to worry about this issue.\n",

    "\n",
    "The equations above describe character-at-a-time training- starting from the shortest possible prefix of our sequence $\\mathbf{w}$, $\\mathbf{w}_{1:1}$, and continuing up through successively longer prefixes until reaching $\\mathbf{w}_{1:n-1}$, ask the model to predict the next character, accumulating loss with the negative log-likelihood criterion.\n",

Note that in the above equations, $\\mathbf{o}$ will have dimensionality of $(1, n-1, N_{classes})$- in other words, there will be one set of probability estimates for each time point that we have provided the LSTM. PyTorch's `nn.NLLLoss` class can accept input in this shape, and will automatically compute the average loss across the timepoints (and of course will do so a way that keeps the gradients around for correct backpropagation). Training this way can reduce the total number of computations that we need to do in order to train our model.\n",
