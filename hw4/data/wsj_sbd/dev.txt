Pierre Vinken, 61 years old, will join the board as a nonexecutive director Nov. 29.
Mr. Vinken is chairman of Elsevier N.V., the Dutch publishing group.
Rudolph Agnew, 55 years old and former chairman of Consolidated Gold Fields PLC, was named a nonexecutive director of this British industrial conglomerate.
A form of asbestos once used to make Kent cigarette filters has caused a high percentage of cancer deaths among a group of workers exposed to it more than 30 years ago, researchers reported.
The asbestos fiber, crocidolite, is unusually resilient once it enters the lungs, with even brief exposures to it causing symptoms that show up decades later, researchers said.
Lorillard Inc., the unit of New York-based Loews Corp. that makes Kent cigarettes, stopped using crocidolite in its Micronite cigarette filters in 1956.
Although preliminary findings were reported more than a year ago, the latest results appear in today's New England Journal of Medicine, a forum likely to bring new attention to the problem.
A Lorillard spokewoman said, "This is an old story.
We're talking about years ago before anyone heard of asbestos having any questionable properties.
There is no asbestos in our products now."
Neither Lorillard nor the researchers who studied the workers were aware of any research on smokers of the Kent cigarettes.
"We have no useful information on whether users are at risk," said James A. Talcott of Boston's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.
Dr. Talcott led a team of researchers from the National Cancer Institute and the medical schools of Harvard University and Boston University.
The Lorillard spokeswoman said asbestos was used in "very modest amounts" in making paper for the filters in the early 1950s and replaced with a different type of filter in 1956.
From 1953 to 1955, 9.8 billion Kent cigarettes with the filters were sold, the company said.
Among 33 men who worked closely with the substance, 28 have died -- more than three times the expected number.
Four of the five surviving workers have asbestos-related diseases, including three with recently diagnosed cancer.
The total of 18 deaths from malignant mesothelioma, lung cancer and asbestosis was far higher than expected, the researchers said.
"The morbidity rate is a striking finding among those of us who study asbestos-related diseases," said Dr. Talcott.
The percentage of lung cancer deaths among the workers at the West Groton, Mass., paper factory appears to be the highest for any asbestos workers studied in Western industrialized countries, he said.
The plant, which is owned by Hollingsworth & Vose Co., was under contract with Lorillard to make the cigarette filters.
The finding probably will support those who argue that the U.S. should regulate the class of asbestos including crocidolite more stringently than the common kind of asbestos, chrysotile, found in most schools and other buildings, Dr. Talcott said.
The U.S. is one of the few industrialized nations that doesn't have a higher standard of regulation for the smooth, needle-like fibers such as crocidolite that are classified as amphobiles, according to Brooke T. Mossman, a professor of pathlogy at the University of Vermont College of Medicine.
More common chrysotile fibers are curly and are more easily rejected by the body, Dr. Mossman explained.
In July, the Environmental Protection Agency imposed a gradual ban on virtually all uses of asbestos.
By 1997, almost all remaining uses of cancer-causing asbestos will be outlawed.
About 160 workers at a factory that made paper for the Kent filters were exposed to asbestos in the 1950s.
Areas of the factory were particularly dusty where the crocidolite was used.
Workers dumped large burlap sacks of the imported material into a huge bin, poured in cotton and acetate fibers and mechanically mixed the dry fibers in a process used to make filters.
Workers described "clouds of blue dust" that hung over parts of the factory, even though exhaust fans ventilated the area.
"There's no question that some of those workers and managers contracted asbestos-related diseases," said Darrell Phillips, vice president of human resources for Hollingsworth & Vose.
"But you have to recognize that these events took place 35 years ago.
It has no bearing on our work force today.
Yields on money-market mutual funds continued to slide, amid signs that portfolio managers expect further declines in interest rates.
The average seven-day compound yield of the 400 taxable funds tracked by IBC's Money Fund Report eased a fraction of a percentage point to 8.45% from 8.47% for the week ended Tuesday.
Compound yields assume reinvestment of dividends and that the current yield continues for a year.
Average maturity of the funds' investments lengthened by a day to 41 days, the longest since early August, according to Donoghue's.
Longer maturities are thought to indicate declining interest rates because they permit portfolio managers to retain relatively higher rates for a longer period.
Shorter maturities are considered a sign of rising rates because portfolio managers can capture higher rates sooner.
The average maturity for funds open only to institutions, considered by some to be a stronger indicator because those managers watch the market closely, reached a high point for the year -- 33 days.
Nevertheless, said Brenda Malizia Negus, editor of Money Fund Report, yields "may blip up again before they blip down" because of recent rises in short-term interest rates.
The yield on six-month Treasury bills sold at Monday's auction, for example, rose to 8.04% from 7.90%.
Despite recent declines in yields, investors continue to pour cash into money funds.
Assets of the 400 taxable funds grew by $1.5 billion during the latest week, to $352.7 billion.
Typically, money-fund yields beat comparable short-term investments because portfolio managers can vary maturities and go after the highest rates.
The top money funds are currently yielding well over 9%.
Dreyfus World-Wide Dollar, the top-yielding fund, had a seven-day compound yield of 9.37% during the latest week, down from 9.45% a week earlier.
It invests heavily in dollar-denominated securities overseas and is currently waiving management fees, which boosts its yield.
The average seven-day simple yield of the 400 funds was 8.12%, down from 8.14%.
The 30-day simple yield fell to an average 8.19% from 8.22%; the 30-day compound yield slid to an average 8.53% from 8.56%.
J.P. Bolduc, vice chairman of W.R. Grace & Co., which holds a 83.4% interest in this energy-services company, was elected a director.
He succeeds Terrence D. Daniels, formerly a W.R. Grace vice chairman, who resigned.
W.R. Grace holds three of Grace Energy's seven board seats.
Pacific First Financial Corp. said shareholders approved its acquisition by Royal Trustco Ltd. of Toronto for $27 a share, or $212 million.
The thrift holding company said it expects to obtain regulatory approval and complete the transaction by year-end.
McDermott International Inc. said its Babcock & Wilcox unit completed the sale of its Bailey Controls Operations to Finmeccanica S.p. A. for $295 million.
Finmeccanica is an Italian state-owned holding company with interests in the mechanical engineering industry.
Bailey Controls, based in Wickliffe, Ohio, makes computerized industrial controls systems.
It employs 2,700 people and has annual revenue of about $370 million.
The federal government suspended sales of U.S. savings bonds because Congress hasn't lifted the ceiling on government debt.
Until Congress acts, the government hasn't any authority to issue new debt obligations of any kind, the Treasury said.
The government's borrowing authority dropped at midnight Tuesday to $2.80 trillion from $2.87 trillion.
Legislation to lift the debt ceiling is ensnarled in the fight over cutting capital-gains taxes.
The House has voted to raise the ceiling to $3.1 trillion, but the Senate isn't expected to act until next week at the earliest.
The Treasury said the U.S. will default on Nov. 9 if Congress doesn't act by then.
Clark J. Vitulli was named senior vice president and general manager of this U.S. sales and marketing arm of Japanese auto maker Mazda Motor Corp.
In the new position he will oversee Mazda's U.S. sales, service, parts and marketing operations.
Previously, Mr. Vitulli, 43 years old, was general marketing manager of Chrysler Corp.'s Chrysler division.
He had been a sales and marketing executive with Chrysler for 20 years.
When it's time for their biannual powwow, the nation's manufacturing titans typically jet off to the sunny confines of resort towns like Boca Raton and Hot Springs.
Not this year.
The National Association of Manufacturers settled on the Hoosier capital of Indianapolis for its fall board meeting.
And the city decided to treat its guests more like royalty or rock stars than factory owners.
The idea, of course: to prove to 125 corporate decision makers that the buckle on the Rust Belt isn't so rusty after all, that it's a good place for a company to expand.
On the receiving end of the message were officials from giants like Du Pont and Maytag, along with lesser knowns like Trojan Steel and the Valley Queen Cheese Factory.
For starters, the executives joined Mayor William H. Hudnut III for an evening of the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra and a guest pianist-comedian Victor Borge.
Champagne and dessert followed.
The next morning, with a police escort, busloads of executives and their wives raced to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, unimpeded by traffic or red lights.
The governor couldn't make it, so the lieutenant governor welcomed the special guests.
A buffet breakfast was held in the museum, where food and drinks are banned to everyday visitors.
Then, in the guests' honor, the speedway hauled out four drivers, crews and even the official Indianapolis 500 announcer for a 10-lap exhibition race.
After the race, Fortune 500 executives drooled like schoolboys over the cars and drivers.
No dummies, the drivers pointed out they still had space on their machines for another sponsor's name or two.
Back downtown, the execs squeezed in a few meetings at the hotel before boarding the buses again.
This time, it was for dinner and dancing -- a block away.
Under the stars and moons of the renovated Indiana Roof ballroom, nine of the hottest chefs in town fed them Indiana duckling mousseline, lobster consomme, veal mignon and chocolate terrine with a raspberry sauce.
Knowing a tasty -- and free -- meal when they eat one, the executives gave the chefs a standing ovation.
More than a few CEOs say the red-carpet treatment tempts them to return to a heartland city for future meetings.
But for now, they're looking forward to their winter meeting -- Boca in February.
South Korea registered a trade deficit of $101 million in October, reflecting the country's economic sluggishness, according to government figures released Wednesday.
Preliminary tallies by the Trade and Industry Ministry showed another trade deficit in October, the fifth monthly setback this year, casting a cloud on South Korea's export-oriented economy.
Exports in October stood at $5.29 billion, a mere 0.7% increase from a year earlier, while imports increased sharply to $5.39 billion, up 20% from last October.
South Korea's economic boom, which began in 1986, stopped this year because of prolonged labor disputes, trade conflicts and sluggish exports.
Government officials said exports at the end of the year would remain under a government target of $68 billion.
Despite the gloomy forecast, South Korea has recorded a trade surplus of $71 million so far this year.
From January to October, the nation's accumulated exports increased 4% from the same period last year to $50.45 billion.
Imports were at $50.38 billion, up 19%.
Newsweek, trying to keep pace with rival Time magazine, announced new advertising rates for 1990 and said it will introduce a new incentive plan for advertisers.
The new ad plan from Newsweek, a unit of the Washington Post Co., is the second incentive plan the magazine has offered advertisers in three years.
Plans that give advertisers discounts for maintaining or increasing ad spending have become permanent fixtures at the news weeklies and underscore the fierce competition between Newsweek, Time Warner Inc.'s Time magazine, and Mortimer B. Zuckerman's U.S. News & World Report.
Alan Spoon, recently named Newsweek president, said Newsweek's ad rates would increase 5% in January.
A full, four-color page in Newsweek will cost $100,980.
In mid-October, Time magazine lowered its guaranteed circulation rate base for 1990 while not increasing ad page rates; with a lower circulation base, Time's ad rate will be effectively 7.5% higher per subscriber; a full page in Time costs about $120,000.
U.S. News has yet to announce its 1990 ad rates.
Newsweek said it will introduce the Circulation Credit Plan, which awards space credits to advertisers on "renewal advertising."
The magazine will reward with "page bonuses" advertisers who in 1990 meet or exceed their 1989 spending, as long as they spent $325,000 in 1989 and $340,000 in 1990.
Mr. Spoon said the plan is not an attempt to shore up a decline in ad pages in the first nine months of 1989; Newsweek's ad pages totaled 1,620, a drop of 3.2% from last year, according to Publishers Information Bureau.
"What matters is what advertisers are paying per page, and in that department we are doing fine this fall," said Mr. Spoon.
Both Newsweek and U.S. News have been gaining circulation in recent years without heavy use of electronic giveaways to subscribers, such as telephones or watches.
However, none of the big three weeklies recorded circulation gains recently.
According to Audit Bureau of Circulations, Time, the largest newsweekly, had average circulation of 4,393,237, a decrease of 7.3%.
Newsweek's circulation for the first six months of 1989 was 3,288,453, flat from the same period last year.
U.S. News' circulation in the same time was 2,303,328, down 2.6%.
New England Electric System bowed out of the bidding for Public Service Co. of New Hampshire, saying that the risks were too high and the potential payoff too far in the future to justify a higher offer.
The move leaves United Illuminating Co. and Northeast Utilities as the remaining outside bidders for PS of New Hampshire, which also has proposed an internal reorganization plan in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings under which it would remain an independent company.
New England Electric, based in Westborough, Mass., had offered $2 billion to acquire PS of New Hampshire, well below the $2.29 billion value United Illuminating places on its bid and the $2.25 billion Northeast says its bid is worth.
United Illuminating is based in New Haven, Conn., and Northeast is based in Hartford, Conn.
PS of New Hampshire, Manchester, N.H., values its internal reorganization plan at about $2.2 billion.
John Rowe, president and chief executive officer of New England Electric, said the company's return on equity could suffer if it made a higher bid and its forecasts related to PS of New Hampshire -- such as growth in electricity demand and improved operating efficiencies -- didn't come true.
"When we evaluated raising our bid, the risks seemed substantial and persistent over the next five years, and the rewards seemed a long way out.
That got hard to take," he added.
Mr. Rowe also noted that political concerns also worried New England Electric.
No matter who owns PS of New Hampshire, after it emerges from bankruptcy proceedings its rates will be among the highest in the nation, he said.
"That attracts attention...
it was just another one of the risk factors" that led to the company's decision to withdraw from the bidding, he added.
Wilbur Ross Jr. of Rothschild Inc., the financial adviser to the troubled company's equity holders, said the withdrawal of New England Electric might speed up the reorganization process.
The fact that New England proposed lower rate increases -- 4.8% over seven years against around 5.5% boosts proposed by the other two outside bidders -- complicated negotiations with state officials, Mr. Ross asserted.
"Now the field is less cluttered," he added.
Separately, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission turned down for now a request by Northeast seeking approval of its possible purchase of PS of New Hampshire.
Northeast said it would refile its request and still hopes for an expedited review by the FERC so that it could complete the purchase by next summer if its bid is the one approved by the bankruptcy court.
PS of New Hampshire shares closed yesterday at $3.75, off 25 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
Norman Ricken, 52 years old and former president and chief operating officer of Toys "R" Us Inc., and Frederick Deane Jr., 63, chairman of Signet Banking Corp., were elected directors of this consumer electronics and appliances retailing chain.
They succeed Daniel M. Rexinger, retired Circuit City executive vice president, and Robert R. Glauber, U.S. Treasury undersecretary, on the 12-member board.
Commonwealth Edison Co. was ordered to refund about $250 million to its current and former ratepayers for illegal rates collected for cost overruns on a nuclear power plant.
The refund was about $55 million more than previously ordered by the Illinois Commerce Commission and trade groups said it may be the largest ever required of a state or local utility.
State court Judge Richard Curry ordered Edison to make average refunds of about $45 to $50 each to Edison customers who have received electric service since April 1986, including about two million customers who have moved during that period.
Judge Curry ordered the refunds to begin Feb. 1 and said that he wouldn't entertain any appeals or other attempts to block his order by Commonwealth Edison.
"The refund pool... may not be held hostage through another round of appeals," Judge Curry said.
Commonwealth Edison said it is already appealing the underlying commission order and is considering appealing Judge Curry's order.
The exact amount of the refund will be determined next year based on actual collections made until Dec. 31 of this year.
Commonwealth Edison said the ruling could force it to slash its 1989 earnings by $1.55 a share.
For 1988, Commonwealth Edison reported earnings of $737.5 million, or $3.01 a share.
A Commonwealth Edison spokesman said that tracking down the two million customers whose addresses have changed during the past 3 1/2 years would be "an administrative nightmare."
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Commonwealth Edison closed at $38.375, down 12.5 cents.
The $2.5 billion Byron 1 plant near Rockford, Ill., was completed in 1985.
In a disputed 1985 ruling, the Commerce Commission said Commonwealth Edison could raise its electricity rates by $49 million to pay for the plant.
But state courts upheld a challenge by consumer groups to the commission's rate increase and found the rates illegal.
The Illinois Supreme Court ordered the commission to audit Commonwealth Edison's construction expenses and refund any unreasonable expenses.
The utility has been collecting for the plant's construction cost from its 3.1 million customers subject to a refund since 1986.
In August, the commission ruled that between $190 million and $195 million of the plant's construction cost was unreasonable and should be refunded, plus interest.
In his ruling, Judge Curry added an additional $55 million to the commission's calculations.
Last month, Judge Curry set the interest rate on the refund at 9%.
Commonwealth Edison now faces an additional court-ordered refund on its summer/winter rate differential collections that the Illinois Appellate Court has estimated at $140 million.
And consumer groups hope that Judge Curry's Byron 1 order may set a precedent for a second nuclear rate case involving Commonwealth Edison's Braidwood 2 plant.
Commonwealth Edison is seeking about $245 million in rate increases to pay for Braidwood 2.
The commission is expected to rule on the Braidwood 2 case by year end.
Last year Commonwealth Edison had to refund $72.7 million for poor performance of its LaSalle I nuclear plant.
Japan's domestic sales of cars, trucks and buses in October rose 18% from a year earlier to 500,004 units, a record for the month, the Japan Automobile Dealers' Association said.
The strong growth followed year-to-year increases of 21% in August and 12% in September.
The monthly sales have been setting records every month since March.
October sales, compared with the previous month, inched down 0.4%.
Sales of passenger cars grew 22% from a year earlier to 361,376 units.
Sales of medium-sized cars, which benefited from price reductions arising from introduction of the consumption tax, more than doubled to 30,841 units from 13,056 in October 1988.
Texas Instruments Japan Ltd., a unit of Texas Instruments Inc., said it opened a plant in South Korea to manufacture control devices.
The new plant, located in Chinchon about 60 miles from Seoul, will help meet increasing and diversifying demand for control products in South Korea, the company said.
The plant will produce control devices used in motor vehicles and household appliances.
The survival of spinoff Cray Computer Corp. as a fledgling in the supercomputer business appears to depend heavily on the creativity -- and longevity -- of its chairman and chief designer, Seymour Cray.
Not only is development of the new company's initial machine tied directly to Mr. Cray, so is its balance sheet.
Documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on the pending spinoff disclosed that Cray Research Inc. will withdraw the almost $100 million in financing it is providing the new firm if Mr. Cray leaves or if the product-design project he heads is scrapped.
The documents also said that although the 64-year-old Mr. Cray has been working on the project for more than six years, the Cray-3 machine is at least another year away from a fully operational prototype.
Moreover, there have been no orders for the Cray-3 so far, though the company says it is talking with several prospects.
While many of the risks were anticipated when Minneapolis-based Cray Research first announced the spinoff in May, the strings it attached to the financing hadn't been made public until yesterday.
"We didn't have much of a choice," Cray Computer's chief financial officer, Gregory Barnum, said in an interview.
"The theory is that Seymour is the chief designer of the Cray-3, and without him it could not be completed.
Cray Research did not want to fund a project that did not include Seymour."
The documents also said that Cray Computer anticipates needing perhaps another $120 million in financing beginning next September.
But Mr. Barnum called that "a worst-case" scenario.
The filing on the details of the spinoff caused Cray Research stock to jump $2.875 yesterday to close at $38 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
Analysts noted yesterday that Cray Research's decision to link its $98.3 million promissory note to Mr. Cray's presence will complicate a valuation of the new company.
"It has to be considered as an additional risk for the investor," said Gary P. Smaby of Smaby Group Inc., Minneapolis.
"Cray Computer will be a concept stock," he said.
"You either believe Seymour can do it again or you don't."
Besides the designer's age, other risk factors for Mr. Cray's new company include the Cray-3's tricky, unproven chip technology.
The SEC documents describe those chips, which are made of gallium arsenide, as being so fragile and minute they will require special robotic handling equipment.
In addition, the Cray-3 will contain 16 processors -- twice as many as the largest current supercomputer.
Cray Computer also will face intense competition, not only from Cray Research, which has about 60% of the world-wide supercomputer market and which is expected to roll out the C-90 machine, a direct competitor with the Cray-3, in 1991.
The spinoff also will compete with International Business Machines Corp. and Japan's Big Three -- Hitachi Ltd., NEC Corp. and Fujitsu Ltd.
The new company said it believes there are fewer than 100 potential customers for supercomputers priced between $15 million and $30 million -- presumably the Cray-3 price range.
Under terms of the spinoff, Cray Research stockholders are to receive one Cray Computer share for every two Cray Research shares they own in a distribution expected to occur in about two weeks.
No price for the new shares has been set.
Instead, the companies will leave it up to the marketplace to decide.
Cray Computer has applied to trade on Nasdaq.
Analysts calculate Cray Computer's initial book value at about $4.75 a share.
Along with the note, Cray Research is transferring about $53 million in assets, primarily those related to the Cray-3 development, which has been a drain on Cray Research's earnings.
Pro-forma balance sheets clearly show why Cray Research favored the spinoff.
Without the Cray-3 research and development expenses, the company would have been able to report a profit of $19.3 million for the first half of 1989 rather than the $5.9 million it posted.
On the other hand, had it existed then, Cray Computer would have incurred a $20.5 million loss.
Mr. Cray, who couldn't be reached for comment, will work for the new Colorado Springs, Colo., company as an independent contractor -- the arrangement he had with Cray Research.
Regarded as the father of the supercomputer, Mr. Cray was paid $600,000 at Cray Research last year.
At Cray Computer, he will be paid $240,000.
Besides Messrs. Cray and Barnum, other senior management at the company includes Neil Davenport, 47, president and chief executive officer; Joseph M. Blanchard, 37, vice president, engineering; Malcolm A. Hammerton, 40, vice president, software; and Douglas R. Wheeland, 45, vice president, hardware.
All came from Cray Research.
Cray Computer, which currently employs 241 people, said it expects a work force of 450 by the end of 1990.
John R. Stevens, 49 years old, was named senior executive vice president and chief operating officer, both new positions.
He will continue to report to Donald Pardus, president and chief executive officer.
Mr. Stevens was executive vice president of this electric-utility holding company.
Arthur A. Hatch, 59, was named executive vice president of the company.
He was previously president of the company's Eastern Edison Co. unit.
John D. Carney, 45, was named to succeed Mr. Hatch as president of Eastern Edison.
Previously he was vice president of Eastern Edison.
Robert P. Tassinari, 63, was named senior vice president of Eastern Utilities.
He was previously vice president.
The U.S., claiming some success in its trade diplomacy, removed South Korea, Taiwan and Saudi Arabia from a list of countries it is closely watching for allegedly failing to honor U.S. patents, copyrights and other intellectual-property rights.
However, five other countries -- China, Thailand, India, Brazil and Mexico -- will remain on that so-called priority watch list as a result of an interim review, U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills announced.
Under the new U.S. trade law, those countries could face accelerated unfair-trade investigations and stiff trade sanctions if they don't improve their protection of intellectual property by next spring.
Mrs. Hills said many of the 25 countries that she placed under varying degrees of scrutiny have made "genuine progress" on this touchy issue.
She said there is "growing realization" around the world that denial of intellectual-property rights harms all trading nations, and particularly the "creativity and inventiveness of an {offending} country's own citizens."
U.S. trade negotiators argue that countries with inadequate protections for intellectual-property rights could be hurting themselves by discouraging their own scientists and authors and by deterring U.S. high-technology firms from investing or marketing their best products there.
Mrs. Hills lauded South Korea for creating an intellectual-property task force and special enforcement teams of police officers and prosecutors trained to pursue movie and book pirates.
Seoul also has instituted effective search-and-seizure procedures to aid these teams, she said.
Taiwan has improved its standing with the U.S. by initialing a bilateral copyright agreement, amending its trademark law and introducing legislation to protect foreign movie producers from unauthorized showings of their films.
That measure could compel Taipei's growing number of small video-viewing parlors to pay movie producers for showing their films.
Saudi Arabia, for its part, has vowed to enact a copyright law compatible with international standards and to apply the law to computer software as well as to literary works, Mrs. Hills said.
These three countries aren't completely off the hook, though.
They will remain on a lower-priority list that includes 17 other countries.
Those countries -- including Japan, Italy, Canada, Greece and Spain -- are still of some concern to the U.S. but are deemed to pose less-serious problems for American patent and copyright owners than those on the "priority" list.
Gary Hoffman, a Washington lawyer specializing in intellectual-property cases, said the threat of U.S. retaliation, combined with a growing recognition that protecting intellectual property is in a country's own interest, prompted the improvements made by South Korea, Taiwan and Saudi Arabia.
"What this tells us is that U.S. trade law is working," he said.
He said Mexico could be one of the next countries to be removed from the priority list because of its efforts to craft a new patent law.
Mrs. Hills said that the U.S. is still concerned about "disturbing developments in Turkey and continuing slow progress in Malaysia."
She didn't elaborate, although earlier U.S. trade reports have complained of videocassette piracy in Malaysia and disregard for U.S. pharmaceutical patents in Turkey.
The 1988 trade act requires Mrs. Hills to issue another review of the performance of these countries by April 30.
So far, Mrs. Hills hasn't deemed any cases bad enough to merit an accelerated investigation under the so-called special 301 provision of the act.
Argentina said it will ask creditor banks to halve its foreign debt of $64 billion -- the third-highest in the developing world.
The declaration by Economy Minister Nestor Rapanelli is believed to be the first time such an action has been called for by an Argentine official of such stature.
The Latin American nation has paid very little on its debt since early last year.
"Argentina aspires to reach a reduction of 50% in the value of its external debt," Mr. Rapanelli said through his spokesman, Miguel Alurralde.
Mr. Rapanelli met in August with U.S. Assistant Treasury Secretary David Mulford.
Argentine negotiator Carlos Carballo was in Washington and New York this week to meet with banks.
Mr. Rapanelli recently has said the government of President Carlos Menem, who took office July 8, feels a significant reduction of principal and interest is the only way the debt problem may be solved.
But he has not said before that the country wants half the debt forgiven.
THREE COMPUTERS THAT CHANGED the face of personal computing were launched in 1977.
That year the Apple II, Commodore Pet and Tandy TRS-80 came to market.
The computers were crude by today's standards.
Apple II owners, for example, had to use their television sets as screens and stored data on audiocassettes.
But Apple II was a major advance from Apple I, which was built in a garage by Stephen Wozniak and Steven Jobs for hobbyists such as the Homebrew Computer Club.
In addition, the Apple II was an affordable $1,298.
Crude as they were, these early PCs triggered explosive product development in desktop models for the home and office.
Big mainframe computers for business had been around for years.
But the new 1977 PCs -- unlike earlier built-from-kit types such as the Altair, Sol and IMSAI -- had keyboards and could store about two pages of data in their memories.
Current PCs are more than 50 times faster and have memory capacity 500 times greater than their 1977 counterparts.
There were many pioneer PC contributors.
William Gates and Paul Allen in 1975 developed an early language-housekeeper system for PCs, and Gates became an industry billionaire six years after IBM adapted one of these versions in 1981.
Alan F. Shugart, currently chairman of Seagate Technology, led the team that developed the disk drives for PCs.
Dennis Hayes and Dale Heatherington, two Atlanta engineers, were co-developers of the internal modems that allow PCs to share data via the telephone.
IBM, the world leader in computers, didn't offer its first PC until August 1981 as many other companies entered the market.
Today, PC shipments annually total some $38.3 billion world-wide.
F.H. Faulding & Co., an Australian pharmaceuticals company, said its Moleculon Inc. affiliate acquired Kalipharma Inc. for $23 million.
Kalipharma is a New Jersey-based pharmaceuticals concern that sells products under the Purepac label.
Faulding said it owns 33% of Moleculon's voting stock and has an agreement to acquire an additional 19%.
That stake, together with its convertible preferred stock holdings, gives Faulding the right to increase its interest to 70% of Moleculon's voting stock.
Oil production from Australia's Bass Strait fields will be raised by 11,000 barrels a day to about 321,000 barrels with the launch of the Whiting field, the first of five small fields scheduled to be brought into production before the end of 1990.
Esso Australia Ltd., a unit of New York-based Exxon Corp., and Broken Hill Pty. operate the fields in a joint venture.
Esso said the Whiting field started production Tuesday.
Output will be gradually increased until it reaches about 11,000 barrels a day.
The field has reserves of 21 million barrels.
Reserves for the five new fields total 50 million barrels.
The Perch and Dolphin fields are expected to start producing early next year, and the Seahorse and Tarwhine fields later next year.
Esso said the fields were developed after the Australian government decided in 1987 to make the first 30 million barrels from new fields free of excise tax.
R.P. Scherer Corp. said it completed the $10.2 million sale of its Southern Optical subsidiary to a group led by the unit's president, Thomas R. Sloan, and other managers.
Following the acquisition of R.P. Scherer by a buy-out group led by Shearson Lehman Hutton earlier this year, the maker of gelatin capsules decided to divest itself of certain of its non-encapsulating businesses.
The sale of Southern Optical is a part of the program.
The White House said President Bush has approved duty-free treatment for imports of certain types of watches that aren't produced in "significant quantities" in the U.S., the Virgin Islands and other U.S. possessions.
The action came in response to a petition filed by Timex Inc. for changes in the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences for imports from developing nations.
Previously, watch imports were denied such duty-free treatment.
Timex had requested duty-free treatment for many types of watches, covered by 58 different U.S. tariff classifications.
The White House said Mr. Bush decided to grant duty-free status for 18 categories, but turned down such treatment for other types of watches "because of the potential for material injury to watch producers located in the U.S. and the Virgin Islands."
Timex is a major U.S. producer and seller of watches, including low-priced battery-operated watches assembled in the Philippines and other developing nations covered by the U.S. tariff preferences.
U.S. trade officials said the Philippines and Thailand would be the main beneficiaries of the president's action.
Imports of the types of watches that now will be eligible for duty-free treatment totaled about $37.3 million in 1988, a relatively small share of the $1.5 billion in U.S. watch imports that year, according to an aide to U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills.
Magna International Inc.'s chief financial officer, James McAlpine, resigned and its chairman, Frank Stronach, is stepping in to help turn the automotive-parts manufacturer around, the company said.
Mr. Stronach will direct an effort to reduce overhead and curb capital spending "until a more satisfactory level of profit is achieved and maintained," Magna said.
Stephen Akerfeldt, currently vice president finance, will succeed Mr. McAlpine.
An ambitious expansion has left Magna with excess capacity and a heavy debt load as the automotive industry enters a downturn.
The company has reported declines in operating profit in each of the past three years, despite steady sales growth.
Magna recently cut its quarterly dividend in half and the company's Class A shares are wallowing far below their 52-week high of 16.125 Canadian dollars (US$ 13.73).
On the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday, Magna shares closed up 37.5 Canadian cents to C$ 9.625.
Mr. Stronach, founder and controlling shareholder of Magna, resigned as chief executive officer last year to seek, unsuccessfully, a seat in Canada's Parliament.
Analysts said Mr. Stronach wants to resume a more influential role in running the company.
They expect him to cut costs throughout the organization.
The company said Mr. Stronach will personally direct the restructuring, assisted by Manfred Gingl, president and chief executive.
Neither they nor Mr. McAlpine could be reached for comment.
Magna said Mr. McAlpine resigned to pursue a consulting career, with Magna as one of his clients.
Lord Chilver, 63-year-old chairman of English China Clays PLC, was named a nonexecutive director of this British chemical company.
Japanese investors nearly single-handedly bought up two new mortgage securities-based mutual funds totaling $701 million, the U.S. Federal National Mortgage Association said.
The purchases show the strong interest of Japanese investors in U.S. mortgage-based instruments, Fannie Mae's chairman, David O. Maxwell, said at a news conference.
He said more than 90% of the funds were placed with Japanese institutional investors.
The rest went to investors from France and Hong Kong.
Earlier this year, Japanese investors snapped up a similar, $570 million mortgage-backed securities mutual fund.
That fund was put together by Blackstone Group, a New York investment bank.
The latest two funds were assembled jointly by Goldman, Sachs & Co. of the U.S. and Japan's Daiwa Securities Co.
The new, seven-year funds -- one offering a fixed-rate return and the other with a floating-rate return linked to the London interbank offered rate -- offer two key advantages to Japanese investors.
First, they are designed to eliminate the risk of prepayment -- mortgage-backed securities can be retired early if interest rates decline, and such prepayment forces investors to redeploy their money at lower rates.
Second, they channel monthly mortgage payments into semiannual payments, reducing the administrative burden on investors.
By addressing those problems, Mr. Maxwell said, the new funds have become "extremely attractive to Japanese and other investors outside the U.S.."
Such devices have boosted Japanese investment in mortgage-backed securities to more than 1% of the $900 billion in such instruments outstanding, and their purchases are growing at a rapid rate.
They also have become large purchasers of Fannie Mae's corporate debt, buying $2.4 billion in Fannie Mae bonds during the first nine months of the year, or almost a tenth of the total amount issued.
James L. Pate, 54-year-old executive vice president, was named a director of this oil concern, expanding the board to 14 members.
LTV Corp. said a federal bankruptcy court judge agreed to extend until March 8, 1990, the period in which the steel, aerospace and energy products company has the exclusive right to file a reorganization plan.
The company is operating under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code, giving it court protection from creditors' lawsuits while it attempts to work out a plan to pay its debts.
Italian chemical giant Montedison S.p.A., through its Montedison Acquisition N.V. indirect unit, began its $37-a-share tender offer for all the common shares outstanding of Erbamont N.V., a maker of pharmaceuticals incorporated in the Netherlands.
The offer, advertised in today's editions of The Wall Street Journal, is scheduled to expire at the end of November.
Montedison currently owns about 72% of Erbamont's common shares outstanding.
The offer is being launched pursuant to a previously announced agreement between the companies.
Japan's reserves of gold, convertible foreign currencies, and special drawing rights fell by a hefty $1.82 billion in October to $84.29 billion, the Finance Ministry said.
The total marks the sixth consecutive monthly decline.
The protracted downturn reflects the intensity of Bank of Japan yen-support intervention since June, when the U.S. currency temporarily surged above the 150.00 yen level.
The announcement follows a sharper $2.2 billion decline in the country's foreign reserves in September to $86.12 billion.
Pick a country, any country.
It's the latest investment craze sweeping Wall Street: a rash of new closed-end country funds, those publicly traded portfolios that invest in stocks of a single foreign country.
No fewer than 24 country funds have been launched or registered with regulators this year, triple the level of all of 1988, according to Charles E. Simon & Co., a Washington-based research firm.
The turf recently has ranged from Chile to Austria to Portugal.
Next week, the Philippine Fund's launch will be capped by a visit by Philippine President Corazon Aquino -- the first time a head of state has kicked off an issue at the Big Board here.
The next province?
"Anything's possible -- how about the New Guinea Fund?" quips George Foot, a managing partner at Newgate Management Associates of Northampton, Mass.
The recent explosion of country funds mirrors the "closed-end fund mania" of the 1920s, Mr. Foot says, when narrowly focused funds grew wildly popular.
They fell into oblivion after the 1929 crash.
Unlike traditional open-end mutual funds, most of these one-country portfolios are the "closed-end" type, issuing a fixed number of shares that trade publicly.
The surge brings to nearly 50 the number of country funds that are or soon will be listed in New York or London.
These funds now account for several billions of dollars in assets.
"People are looking to stake their claims" now before the number of available nations runs out, says Michael Porter, an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co., New York.
Behind all the hoopla is some heavy-duty competition.
As individual investors have turned away from the stock market over the years, securities firms have scrambled to find new products that brokers find easy to sell.
And the firms are stretching their nets far and wide to do it.
Financial planners often urge investors to diversify and to hold a smattering of international securities.
And many emerging markets have outpaced more mature markets, such as the U.S. and Japan.
Country funds offer an easy way to get a taste of foreign stocks without the hard research of seeking out individual companies.
But it doesn't take much to get burned.
Political and currency gyrations can whipsaw the funds.
Another concern: The funds' share prices tend to swing more than the broader market.
When the stock market dropped nearly 7% Oct. 13, for instance, the Mexico Fund plunged about 18% and the Spain Fund fell 16%.
And most country funds were clobbered more than most stocks after the 1987 crash.
What's so wild about the funds' frenzy right now is that many are trading at historically fat premiums to the value of their underlying portfolios.
After trading at an average discount of more than 20% in late 1987 and part of last year, country funds currently trade at an average premium of 6%.
The reason: Share prices of many of these funds this year have climbed much more sharply than the foreign stocks they hold.
It's probably worth paying a premium for funds that invest in markets that are partially closed to foreign investors, such as South Korea, some specialists say.
But some European funds recently have skyrocketed; Spain Fund has surged to a startling 120% premium.
It has been targeted by Japanese investors as a good long-term play tied to 1992's European economic integration.
And several new funds that aren't even fully invested yet have jumped to trade at big premiums.
"I'm very alarmed to see these rich valuations," says Smith Barney's Mr. Porter.
The newly fattened premiums reflect the increasingly global marketing of some country funds, Mr. Porter suggests.
Unlike many U.S. investors, those in Asia or Europe seeking foreign-stock exposure may be less resistant to paying higher prices for country funds.
"There may be an international viewpoint cast on the funds listed here," Mr. Porter says.
Nonetheless, plenty of U.S. analysts and money managers are aghast at the lofty trading levels of some country funds.
They argue that U.S. investors often can buy American depositary receipts on the big stocks in many funds; these so-called ADRs represent shares of foreign companies traded in the U.S..
That way investors can essentially buy the funds without paying the premium.
For people who insist on jumping in now to buy the funds, Newgate's Mr. Foot says: "The only advice I have for these folks is that those who come to the party late had better be ready to leave quickly.
The U.S. and Soviet Union are holding technical talks about possible repayment by Moscow of $188 million in pre-Communist Russian debts owed to the U.S. government, the State Department said.
If the debts are repaid, it could clear the way for Soviet bonds to be sold in the U.S..
However, after two meetings with the Soviets, a State Department spokesman said that it's "too early to say" whether that will happen.
Coincident with the talks, the State Department said it has permitted a Soviet bank to open a New York branch.
The branch of the Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs was approved last spring and opened in July.
But a Soviet bank here would be crippled unless Moscow found a way to settle the $188 million debt, which was lent to the country's short-lived democratic Kerensky government before the Communists seized power in 1917.
Under a 1934 law, the Johnson Debt Default Act, as amended, it's illegal for Americans to extend credit to countries in default to the U.S. government, unless they are members of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.
The U.S.S.R. belongs to neither organization.
Moscow has settled pre-1917 debts with other countries in recent years at less than face value.
The State Department stressed the pre-1933 debts as the key to satisfying the Johnson Act.
But the Soviets might still face legal obstacles to raising money in the U.S. until they settle hundreds of millions of dollars in additional debt still outstanding from the World War II lend-lease program.
In another reflection that the growth of the economy is leveling off, the government said that orders for manufactured goods and spending on construction failed to rise in September.
Meanwhile, the National Association of Purchasing Management said its latest survey indicated that the manufacturing economy contracted in October for the sixth consecutive month.
Its index inched up to 47.6% in October from 46% in September.
Any reading below 50% suggests the manufacturing sector is generally declining.
The purchasing managers, however, also said that orders turned up in October after four months of decline.
Factories booked $236.74 billion in orders in September, nearly the same as the $236.79 billion in August, the Commerce Department said.
If not for a 59.6% surge in orders for capital goods by defense contractors, factory orders would have fallen 2.1%.
In a separate report, the department said construction spending ran at an annual rate of $415.6 billion, not significantly different from the $415.8 billion reported for August.
Private construction spending was down, but government building activity was up.
The figures in both reports were adjusted to remove the effects of usual seasonal patterns, but weren't adjusted for inflation.
Kenneth Mayland, economist for Society Corp., a Cleveland bank, said demand for exports of factory goods is beginning to taper off.
At the same time, the drop in interest rates since the spring has failed to revive the residential construction industry.
"What sector is stepping forward to pick up the slack?" he asked.
"I draw a blank."
By most measures, the nation's industrial sector is now growing very slowly -- if at all.
Factory payrolls fell in September.
So did the Federal Reserve Board's industrial-production index.
Yet many economists aren't predicting that the economy is about to slip into recession.
They cite a lack of "imbalances" that provide early warning signals of a downturn.
Inventories are closely watched for such clues, for instance.
Economists say a buildup in inventories can provoke cutbacks in production that can lead to a recession.
But yesterday's factory orders report had good news on that front: it said factory inventories fell 0.1% in September, the first decline since February 1987.
"This conforms to the `soft landing' scenario," said Elliott Platt, an economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp.
"I don't see any signs that inventories are excessive."
A soft landing is an economic slowdown that eases inflation without leading to a recession.
The department said orders for nondurable goods -- those intended to last fewer than three years -- fell 0.3% in September to $109.73 billion after climbing 0.9% the month before.
Orders for durable goods were up 0.2% to $127.03 billion after rising 3.9% the month before.
The department previously estimated that durable-goods orders fell 0.1% in September.
Factory shipments fell 1.6% to $234.4 billion after rising 5.4% in August.
Shipments have been relatively level since January, the Commerce Department noted.
Manufacturers' backlogs of unfilled orders rose 0.5% in September to $497.34 billion, helped by strength in the defense capital goods sector.
Excluding these orders, backlogs declined 0.3%.
In its construction spending report, the Commerce Department said residential construction, which accounts for nearly half of all construction spending, was off 0.9% in September to an annual rate of $191.9 billion.
David Berson, economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association, predicted the drop in interest rates eventually will boost spending on single-family homes, but probably not until early next year.
Spending on private, nonresidential construction was off 2.6% to an annual rate of $99.1 billion with no sector showing strength.
Government construction spending rose 4.3% to $88 billion.
After adjusting for inflation, the Commerce Department said construction spending didn't change in September.
For the first nine months of the year, total construction spending ran about 2% above last year's level.
The government's construction spending figures contrast with a report issued earlier in the week by McGraw-Hill Inc.'s F.W. Dodge Group.
Dodge reported an 8% increase in construction contracts awarded in September.
The goverment counts money as it is spent; Dodge counts contracts when they are awarded.
The government includes money spent on residential renovation; Dodge doesn't.
Although the purchasing managers' index continues to indicate a slowing economy, it isn't signaling an imminent recession, said Robert Bretz, chairman of the association's survey committee and director of materials management at Pitney Bowes Inc., Stamford, Conn.
He said the index would have to be in the low 40% range for several months to be considered a forecast of recession.
The report offered new evidence that the nation's export growth, though still continuing, may be slowing.
Only 19% of the purchasing managers reported better export orders in October, down from 27% in September.
And 8% said export orders were down last month, compared with 6% the month before.
The purhasing managers' report also added evidence that inflation is under control.
For the fifth consecutive month, purchasing managers said prices for the goods they purchased fell.
The decline was even steeper than in September.
They also said that vendors were delivering goods more quickly in October than they had for each of the five previous months.
Economists consider that a sign that inflationary pressures are abating.
When demand is stronger than suppliers can handle and delivery times lengthen, prices tend to rise.
The purchasing managers' report is based on data provided by more than 250 purchasing executives.
Each of the survey's indicators gauges the difference between the number of purchasers reporting improvement in a particular area and the number reporting a worsening.
For the first time, the October survey polled members on imports.
It found that of the 73% who import, 10% said they imported more in October and 12% said they imported less than the previous month.
While acknowledging one month's figures don't prove a trend, Mr. Bretz said, "It does lead you to suspect imports are going down, or at least not increasing that much."
Items listed as being in short supply numbered only about a dozen, but they included one newcomer: milk and milk powder.
"It's an odd thing to put on the list," Mr. Bretz noted.
He said that for the second month in a row, food processors reported a shortage of nonfat dry milk.
They blamed increased demand for dairy products at a time of exceptionally high U.S. exports of dry milk, coupled with very low import quotas.

Judging from the Americana in Haruki Murakami's "A Wild Sheep Chase" (Kodansha, 320 pages, $18.95), baby boomers on both sides of the Pacific have a lot in common.
Although set in Japan, the novel's texture is almost entirely Western, especially American.
Characters drink Salty Dogs, whistle "Johnny B. Goode" and watch Bugs Bunny reruns.
They read Mickey Spillane and talk about Groucho and Harpo.
They worry about their careers, drink too much and suffer through broken marriages and desultory affairs.
This is Japan?
For an American reader, part of the charm of this engaging novel should come in recognizing that Japan isn't the buttoned-down society of contemporary American lore.
It's also refreshing to read a Japanese author who clearly doesn't belong to the self-aggrandizing "we-Japanese" school of writers who perpetuate the notion of the unique Japanese, unfathomable by outsiders.
If "A Wild Sheep Chase" carries an implicit message for international relations, it's that the Japanese are more like us than most of us think.
That's not to say that the nutty plot of "A Wild Sheep Chase" is rooted in reality.
It's imaginative and often funny.
A disaffected, hard-drinking, nearly-30 hero sets off for snow country in search of an elusive sheep with a star on its back at the behest of a sinister, erudite mobster with a Stanford degree.
He has in tow his prescient girlfriend, whose sassy retorts mark her as anything but a docile butterfly.
Along the way, he meets a solicitous Christian chauffeur who offers the hero God's phone number; and the Sheep Man, a sweet, roughhewn figure who wears -- what else -- a sheepskin.
The 40-year-old Mr. Murakami is a publishing sensation in Japan.
A more recent novel, "Norwegian Wood" (every Japanese under 40 seems to be fluent in Beatles lyrics), has sold more than four million copies since Kodansha published it in 1987.
But he is just one of several youthful writers -- Tokyo's brat pack -- who are dominating the best-seller charts in Japan.
Their books are written in idiomatic, contemporary language and usually carry hefty dashes of Americana.
In Robert Whiting's "You Gotta Have Wa" (Macmillan, 339 pages, $17.95), the Beatles give way to baseball, in the Nipponese version we would be hard put to call a "game."
As Mr. Whiting describes it, Nipponese baseball is a "mirror of Japan's fabled virtues of hard work and harmony."
"Wa" is Japanese for "team spirit" and Japanese ballplayers have miles and miles of it.
A player's commitment to practice and team image is as important as his batting average.
Polls once named Tokyo Giants star Tatsunori Hara, a "humble, uncomplaining, obedient soul," as the male symbol of Japan.
But other than the fact that besuboru is played with a ball and a bat, it's unrecognizable: Fans politely return foul balls to stadium ushers; the strike zone expands depending on the size of the hitter; ties are permitted -- even welcomed -- since they honorably sidestep the shame of defeat; players must abide by strict rules of conduct even in their personal lives -- players for the Tokyo Giants, for example, must always wear ties when on the road.
"You Gotta Have Wa" is the often amusing chronicle of how American ballplayers, rationed to two per team, fare in Japan.
Despite the enormous sums of money they're paid to stand up at a Japanese plate, a good number decide it's not worth it and run for home.
"Funny Business" (Soho, 228 pages, $17.95) by Gary Katzenstein is anything but.
It's the petulant complaint of an impudent American whom Sony hosted for a year while he was on a Luce Fellowship in Tokyo -- to the regret of both parties.
In sometimes amusing, more often supercilious, even vicious passages, Mr. Katzenstein describes how Sony invades even the most mundane aspects of its workers' lives -- at the regimented office, where employees are assigned lunch partners -- and at "home" in the austere company dormitory run by a prying caretaker.
Some of his observations about Japanese management style are on the mark.
It's probably true that many salarymen put in unproductive overtime just for the sake of solidarity, that the system is so hierarchical that only the assistant manager can talk to the manager and the manager to the general manager, and that Sony was chary of letting a young, short-term American employee take on any responsibility.
All of this must have been enormously frustrating to Mr. Katzenstein, who went to Sony with degrees in business and computer science and was raring to invent another Walkman.
But Sony ultimately took a lesson from the American management books and fired Mr. Katzenstein, after he committed the social crime of making an appointment to see the venerable Akio Morita, founder of Sony.
It's a shame their meeting never took place.
Mr. Katzenstein certainly would have learned something, and it's even possible Mr. Morita would have too.

More and more corners of the globe are becoming free of tobacco smoke.
In Singapore, a new law requires smokers to put out their cigarettes before entering restaurants, department stores and sports centers or face a $250 fine.
Discos and private clubs are exempt from the ban, and smoking will be permitted in bars except during meal hours, an official said.
Singapore already bans smoking in all theaters, buses, public elevators, hospitals and fast-food restaurants.
In Malaysia, Siti Zaharah Sulaiman, a deputy minister in the prime minister's office, launched a "No-Smoking Week" at the Mara Institute of Technology near Kuala Lumpur and urged other schools to ban on-campus smoking.
South Korea has different concerns.
In Seoul, officials began visiting about 26,000 cigarette stalls to remove illegal posters and signboards advertising imported cigarettes.
South Korea has opened its market to foreign cigarettes but restricts advertising to designated places.
A marketing study indicates that Hong Kong consumers are the most materialistic in the 14 major markets where the survey was carried out.
The study by the Backer Spielvogel Bates ad agency also found that the colony's consumers feel more pressured than those in any of the other surveyed markets, which include the U.S. and Japan.
The survey found that nearly half of Hong Kong consumers espouse what it identified as materialistic values, compared with about one-third in Japan and the U.S..
More than three in five said they are under a great deal of stress most of the time, compared with less than one in two U.S. consumers and one in four in Japan.
The Thai cabinet endorsed Finance Minister Pramual Sabhavasu's proposal to build a $19 million conference center for a joint meeting of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund two years from now.
The meeting, which is expected to draw 20,000 to Bangkok, was going to be held at the Central Plaza Hotel, but the government balked at the hotel's conditions for undertaking necessary expansion.
A major concern about the current plan is whether the new center can be built in such a short time.
Yasser Arafat has written to the chairman of the International Olympic Committee asking him to back a Palestinian bid to join the committee, the Palestine Liberation Organization news agency WAFA said.
An official of the Palestinian Olympic Committee said the committee first applied for membership in 1979 and renewed its application in August of this year.
The PLO in recent months has been trying to join international organizations but failed earlier this year to win membership in the World Health Organization and the World Tourism Organization.
A Beijing food-shop assistant has become the first mainland Chinese to get AIDS through sex, the People's Daily said.
It said the man, whom it did not name, had been found to have the disease after hospital tests.
Once the disease was confirmed, all the man's associates and family were tested, but none have so far been found to have AIDS, the newspaper said.
The man had for a long time had "a chaotic sex life," including relations with foreign men, the newspaper said.
The Polish government increased home electricity charges by 150% and doubled gas prices.
The official news agency PAP said the increases were intended to bring unrealistically low energy charges into line with production costs and compensate for a rise in coal prices.
In happier news, South Korea, in establishing diplomatic ties with Poland yesterday, announced $450 million in loans to the financially strapped Warsaw government.
In a victory for environmentalists, Hungary's parliament terminated a multibillion-dollar River Danube dam being built by Austrian firms.
The Nagymaros dam was designed to be twinned with another dam, now nearly complete, 100 miles upstream in Czechoslovakia.
In ending Hungary's part of the project, Parliament authorized Prime Minister Miklos Nemeth to modify a 1977 agreement with Czechoslovakia, which still wants the dam to be built.
Mr. Nemeth said in parliament that Czechoslovakia and Hungary would suffer environmental damage if the twin dams were built as planned.
Czechoslovakia said in May it could seek $2 billion from Hungary if the twindam contract were broken.
The Czech dam can't be operated solely at peak periods without the Nagymaros project.

After years of decline, weddings in France showed a 2.2% upturn last year, with 6,000 more couples exchanging rings in 1988 than in the previous year, the national statistics office said.
But the number of weddings last year -- 271,124 -- was still well below the 400,000 registered in 1972, the last year of increasing marriages.
BRAMALEA Ltd. said it agreed to issue 100 million Canadian dollars (US$ 85.1 million) of 10.5% senior debentures due Nov. 30, 1999, together with 100,000 bond purchase warrants.
The Toronto-based real estate concern said each bond warrant entitles the holder to buy C$ 1,000 principal amount of debentures at par plus accrued interest to the date of purchase.
The warrants expire Nov. 30, 1990.
The issue will be swapped into fixed-rate U.S. dollars at a rate the company said is less than 9%; a spokesman declined to elaborate.
Lead underwriters for the issue are Scotia McLeod Inc. and RBC Dominion Securities Inc., both Toronto-based investment dealers.
Bramalea said it expects to complete the issue by the end of the month.
As an actor, Charles Lane isn't the inheritor of Charlie Chaplin's spirit.
Steve Martin has already laid his claim to that.
But it is Mr. Lane, as movie director, producer and writer, who has been obsessed with refitting Chaplin's Little Tramp in a contemporary way.
In 1976, as a film student at the Purchase campus of the State University of New York, Mr. Lane shot "A Place in Time," a 36-minute black-and-white film about a sketch artist, a man of the streets.
Now, 13 years later, Mr. Lane has revived his Artist in a full-length movie called "Sidewalk Stories," a poignant piece of work about a modern-day tramp.
Of course, if the film contained dialogue, Mr. Lane's Artist would be called a homeless person.
So would the Little Tramp, for that matter.
I say "contained dialogue" because "Sidewalk Stories" isn't really silent at all.
Composer Marc Marder, a college friend of Mr. Lane's who earns his living playing the double bass in classical music ensembles, has prepared an exciting, eclectic score that tells you what the characters are thinking and feeling far more precisely than intertitles, or even words, would.
Much of Mr. Lane's film takes a highly romanticized view of life on the streets (though probably no more romanticized than Mr. Chaplin's notion of the Tramp as the good-hearted free spirit).
Filmed in lovely black and white by Bill Dill, the New York streets of "Sidewalk Stories" seem benign.
On Wall Street men and women walk with great purpose, noticing one another only when they jostle for cabs.
The Artist hangs out in Greenwich Village, on a strip of Sixth Avenue populated by jugglers, magicians and other good-natured hustlers.
The Artist has his routine.
He spends his days sketching passers-by, or trying to.
At night he returns to the condemned building he calls home.
His life, including his skirmishes with a competing sketch artist, seems carefree.
He is his own man.
Then, just as the Tramp is given a blind girl to cure in "City Lights," the Artist is put in charge of returning a two-year-old waif (Nicole Alysia), whose father has been murdered by thugs, to her mother.
This cute child turns out to be a blessing and a curse.
She gives the Artist a sense of purpose, but also alerts him to the serious inadequacy of his vagrant life.
The beds at the Bowery Mission seem far drearier when he has to tuck a little girl into one of them at night.
To further load the stakes, Mr. Lane dreamed up a highly improbable romance for the Artist, with a young woman who owns her own children's shop and who lives in an expensive high-rise apartment building.
This story line might resonate more strongly if Mr. Lane had as strong a presence in front of the camera as he does behind it.
Mr. Lane's final purpose isn't to glamorize the Artist's vagabond existence.
He has a point he wants to make, and he makes it, with a great deal of force.
The movie ends with sound, the sound of street people talking, and there isn't anything whimsical or enviable in those rough, beaten voices.
The French film maker Claude Chabrol has managed another kind of weird achievement with his "Story of Women."
He has made a harsh, brilliant picture -- one that's captivating -- about a character who, viewed from the most sympathetic angle, would seem disagreeable.
Yet this woman, Marie-Louise Giraud, carries historical significance, both as one of the last women to be executed in France and as a symbol of the Vichy government's hypocrisy.
While Vichy collaborated with the Germans during World War II in the deaths of thousands of Resistance fighters and Jews, its officials needed a diversionary symbolic traitor.
Marie-Louise, a small-time abortionist, was their woman.
She became an abortionist accidentally, and continued because it enabled her to buy jam, cocoa and other war-rationed goodies.
She was untrained and, in one botched job killed a client.
Her remorse was shallow and brief.
Although she was kind and playful to her children, she was dreadful to her war-damaged husband; she openly brought her lover into their home.
As presented by Mr. Chabrol, and played with thin-lipped intensity by Isabelle Huppert, Marie-Louise (called Marie Latour in the film) was not a nice person.
But she didn't deserve to have her head chopped off.
There is very little to recommend "Old Gringo," a confused rendering of the Carlos Fuentes novel of the Mexican Revolution.
Most of the picture is taken up with endless scenes of many people either fighting or eating and drinking to celebrate victory.
I mention the picture only because many bad movies have a bright spot, and this one has Gregory Peck, in a marvelously loose and energetic portrayal of an old man who wants to die the way he wants to die.

Boeing Co. said it is discussing plans with three of its regular Japanese suppliers to possibly help build a larger version of its popular 767 twin-jet.
The discussions are still in preliminary stages, and the specific details haven't been worked out between the Seattle aerospace company and Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd., Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. and Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd.
The three Japanese companies build the body sections of the 767, accounting for a combined 15% of the aircraft.
Japanese press reports have speculated that the Japanese contribution could rise to between 20% and 25% under the new program.
If Boeing goes ahead with the larger 767, the plane could hit the market in the mid-1990s.
This is the year the negative ad, for years a secondary presence in most political campaigns, became the main event.
The irony is that the attack commercial, after getting a boost in last year's presidential campaign, has come of age in an off-off election year with only a few contests scattered across the country.
But in the three leading political contests of 1989, the negative ads have reached new levels of hostility, raising fears that this kind of mudslinging, empty of significant issues, is ushering in a new era of campaigns without content.
"Now," says Joseph Napolitan, a pioneer in political television, "the idea is to attack first, last and always."
A trend that started with the first stirrings of politics, accelerated with the dawn of the television age and became a sometimes-tawdry art form in 1988, has reached an entirely new stage.
"To get people's attention these days," says Douglas Bailey, a political consultant, "your TV ad needs to be bold and entertaining, and, more often than not, that means confrontational.
And, unlike a few years ago, you don't even have to worry whether the ad is truthful."
In 1989, as often as not, the principal fights in the major campaigns are prompted by the ads themselves.
The screen fills with a small, tight facial shot of David Dinkins, Democratic candidate for mayor of New York City.
"David Dinkins failed to file his income taxes for four straight years," says a disembodied male voice.
And then this television commercial, paid for by Republican Rudolph Giuliani's campaign and produced by Roger Ailes, the master of negative TV ads, really gets down to business.
Mr. Dinkins, the ad charges, also failed to report his campaign contributions accurately, hid his links to a failing insurance company and paid a convicted kidnapper "through a phony organization with no members, no receipts and no office."
"David Dinkins," says the kicker, "Why does he always wait until he's caught?"
"Nasty innuendoes," says John Siegal, Mr. Dinkins's issues director, "designed to prosecute a case of political corruption that simply doesn't exist."
Stung by the Giuliani ads, Mr. Dinkins's TV consultants, Robert Shrum and David Doak, finally unleashed a negative ad of their own.
The screen shows two distorted, unrecognizable photos, presumably of two politicians.
"Compare two candidates for mayor," says the announcer.
"One says he's for banning cop-killer bullets.
The other has opposed a ban on cop-killer bullets.
One claims he's pro-choice.
The other has opposed a woman's right to choose."
"Funny thing," says the kicker, "both these candidates are named Rudolph Giuliani."
Who's telling the truth?
Everybody -- and nobody.
It's a classic situation of ads that are true but not always fully accurate.
Mr. Dinkins did fail to file his income taxes for four years, but he insists he voluntarily admitted the "oversight" when he was being considered for a city job.
He was on the board of an insurance company with financial problems, but he insists he made no secret of it.
The city's Campaign Finance Board has refused to pay Mr. Dinkins $95,142 in matching funds because his campaign records are incomplete.
The campaign has blamed these reporting problems on computer errors.
And, says Mr. Dinkins, he didn't know the man his campaign paid for a get-out-the-vote effort had been convicted of kidnapping.
But, say Mr. Dinkins's managers, he did have an office and his organization did have members.
Mr. Giuliani's campaign chairman, Peter Powers, says the Dinkins ad is "deceptive."
The other side, he argues, "knows Giuliani has always been pro-choice, even though he has personal reservations.
They know he is generally opposed to cop-killer bullets, but that he had some reservations about the language in the legislation."
Democratic Lt. Gov. Douglas Wilder opened his gubernatorial battle with Republican Marshall Coleman with an abortion commercial produced by Frank Greer that analysts of every political persuasion agree was a tour de force.
Against a shot of Monticello superimposed on an American flag, an announcer talks about the "strong tradition of freedom and individual liberty" that Virginians have nurtured for generations.
Then, just as an image of the statue of Thomas Jefferson dissolves from the screen, the announcer continues: "On the issue of abortion, Marshall Coleman wants to take away your right to choose and give it to the politicians."
That commercial -- which said Mr. Coleman wanted to take away the right of abortion "even in cases of rape and incest," a charge Mr. Coleman denies -- changed the dynamics of the campaign, transforming it, at least in part, into a referendum on abortion.
The ad prompted Mr. Coleman, the former Virginia attorney general, to launch a series of advertisements created by Bob Goodman and designed to shake Mr. Wilder's support among the very women who were attracted by the abortion ad.
The Coleman counterattack featured a close-up of a young woman in shadows and the ad suggested that she was recalling an unpleasant courtroom ordeal.
A voice says, "C'mon, now, don't you have boyfriends?"
Then an announcer interjects: "It was Douglas Wilder who introduced a bill to force rape victims age 13 and younger to be interrogated about their private lives by lawyers for accused rapists.
So the next time Mr. Wilder talks about the rights of women, ask him about this law he tried to pass."
Mr. Wilder did introduce such legislation 17 years ago, but he did so at the request of a constituent, a common legislative technique used by lawmakers.
The legislation itself noted that it was introduced "by request," and in 1983 Mr. Wilder introduced a bill to protect rape victims from unfounded interrogation.
"People have grown tired of these ads and Coleman has gotten the stigma of being a negative campaigner," says Mark Rozell, a political scientist at Mary Washington College.
"Wilder has managed to get across the idea that Coleman will say anything to get elected governor and -- more important -- has been able to put the onus for all the negative campaigning on Coleman."
Mr. Coleman said this week that he would devote the remainder of the political season to positive campaigning, but the truce lasted only hours.
By Tuesday night, television stations were carrying new ads featuring Mr. Coleman himself raising questions about Mr. Wilder's sensitivity to rape victims.
The attacks began when Democratic Rep. James Florio aired an ad featuring a drawing of Pinocchio and a photograph of Mr. Florio's rival, Republican Rep. Jim Courter.
"Remember Pinocchio?" says a female voice.
"Consider Jim Courter."
And then this commercial, produced by Bob Squier, gets down to its own mean and dirty business.
Pictures of rusted oil drums swim into focus, and the female voice purrs, "That hazardous waste on his {Mr. Courter's} property -- the neighbors are suing for consumer fraud."
And the nose on Mr. Courter's face grows.
The only fraud involved, cry Mr. Courter's partisans, is the Florio commercial itself, and so the Courter campaign has responded with its own Pinocchio commercial, produced by Mr. Ailes.
In this one, the screen fills with photographs of both candidates.
"Who's really lying?" asks a female voice.
"Florio's lying," the voice goes on, because "the barrel on Courter's land... contained heating oil, was cleaned up and caused no pollution."
Mr. Courter's long nose shrinks while Mr. Florio's grows.
Who's telling the truth?
Stephen Salmore, a political scientist at New Jersey's Eagleton Institute, says it's another example of an ad that's true but not fully accurate.
Barrels were dumped on the Courter property, a complaint was made, but there is no evidence the barrels were a serious threat to the environment.
Even so, according to Mr. Salmore, the ad was "devastating" because it raised questions about Mr. Courter's credibility.
But it's building on a long tradition.
In 1966, on route to a re-election rout of Democrat Frank O'Connor, GOP Gov. Nelson Rockefeller of New York appeared in person saying, "If you want to keep the crime rates high, O'Connor is your man."
A seat on the Chicago Board of Trade was sold for $350,000, down $16,000 from the previous sale last Friday.
Seats currently are quoted at $331,000, bid, and $350,000, asked.
The record price for a full membership on the exchange is $550,000, set Aug. 31, 1987.
Japanese investment in Southeast Asia is propelling the region toward economic integration.
Interviews with analysts and business people in the U.S. suggest that Japanese capital may produce the economic cooperation that Southeast Asian politicians have pursued in fits and starts for decades.
But Japan's power in the region also is sparking fears of domination and posing fresh policy questions.
The flow of Japanese funds has set in motion "a process whereby these economies will be knitted together by the great Japanese investment machine," says Robert Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International Corp.
In the past five years, Japanese companies have tripled their commitments in Asia to $5.57 billion.
In Thailand, for example, the government's Board of Investment approved $705.6 million of Japanese investment in 1988, 10 times the U.S. investment figure for the year.
Japan's commitment in Southeast Asia also includes steep increases in foreign assistance and trade.
Asia's other cash-rich countries are following Japan's lead and pumping capital into the region.
In Taiwan and South Korea, rising wages are forcing manufacturers to seek other overseas sites for labor-intensive production.
These nations, known as Asia's "little tigers," also are contributing to Southeast Asia's integration, but their influence will remain subordinate to Japan's.
For recipient countries such as Thailand and Malaysia, the investment will provide needed jobs and spur growth.
But Asian nations' harsh memories of their military domination by Japan in the early part of this century make them fearful of falling under Japanese economic hegemony now.
Because of budget constraints in Washington, the U.S. encourages Japan to share economic burdens in the region.
But it resists yielding political ground.
In the coming decade, analysts say, U.S.-Japanese relations will be tested as Tokyo comes to terms with its new status as the region's economic behemoth.
Japan's swelling investment in Southeast Asia is part of its economic evolution.
In the past decade, Japanese manufacturers concentrated on domestic production for export.
In the 1990s, spurred by rising labor costs and the strong yen, these companies will increasingly turn themselves into multinationals with plants around the world.
To capture the investment, Southeast Asian nations will move to accommodate Japanese business.
These nations' internal decisions "will be made in a way not to offend their largest aid donor, largest private investor and largest lender," says Richard Drobnick, director of the international business and research program at the University of Southern California's Graduate School of Business.
Japanese money will help turn Southeast Asia into a more cohesive economic region.
But, analysts say, Asian cooperation isn't likely to parallel the European Common Market approach.
Rather, Japanese investment will spur integration of certain sectors, says Kent Calder, a specialist in East Asian economies at the Woodrow Wilson School for Public and Internatonal Affairs at Princeton University.
In electronics, for example, a Japanese company might make television picture tubes in Japan, assemble the sets in Malaysia and export them to Indonesia.
"The effect will be to pull Asia together not as a common market but as an integrated production zone," says Goldman Sachs's Mr. Hormats.
Countries in the region also are beginning to consider a framework for closer economic and political ties.
The economic and foreign ministers of 12 Asian and Pacific nations will meet in Australia next week to discuss global trade issues as well as regional matters such as transportation and telecommunications.
Participants will include the U.S., Australia, Canada, Japan, South Korea and New Zealand as well as the six members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations -- Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines and Brunei.
In addition, the U.S. this year offered its own plan for cooperation around the Pacific rim in a major speech by Secretary of State James Baker, following up a proposal made in January by Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke.
The Baker proposal reasserts Washington's intention to continue playing a leading political role in the region.
"In Asia, as in Europe, a new order is taking shape," Mr. Baker said.
"The U.S., with its regional friends, must play a crucial role in designing its architecture."
But maintaining U.S. influence will be difficult in the face of Japanese dominance in the region.
Japan not only outstrips the U.S. in investment flows but also outranks it in trade with most Southeast Asian countries (although the U.S. remains the leading trade partner for all of Asia).
Moreover, the Japanese government, now the world's largest aid donor, is pumping far more assistance into the region than the U.S. is.
While U.S. officials voice optimism about Japan's enlarged role in Asia, they also convey an undertone of caution.
"There's an understanding on the part of the U.S. that Japan has to expand its functions" in Asia, says J. Michael Farren, undersecretary of commerce for trade.
"If they approach it with a benevolent, altruistic attitude, there will be a net gain for everyone."
Some Asian nations are apprehensive about Washington's demand that Tokyo step up its military spending to ease the U.S. security burden in the region.
The issue is further complicated by uncertainty over the future of the U.S.'s leases on military bases in the Philippines and by a possible U.S. troop reduction in South Korea.
Many Asians regard a U.S. presence as a desirable counterweight to Japanese influence.
"No one wants the U.S. to pick up its marbles and go home," Mr. Hormats says.
For their part, Taiwan and South Korea are expected to step up their own investments in the next decade to try to slow the Japanese juggernaut.
"They don't want Japan to monopolize the region and sew it up," says Chong-sik Lee, professor of East Asian politics at the University of Pennsylvania.
Cathryn Rice could hardly believe her eyes.
While giving the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills to ninth graders at Greenville High School last March 16, she spotted a student looking at crib sheets.
She had seen cheating before, but these notes were uncanny.
"A stockbroker is an example of a profession in trade and finance....
At the end of World War II, Germany surrendered before Japan....
The Senate-House conference committee is used when a bill is passed by the House and Senate in different forms."
Virtually word for word, the notes matched questions and answers on the social-studies section of the test the student was taking.
In fact, the student had the answers to almost all of the 40 questions in that section.
The student surrendered the notes, but not without a protest.
"My teacher said it was OK for me to use the notes on the test," he said.
The teacher in question was Nancy Yeargin -- considered by many students and parents to be one of the best at the school.
Confronted, Mrs. Yeargin admitted she had given the questions and answers two days before the examination to two low-ability geography classes.
She had gone so far as to display the questions on an overhead projector and underline the answers.
Mrs. Yeargin was fired and prosecuted under an unusual South Carolina law that makes it a crime to breach test security.
In September, she pleaded guilty and paid a $500 fine.
Her alternative was 90 days in jail.
Her story is partly one of personal downfall.
She was an unstinting teacher who won laurels and inspired students, but she will probably never teach again.
In her wake she left the bitterness and anger of a principal who was her friend and now calls her a betrayer; of colleagues who say she brought them shame; of students and parents who defended her and insist she was treated harshly; and of school-district officials stunned that despite the bald-faced nature of her actions, she became something of a local martyr.
Mrs. Yeargin's case also casts some light on the dark side of school reform, where pressures on teachers are growing and where high-stakes testing has enhanced the temptation to cheat.
The 1987 statute Mrs. Yeargin violated was designed to enforce provisions of South Carolina's school-improvement laws.
Prosecutors alleged that she was trying to bolster students' scores to win a bonus under the state's 1984 Education Improvement Act.
The bonus depended on her ability to produce higher student-test scores.
"There is incredible pressure on school systems and teachers to raise test scores," says Walt Haney, an education professor and testing specialist at Boston College.
"So efforts to beat the tests are also on the rise."
And most disturbing, it is educators, not students, who are blamed for much of the wrongdoing.
A 50-state study released in September by Friends for Education, an Albuquerque, N.M., school-research group, concluded that "outright cheating by American educators" is "common."
The group says standardized achievement test scores are greatly inflated because teachers often "teach the test" as Mrs. Yeargin did, although most are never caught.
Evidence of widespread cheating has surfaced in several states in the last year or so.
California's education department suspects adult responsibility for erasures at 40 schools that changed wrong answers to right ones on a statewide test.
After numerous occurrences of questionable teacher help to students, Texas is revising its security practices.
And sales of test-coaching booklets for classroom instruction are booming.
These materials, including Macmillan/McGraw-Hill School Publishing Co.'s Scoring High and Learning Materials -- are nothing short of sophisticated crib sheets, according to some recent academic research.
By using them, teachers -- with administrative blessing -- telegraph to students beforehand the precise areas on which a test will concentrate, and sometimes give away a few exact questions and answers.
Use of Scoring High is widespread in South Carolina and common in Greenville County, Mrs. Yeargin's school district.
Experts say there isn't another state in the country where tests mean as much as they do in South Carolina.
Under the state's Education Improvement Act, low test scores can block students' promotions or force entire districts into wrenching, state-supervised "interventions" that can mean firings.
High test scores, on the other hand, bring recognition and extra money -- a new computer lab for a school, grants for special projects, a bonus for the superintendent.
And South Carolina says it is getting results.
Since the reforms went in place, for example, no state has posted a higher rate of improvement on the Scholastic Aptitude Test than South Carolina, although the state still posts the lowest average score of the about 21 states who use the SAT as the primary college entrance examination.
Critics say South Carolina is paying a price by stressing improved test scores so much.
Friends of Education rates South Carolina one of the worst seven states in its study on academic cheating.
Says the organization's founder, John Cannell, prosecuting Mrs. Yeargin is "a way for administrators to protect themselves and look like they take cheating seriously, when in fact they don't take it seriously at all."
Paul Sandifer, director of testing for the South Carolina department of education, says Mr. Cannell's allegations of cheating "are purely without foundation," and based on unfair inferences.
Partly because of worries about potential abuse, however, he says the state will begin keeping closer track of achievement-test preparation booklets next spring.
South Carolina's reforms were designed for schools like Greenville High School.
Standing on a shaded hill in a run-down area of this old textile city, the school has educated many of South Carolina's best and brightest, including the state's last two governors, Nobel Prize winning physicist Charles Townes and actress Joanne Woodward.
But by the early 1980s, its glory had faded like the yellow bricks of its broad facade.
"It was full of violence and gangs and kids cutting class," says Linda Ward, the school's principal.
"Crime was awful, test scores were low, and there was no enrollment in honors programs."
Mrs. Ward took over in 1986, becoming the school's seventh principal in 15 years.
Her immediate predecessor suffered a nervous breakdown.
Prior to his term, a teacher bled to death in the halls, stabbed by a student.
Academically, Mrs. Ward says, the school was having trouble serving in harmony its two disparate, and evenly split, student groups: a privileged white elite from old monied neighborhoods and blacks, many of them poor, from run-down, inner city neighborhoods.
Mrs. Ward resolved to clean out "deadwood" in the school's faculty and restore safety, and she also had some new factors working in her behalf.
One was statewide school reform, which raised overall educational funding and ushered in a new public spirit for school betterment.
Another was Nancy Yeargin, who came to Greenville in 1985, full of the energy and ambitions that reformers wanted to reward.
I loved the school, its history.
I even dreamt about school and new things to do with my students."
While Mrs. Ward fired and restructured staff and struggled to improve curriculum, Mrs. Yeargin worked 14-hour days and fast became a student favorite.
In 1986-87 and 1987-88, she applied for and won bonus pay under the reform law.
Encouraged by Mrs. Ward, Mrs. Yeargin taught honor students in the state "teacher cadet" program, a reform creation designed to encourage good students to consider teaching as a career.
She won grant money for the school, advised cheerleaders, ran the pep club, proposed and taught a new "Cultural Literacy" class in Western Civilization and was chosen by the school PTA as "Teacher of the Year."
"She was an inspirational lady; she had it all together," says Laura Dobson, a freshman at the University of South Carolina who had Mrs. Yeargin in the teacher-cadet class last year.
She says that because of Mrs. Yeargin she gave up ambitions in architecture and is studying to become a teacher.
Mary Beth Marchand, a Greenville 11th grader, also says Mrs. Yeargin inspired her to go into education.
"She taught us more in Western Civilization than I've ever learned in other classes," says Kelli Green, a Greenville senior.
In the classroom, students say, Mrs. Yeargin distinguished herself by varying teaching approaches -- forcing kids to pair up to complete classroom work or using college-bowl type competitions.
On weekends, she came to work to prepare study plans or sometimes, even to polish the furniture in her classroom.
"She just never gave it up," says Mary Marchand, Mary Beth's mother.
"You'd see her correcting homework in the stands at a football game."
Some fellow teachers, however, viewed Mrs. Yeargin as cocky and too yielding to students.
Mrs. Ward says she often defended her to colleagues who called her a grandstander.
Pressures began to build.
Friends told her she was pushing too hard.
Because of deteriorating hearing, she told colleagues she feared she might not be able to teach much longer.
Mrs. Yeargin's extra work was also helping her earn points in the state's incentive-bonus program.
But the most important source of points was student improvement on tests.
Huge gains by her students in 1987 and 1988 meant a total of $5,000 in bonuses over two years -- a meaningful addition to her annual salary of $23,000.
Winning a bonus for a third year wasn't that important to her, Mrs. Yeargin insists.
But others at Greenville High say she was eager to win -- if not for money, then for pride and recognition.
Mary Elizabeth Ariail, another social-studies teacher, says she believed Mrs. Yeargin wanted to keep her standing high so she could get a new job that wouldn't demand good hearing.
Indeed, Mrs. Yeargin was interested in a possible job with the state teacher cadet program.
Last March, after attending a teaching seminar in Washington, Mrs. Yeargin says she returned to Greenville two days before annual testing feeling that she hadn't prepared her low-ability geography students adequately.
When test booklets were passed out 48 hours ahead of time, she says she copied questions in the social studies section and gave the answers to students.
Mrs. Yeargin admits she made a big mistake but insists her motives were correct.
"I was trying to help kids in an unfair testing situation," she says.
"Only five of the 40 questions were geography questions.
The rest were history, sociology, finance -- subjects they never had."
Mrs. Yeargin says that she also wanted to help lift Greenville High School's overall test scores, usually near the bottom of 14 district high schools in rankings carried annually by local newspapers.
Mostly, she says, she wanted to prevent the damage to self-esteem that her low-ability students would suffer from doing badly on the test.
"These kids broke my heart," she says.
"A whole day goes by and no one even knows they're alive.
They desperately needed somebody who showed they cared for them, who loved them.
The last thing they needed was another drag-down blow."
School officials and prosecutors say Mrs. Yeargin is lying.
They found students in an advanced class a year earlier who said she gave them similar help, although because the case wasn't tried in court, this evidence was never presented publicly.
"That pretty much defeats any inkling that she was out to help the poor underprivileged child," says Joe Watson, the prosecutor in the case, who is also president of Greenville High School's alumni association.
Mrs. Yeargin concedes that she went over the questions in the earlier class, adding: "I wanted to help all" students.
Mr. Watson says Mrs. Yeargin never complained to school officials that the standardized test was unfair.
"Do I have much sympathy for her?" Mr. Watson asks.
"Not really.
I believe in the system.
I believe you have to use the system to change it.
What she did was like taking the law into your own hands."
Mrs. Ward says that when the cheating was discovered, she wanted to avoid the morale-damaging public disclosure that a trial would bring.
She says she offered Mrs. Yeargin a quiet resignation and thought she could help save her teaching certificate.
Mrs. Yeargin declined.
I was dumbfounded," Mrs. Ward recalls.
"It was like someone had turned a knife in me."
To the astonishment and dismay of her superiors and legal authorities -- and perhaps as a measure of the unpopularity of standardized tests -- Mrs. Yeargin won widespread local support.
The school-board hearing at which she was dismissed was crowded with students, teachers and parents who came to testify on her behalf.
Supportive callers decried unfair testing, not Mrs. Yeargin, on a local radio talk show on which she appeared.
The show didn't give the particulars of Mrs. Yeargin's offense, saying only that she helped students do better on the test.
"The message to the board of education out of all this is we've got to take a serious look at how we're doing our curriculum and our testing policies in this state," said the talk-show host.
Editorials in the Greenville newspaper allowed that Mrs. Yeargin was wrong, but also said the case showed how testing was being overused.
The radio show "enraged us," says Mrs. Ward.
Partly because of the show, Mr. Watson says, the district decided not to recommend Mrs. Yeargin for a first-time offenders program that could have expunged the charges and the conviction from her record.
And legal authorities cranked up an investigation worthy of a murder case.
Over 50 witnesses, mostly students, were interviewed.
At Greenville High School, meanwhile, some students -- especially on the cheerleading squad -- were crushed.
"It's hard to explain to a 17-year-old why someone they like had to go," says Mrs. Ward.
Soon, T-shirts appeared in the corridors that carried the school's familiar red-and-white GHS logo on the front.
On the back, the shirts read, "We have all the answers."
Many colleagues are angry at Mrs. Yeargin.
"She did a lot of harm," says Cathryn Rice, who had discovered the crib notes.
"We work damn hard at what we do for damn little pay, and what she did cast unfair aspersions on all of us."
But several teachers also say the incident casts doubt on the wisdom of evaluating teachers or schools by using standardized test scores.
Says Gayle Key, a mathematics teacher, "The incentive pay thing has opened up a can of worms.
There may be others doing what she did."
Mrs. Yeargin says she pleaded guilty because she realized it would no longer be possible to win reinstatement, and because she was afraid of further charges.
Mrs. Ward, for one, was relieved.
Despite the strong evidence against Mrs. Yeargin, popular sentiment was so strong in her favor, Mrs. Ward says, that "I'm afraid a jury wouldn't have convicted her.
Since chalk first touched slate, schoolchildren have wanted to know: What's on the test?
These days, students can often find the answer in test-coaching workbooks and worksheets their teachers give them in the weeks prior to taking standardized achievement tests.
The mathematics section of the widely used California Achievement Test asks fifth graders: "What is another name for the Roman numeral IX?"
It also asks them to add two-sevenths and three-sevenths.
Worksheets in a test-practice kit called Learning Materials, sold to schools across the country by Macmillan/McGraw-Hill School Publishing Co., contain the same questions.
In many other instances, there is almost no difference between the real test and Learning Materials.
What's more, the test and Learning Materials are both produced by the same company, Macmillan/McGraw-Hill, a joint venture of McGraw-Hill Inc. and Macmillan's parent, Britain's Maxwell Communication Corp.
Close parallels between tests and practice tests are common, some educators and researchers say.
Test-preparation booklets, software and worksheets are a booming publishing subindustry.
But some practice products are so similar to the tests themselves that critics say they represent a form of school-sponsored cheating.
"If I took {these preparation booklets} into my classroom, I'd have a hard time justifying to my students and parents that it wasn't cheating," says John Kaminski, a Traverse City, Mich., teacher who has studied test coaching.
He and other critics say such coaching aids can defeat the purpose of standardized tests, which is to gauge learning progress.
"It's as if France decided to give only French history questions to students in a European history class, and when everybody aces the test, they say their kids are good in European history," says John Cannell, an Albuquerque, N.M., psychiatrist and founder of an educational research organization, Friends for Education, which has studied standardized testing.
Standardized achievement tests are given about 10 million times a year across the country to students generally from kindergarten through eighth grade.
The most widely used of these tests are Macmillan/McGraw's CAT and Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills; the Iowa Test of Basic Skills, by Houghton Mifflin Co.; and Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc.'s Metropolitan Achievement Test and Stanford Achievement Test.
Sales figures of the test-prep materials aren't known, but their reach into schools is significant.
In Arizona, California, Florida, Louisiana, Maryland, New Jersey, South Carolina and Texas, educators say they are common classroom tools.
Macmillan/McGraw says "well over 10 million" of its Scoring High test-preparation books have been sold since their introduction 10 years ago, with most sales in the last five years.
About 20,000 sets of Learning Materials teachers' binders have also been sold in the past four years.
The materials in each set reach about 90 students.
Scoring High and Learning Materials are the best-selling preparation tests.
Michael Kean, director of marketing for CTB Macmillan/McGraw, the Macmillan/McGraw division that publishes Learning Materials, says it isn't aimed at improving test scores.
He also asserted that exact questions weren't replicated.
When referred to the questions that matched, he said it was coincidental.
Mr. Kaminski, the schoolteacher, and William Mehrens, a Michigan State University education professor, concluded in a study last June that CAT test versions of Scoring High and Learning Materials shouldn't be used in the classroom because of their similarity to the actual test.
They devised a 69-point scale -- awarding one point for each subskill measured on the CAT test -- to rate the closeness of test preparatives to the fifth-grade CAT.
Because many of these subskills -- the symmetry of geometrical figures, metric measurement of volume, or pie and bar graphs, for example -- are only a small part of the total fifth-grade curriculum, Mr. Kaminski says, the preparation kits wouldn't replicate too many, if their real intent was general instruction or even general familiarization with test procedures.
But Learning Materials matched on 66.5 of 69 subskills.
Scoring High matched on 64.5.
In CAT sections where students' knowledge of two-letter consonant sounds is tested, the authors noted that Scoring High concentrated on the same sounds that the test does -- to the exclusion of other sounds that fifth graders should know.
Learning Materials for the fifth-grade contains at least a dozen examples of exact matches or close parallels to test items.
Rick Brownell, senior editor of Scoring High, says that Messrs. Kaminski and Mehrens are ignoring "the need students have for becoming familiar with tests and testing format."
He said authors of Scoring High "scrupulously avoid" replicating exact questions, but he doesn't deny that some items are similar.
When Scoring High first came out in 1979, it was a publication of Random House.
McGraw-Hill was outraged.
In a 1985 advisory to educators, McGraw-Hill said Scoring High shouldn't be used because it represented a "parallel form" of the CAT and CTBS tests.
But in 1988, McGraw-Hill purchased the Random House unit that publishes Scoring High, which later became part of Macmillan/McGraw.
Messrs. Brownell and Kean say they are unaware of any efforts by McGraw-Hill to modify or discontinue Scoring High.
Alleghany Corp. said it completed the acquisition of Sacramento Savings & Loan Association from the H.N. & Frances C. Berger Foundation for $150 million.
The Sacramento-based S&L, which has 44 branch offices in north central California, had assets of $2.4 billion at the end of September.
New York-based Alleghany is an insurance and financial services concern.
The purchase price includes two ancillary companies.
The Department of Health and Human Services plans to extend its moratorium on federal funding of research involving fetal-tissue transplants.
Medical researchers believe the transplantation of small amounts of fetal tissue into humans could help treat juvenile diabetes and such degenerative diseases as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's.
But anti-abortionists oppose such research because they worry that the development of therapies using fetal-tissue transplants could lead to an increase in abortions.
James Mason, assistant secretary for health, said the ban on federal funding of fetal-tissue transplant research "should be continued indefinitely."
He said the ban won't stop privately funded tissue-transplant research or federally funded fetal-tissue research that doesn't involve transplants.
Department officials say that HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan will support Dr. Mason's ruling, which will be issued soon in the form of a letter to the acting director of the National Institutes of Health.
Both Dr. Mason and Dr. Sullivan oppose federal funding for abortion, as does President Bush, except in cases where a woman's life is threatened.
The controversy began in 1987 when the National Institutes of Health, aware of the policy implications of its research, asked for an HHS review of its plan to implant fetal tissue into the brain of a patient suffering from Parkinson's disease.
The department placed a moratorium on the research, pending a review of scientific, legal and ethical issues.
A majority of an NIH-appointed panel recommended late last year that the research continue under carefully controlled conditions, but the issue became embroiled in politics as anti-abortion groups continued to oppose federal funding.
The dispute has hampered the administration's efforts to recruit prominent doctors to fill prestigious posts at the helm of the NIH and the Centers for Disease Control.
Several candidates have withdrawn their names from consideration after administration officials asked them for their views on abortion and fetal-tissue transplants.
Antonio Novello, whom Mr. Bush nominated to serve as surgeon general, reportedly has assured the administration that she opposes abortion.
Dr. Novello is deputy director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.
Some researchers have charged that the administration is imposing new ideological tests for top scientific posts.
Earlier this week, Dr. Sullivan tried to defuse these charges by stressing that candidates to head the NIH and the CDC will be judged by "standards of scientific and administrative excellence," not politics.
But the administration's handling of the fetal-tissue transplant issue disturbs many scientists.
"When scientific progress moves into uncharted ground, there has to be a role for society to make judgments about its applications," says Myron Genel, associate dean of the Yale Medical School.
"The disturbing thing about this abortion issue is that the debate has become polarized, so that no mechanism exists" for finding a middle ground.
Yale is one of the few medical institutions conducting privately funded research on fetal-tissue transplants.
But Dr. Genel warns that Dr. Mason's ruling may discourage private funding.
"The unavailability of federal funds, and the climate in which the decision was made, certainly don't provide any incentive for one of the more visible foundations to provide support," he said.
Despite the flap over transplants, federal funding of research involving fetal tissues will continue on a number of fronts.
"Such research may ultimately result in the ability to regenerate damaged tissues or to turn off genes that cause cancer" or to regulate genes that cause Down's syndrome, the leading cause of mental retardation, according to an NIH summary.
The NIH currently spends about $8 million annually on fetal-tissue research out of a total research budget of $8 billion.
Rekindled hope that two New England states will allow broader interstate banking boosted Nasdaq's bank stocks, but the over-the-counter market was up only slightly in lackluster trading.
The Nasdaq composite index added 1.01 to 456.64 on paltry volume of 118.6 million shares.
In terms of volume, it was an inauspicious beginning for November.
Yesterday's share turnover was well below the year's daily average of 133.8 million.
In October, the busiest month of the year so far, daily volume averaged roughly 145 million shares.
The Nasdaq 100 index of the biggest nonfinancial stocks gained 1.39 to 446.62.
The index of the 100 largest Nasdaq financial stocks rose modestly as well, gaining 1.28 to 449.04.
But the broader Nasdaq bank index, which tracks thrift issues, jumped 3.23 to 436.01.
The bank stocks got a boost when Connecticut Bank & Trust and Bank of New England said they no longer oppose pending legislation that would permit banks from other regions to merge with Connecticut and Massachusetts banks.
The two banks merged in 1985.
Bank of New England's shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
The stocks of banking concerns based in Massachusetts weren't helped much by the announcement, traders said, because many of those concerns have financial problems tied to their real-estate loan portfolios, making them unattractive takeover targets.
But speculators, anticipating that Connecticut will approve a law permitting such interstate banking soon, immediately bid up shares of Connecticut banks on the news.
"A lot of the stocks that have been under water finally saw a reason to uptick," said George Jennison, head trader of banking issues in Shearson Lehman Hutton's OTC department.
The biggest beneficiary was Northeast Bancorp, which surged 7 3/4 to 69.
The Stamford, Conn., concern has agreed to a buy-out by Bank of New York in a transaction with an indicated value of about $100 a share that expires next August.
Ed Macheski, a Wilton, Conn., money manager who follows bank stocks, said the announcement effectively gives the deal "the green light."
Mr. Jennison said Northeast Bancorp also fared well because takeover stocks have returned to favor among investors.
Another OTC bank stock involved in a buy-out deal, First Constitution Financial, was higher.
It rose 7/8 to 18 1/4.
First Constitution has signed a merger agreement with WFRR L.P. and GHKM Corp., under which all of its common shares will be acquired for $25 each, or $273.5 million.
Among other Connecticut banks whose shares trade in the OTC market, Society for Savings Bancorp, based in Hartford, saw its stock rise 1 3/4 to 18 1/4.
Centerbank added 5/8 to 8 3/4; shares of NESB, a New London-based bank holding company, rose 5/8 to 5 7/8.
Among other banking issues, Pennview Savings Association leapt more than 44% with a gain of 6 5/8 to 21 5/8.
The Pennsylvania bank agreed to be acquired in a merger with Univest Corp. of Pennsylvania for $25.50 a share.
Valley Federal Savings & Loan, a California thrift issue, gained 1 to 4 1/4 after reporting a third-quarter loss of $70.7 million after an $89.9 million pretax charge mostly related to its mobile home financing unit.
Dan E. Nelms, Valley Federal's president and chief executive officer, said the one-time charge substantially eliminates future losses associated with the unit.
He said the company's core business remains strong.
He also said that after the charges, and "assuming no dramatic fluctuation in interest rates, the company expects to achieve near-record earnings in 1990."
Weisfield's surged 6 3/4 to 55 1/2 and Ratners Group's American depositary receipts, or ADRs, gained 5/8 to 12 1/4.
The two concerns said they entered into a definitive merger agreement under which Ratners will begin a tender offer for all of Weisfield's common shares for $57.50 each.
Also on the takeover front, Jaguar's ADRs rose 1/4 to 13 7/8 on turnover of 4.4 million.
Since the British auto maker became a takeover target last month, its ADRs have jumped about 78%.
After troubled Heritage Media proposed acquiring POP Radio in a stock swap, POP Radio's shares tumbled 4 to 14 3/4.
Heritage Media, which already owns about 51% of POP Radio, proposed paying POP Radio shareholders with shares of a new class of Heritage Media preferred stock that would be convertible into four shares of Heritage Media's common.
Rally's lost 1 3/4 to 21 3/4.
The restaurant operator said it has redeemed its rights issued Monday under its shareholder rights plan.
The fast-food company said its decision was based on discussions with a shareholder group, Giant Group Ltd., "in an effort to resolve certain disputes with the company."
Giant Group is led by three Rally's directors, Burt Sugarman, James M. Trotter III and William E. Trotter II, who earlier this month indicated they had a 42.5% stake in Rally's and planned to seek a majority of seats on Rally's nine-member board.
SCI Systems slipped 7/8 to 10 on volume of 858,000 shares.
The Huntsville, Ala., electronic products maker said it expects to post a "significant" loss for its fiscal first quarter ended Sept. 30.
In the year-earlier period, SCI had net income of $4.8 million, or 23 cents a share, on revenue of $225.6 million.
The Internal Revenue Service has threatened criminal sanctions against lawyers who fail to report detailed information about clients who pay them more than $10,000 in cash.
The warnings, issued to at least 100 criminal defense attorneys in several major cities in the last week, have led to an outcry by members of the organized bar, who claim the information is protected by attorney-client privilege.
The IRS warnings stem from a 1984 law that requires anyone who receives more than $10,000 in cash from a client or customer in one or more related transactions "in the course of trade or business" to report the payment on a document known as Form 8300.
The form asks for such details as the client's name, Social Security number, passport number and details about the services provided for the payment.
Failure to complete the form had been punishable as a misdemeanor until last November, when Congress determined that the crime was a felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison.
Attorneys have argued since 1985, when the law took effect, that they cannot provide information about clients who don't wish their identities to be known.
Many attorneys have returned incomplete forms to the IRS in recent years, citing attorney-client privilege.
Until last week, the IRS rarely acted on the incomplete forms.
"This form forces a lawyer to become, in effect, a witness against his client," said Neal R. Sonnett, president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.
"The IRS is asking lawyers to red-flag a criminal problem to the government," added Mr. Sonnett, a Miami lawyer who has heard from dozens of attorneys who received letters in recent days and has himself received the computer-generated IRS forms sent by certified mail.
Mr. Sonnett said that clients who pay cash may include alleged drug dealers who don't have domestic bank accounts.
These individuals may not necessarily be under investigation when they hire lawyers.
Mr. Sonnett said there also may be other circumstances under which individuals wouldn't want the government to know they had retained criminal defense lawyers.
Filling out detailed forms about these individuals would tip the IRS off and spark action against the clients, he said.
The defense lawyers' group formed a task force this week, chaired by New York attorney Gerald Lefcourt, to deal with the matter.
The American Bar Association's House of Delegates passed a resolution in 1985 condemning the IRS reporting requirement.
Michael Ross, a New York lawyer who heads the ABA's grand jury committee, said that lawyers are prohibited by the ABA's code of ethics from disclosing information about a client except where a court orders it or to prevent the client from committing a criminal act that could result in death.
Mr. Ross said he met with officials of the IRS and the Justice Department, which would bring any enforcement actions against taxpayers, to discuss the issue last May.
At that meeting, he said, the Justice Department assured him that enforcement procedures wouldn't be threatened against attorneys without further review and advance notice.
Mr. Ross said IRS officials opposed the Justice Department's moderate stance on the matter.
But in the letters sent in recent days, Christopher J. Lezovich of the IRS computing center in Detroit, told attorneys that "failing to voluntarily submit the requested information could result in summons enforcement action being initiated."
In some cases, the IRS asked for information dating back to forms it received in 1985.
A spokesman for the IRS confirmed that "there has been correspondence mailed about incomplete 8300s," but he declined to say why the letters were sent to lawyers now.
Individuals familiar with the Justice Department's policy said that Justice officials hadn't any knowledge of the IRS's actions in the last week.
Lawyers worry that if they provide information about clients, that data could quickly end up in the hands of prosecutors.
Prosecutors need court permission to obtain the tax returns of an individual or a business.
But they have obtained 8300 forms without court permission and used the information to help develop criminal cases.
Some criminal lawyers speculated that the IRS was sending the letters to test the issue.
In a number of recent cases, federal courts have refused to recognize attorneys' assertions that information relating to fees from clients should be confidential.
THE WAR OVER FEDERAL JUDICIAL SALARIES takes a victim.
Often, judges ease into more lucrative private practice with little fanfare, but not federal Judge Raul A. Ramirez in Sacramento, Calif.
On Tuesday, the judge called a news conference to say he was quitting effective Dec. 31 to join a San Francisco law firm.
The reason: the refusal of Congress to give federal judges a raise.
"A couple of my law clerks were going to pass me in three or four years, and I was afraid I was going to have to ask them for a loan," the judge quipped in an interview.
Federal judges make $89,500 annually; in February, Congress rejected a bill that would have increased their pay by 50%.
Judge Ramirez, 44, said it is unjust for judges to make what they do.
"Judges are not getting what they deserve.
You look around at professional ballplayers or accountants... and nobody blinks an eye.
When you become a federal judge, all of a sudden you are relegated to a paltry sum."
At his new job, as partner in charge of federal litigation in the Sacramento office of Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe, he will make out much better.
The judge declined to discuss his salary in detail, but said: "I'm going to be a high-priced lawyer."
DOONESBURY CREATOR'S UNION TROUBLES are no laughing matter.
Cartoonist Garry Trudeau is suing the Writers Guild of America East for $11 million, alleging it mounted a "campaign to harass and punish" him for crossing a screenwriters' picket line.
The dispute involves Darkhorse Productions Inc., a TV production company in which Mr. Trudeau is a co-owner.
Mr. Trudeau, a Writers Guild member, also was employed as a writer for Darkhorse, which was covered by a guild collective-bargaining agreement.
The guild began a strike against the TV and movie industry in March 1988.
In his lawsuit, Mr. Trudeau says the strike illegally included Darkhorse, and the cartoonist refused to honor the strike against the company.
A spokesman for the guild said the union's lawyers are reviewing the suit.
He said disciplinary proceedings are confidential and declined to comment on whether any are being held against Mr. Trudeau.
Mr. Trudeau's attorney, Norman K. Samnick, said the harassment consists mainly of the guild's year-long threats of disciplinary action.
Mr. Samnick said a guild disciplinary hearing is scheduled next Monday in New York.
Mr. Samnick, who will go before the disciplinary panel, said the proceedings are unfair and that any punishment from the guild would be unjustified.
In addition to the damages, the suit seeks a court order preventing the guild from punishing or retaliating against Mr. Trudeau.
A federal appeals court upheld a lower court ruling that the U.S. can bar the use of federal funds for family-planning programs that include abortion-related services.
A Department of Health and Human Services rule adopted in 1988 prohibits the use of so-called Title X funds for programs that assist a woman in obtaining an abortion, such as abortion counseling and referrals.
The rule also prohibits funding for activities that "encourage, promote or advocate abortion."
Title X funds are the single largest source of federal funding for family-planning services, according to the opinion by the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York.
The panel ruled that the restrictions don't violate the freedom of speech of health care providers and that the limits on counseling services don't violate the rights of pregnant women.
INQUIRY CLEARS TEXAS JUDGE of bias in comments on homosexual murder victims.
Dallas District Judge Jack Hampton had sparked calls for a judicial inquiry with his remarks to the press last December, two weeks after sentencing an 18-year-old defendant to 30 years in state prison for killing two homosexual men in a city park.
The judge was quoted as referring to the victims as "queers" and saying they wouldn't have been killed "if they hadn't been cruising the streets picking up teenage boys."
But Robert R. Murray, a special master appointed by the Texas Supreme Court, said Judge Hampton didn't breach any judicial standards of fairness, although he did violate the state's judicial code by commenting publicly on a pending case.
Observing that the judge "has never exhibited any bias or prejudice," Mr. Murray concluded that he "would be impartial in any case involving a homosexual or prostitute" as a victim.
Mr. Murray also said Judge Hampton's comments didn't discredit the judiciary or the administration of justice.
The report is subject to review by the State Commission on Judicial Conduct, which is empowered to impose sanctions.
GAF TRIAL goes to round three.
Attorneys in the third stock-manipulation trial of GAF Corp. began opening arguments yesterday in the Manhattan courtroom of U.S. District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe.
In an eight-count indictment, the government has charged GAF, a Wayne, N.J., specialty chemical maker, and its Vice Chairman James T. Sherwin with attempting to manipulate the common stock of Union Carbide Corp. in advance of GAF's planned sale of a large block of the stock in November 1986.
The first two GAF trials ended in mistrials earlier this year.
This trial is expected to last five weeks.
A former member of the prosecution team in the Iran/Contra affair joined the Chicago firm of Mayer, Brown & Platt.
Michael R. Bromwich, a member since January 1987 of the three-lawyer trial team in the prosecution of Oliver North, became a partner in the Washington, D.C., office of the 520-lawyer firm.
He will specialize in white-collar criminal defense work.
Mr. Bromwich, 35, also has served as deputy chief and chief of the narcotics unit for the U.S. attorney's office for the Southern District of New York, based in Manhattan.
Cooper Tire & Rubber Co. said it has reached an agreement in principle to buy buildings and related property in Albany, Ga., from Bridgestone/Firestone Inc.
Terms weren't disclosed.
The tire maker said the buildings consist of 1.8 million square feet of office, manufacturing and warehousing space on 353 acres of land.
Fujitsu Ltd.'s top executive took the unusual step of publicly apologizing for his company's making bids of just one yen for several local government projects, while computer rival NEC Corp. made a written apology for indulging in the same practice.
Meanwhile, business and government leaders rebuked the computer makers, and fretted about the broader statement the companies' actions make about Japanese cutthroat pricing.
Fujitsu said it bid the equivalent of less than a U.S. penny on three separate municipal contracts during the past two years.
The company also disclosed that during that period it offered 10,000 yen, or about $70, for another contract.
But Fujitsu, Japan's No. 1 computer maker, isn't alone.
NEC, one of its largest domestic competitors, said it bid one yen in two separate public auctions since 1987.
In both cases, NEC lost the contract to Fujitsu, which made the same bid and won a tie-breaking lottery.
All the contracts were for computer-system-design contracts and involved no hardware or software.
The Ministry of International Trade and Industry summoned executives from the companies to "make sure they understood" the concern about such practices, according to a government spokesman.
"These cases lead to the loss of the firms' social and international credibility," a ministry statement said.
Japan's Fair Trade Commission has said it is considering investigating the bids for possible antitrust-law violations.
"We would like to apologize for having caused huge trouble," Fujitsu President Takuma Yamamoto, read from a prepared statement as he stood before a packed news conference at his company's downtown headquarters.
The bids, he added, were "contrary to common sense."
NEC released a statement saying, "We feel sorry for having caused trouble to society," a form of apology common in Japan for companies caught in embarrassing situations.
Japanese companies have long had a reputation for sacrificing short-term profits to make a sale that may have long-term benefits.
But the growing controversy comes as many practices historically accepted as normal here -- such as politicians accepting substantial gifts from businessmen or having extramarital affairs -- are coming under close ethical scrutiny.
The fire is also fueled by growing international interest in Japanese behavior.
So far there have been no public overseas complaints about the issue.
But in one of the auctions in question, International Business Machines Corp. made a bid substantially higher than the Fujitsu offer, according to the municipality.
The low-ball bids touch on issues central to the increasingly tense trade debate.
Foreigners complain that they have limited access to government procurement in Japan, in part because Japanese companies unfairly undercut them.
The U.S. government in recent years has accused Japanese companies of excessively slashing prices on semiconductors and supercomputers -- products Fujitsu and NEC make.
Asked whether the bidding flap would hurt U.S.-Japan relations, Mr. Yamamoto said, "this will be a minus factor."
The "one-yen" controversy first came to a head last week when the city of Hiroshima announced that Fujitsu won a contract to design a computer system to map its waterworks.
The city had expected to pay about 11 million yen ($77,000), but Fujitsu essentially offered to do it for free.
Then Wednesday, Fujitsu said it made a similar bid to win a library contract in Nagano prefecture two weeks earlier.
It also said that in July, it bid 10,000 yen to design a system for the Saitama prefectural library, and two years ago, it bid one yen to plan the telecommunications system for Wakayama prefecture.
The company said it has offered to withdraw its bids in Hiroshima and Nagano.
The municipalities said they haven't decided whether to try to force the company to go through with the contracts.
Fujitsu and NEC said they were still investigating, and that knowledge of more such bids could emerge.
Mr. Yamamoto insisted that headquarters hadn't approved the bids, and that he didn't know about most of the cases until Wednesday.
Other major Japanese computer companies contacted yesterday said they have never made such bids.
"One yen is not ethical," Michio Sasaki, an official at Keidanren, the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations, said.
"Profit may be low, but at least costs should be covered.
Backe Group Inc. agreed to acquire Atlantic Publications Inc., which has 30 community papers and annual sales of $7 million.
Terms weren't disclosed.
Backe is a closely held media firm run by former CBS Inc. President John Backe.
Price Communications Corp. completed the sale of four of its TV stations to NTG Inc. for $120 million in cash and notes, retaining a 10% equity stake in the new concern.
NTG was formed by Osborn Communications Corp. and Desai Capital.
Michaels Stores Inc., which owns and operates a chain of specialty retail stores, said October sales rose 14.6% to $32.8 million from $28.6 million a year earlier.
Sales in stores open more than one year rose 3% to $29.3 million from $28.4 million.
Furukawa Co. of Japan said it will acquire two construction machinery plants and a sales unit in France formerly belonging to Dresser Industries Inc. of the U.S..
The company said it made the purchase in order to locally produce hydraulically operated shovels.
Last October, the company also bought a wheel-loader manufacturing plant in Heidelberg, West Germany, from Dresser.
Furukawa said the purchase of the French and German plants together will total about 40 billion yen ($280 million).
Structural Dynamics Research Corp., which makes computer-aided engineering software, said it introduced new technology in mechanical design automation that will improve mechanical engineering productivity.

LSI Logic Corp. reported a surprise $35.7 million third-quarter net loss, including a special restructuring charge that reflects a continuing industry-wide slowdown in semiconductor demand.
In September, the custom-chip maker said excess capacity and lagging billings would result in an estimated $2 million to $3 million net loss for the third quarter.
But company officials said yesterday that they decided to take a $43 million pretax charge for the period to cover a restructuring of world-wide manufacturing operations, citing extended weakness in the market as well as a decision to switch to more economical production techniques.
"Over the summer months, there has been a slowing in the rate of new orders from the computer sector, our primary market," said Wilfred J. Corrigan, chairman and chief executive officer.
"In addition, recent industry forecasts for 1990 indicate a slow environment, at least until midyear."
As a result, the company said it decided to phase out its oldest capacity and "make appropriate reductions" in operating expenses.
The $35.7 million net loss equals 86 cents a share.
Not counting the extraordinary charge, the company said it would have had a net loss of $3.1 million, or seven cents a share.
A year earlier, it had profit of $7.5 million, or 18 cents a share.
Revenue rose 42% to $133.7 million from $94 million.
The charge partly reflects a switch from older five-inch to more-efficient six-inch silicon wafers with which to fabricate chips.
Related to that decision, the company said it was converting its Santa Clara, Calif., factory to a research and development facility.
A spokesman declined to speculate about possible reductions in force.
"This is a company that has invested in capacity additions more aggressively than any other company in the industry and now the industry is growing more slowly and they are suddenly poorly positioned," said Michael Stark, chip analyst at Robertson, Stephens & Co.
"I think the stock is dead money for a while."
Yesterday's announcement was made after markets closed.
U.S. chip makers are facing continued slack demand following a traditionally slow summer.
Part of the problem is that chip buyers are keeping inventories low because of jitters about the course of the U.S. economy.
William G. Kuhns, former chairman and chief executive officer of General Public Utilities Corp., was elected a director of this maker of industrial and construction equipment, increasing board membership to 10.
The dollar posted gains against all major currencies yesterday, buoyed by persistent Japanese demand for U.S. bond issues.
While market sentiment remains cautiously bearish on the dollar based on sluggish U.S. economic indicators, dealers note that Japanese demand has helped underpin the dollar against the yen and has kept the U.S. currency from plunging below key levels against the mark.
At the same time, dealers said the U.S. unit has been locked into a relatively narrow range in recent weeks, in part because the hefty Japanese demand for dollars has been offset by the mark's strength, resulting in a stalemate.
Jay Goldinger, with Capital Insight Inc., reasons that while the mark has posted significant gains against the yen as well -- the mark climbed to 77.70 yen from 77.56 yen late Tuesday in New York -- the strength of the U.S. bond market compared to its foreign counterparts has helped lure investors to dollar-denominated bonds, rather than mark bonds.
"Dollar-yen {trade} is the driving force in the market," said Tom Trettien, a vice president with Banque Paribas in New York, "but I'm not convinced it will continue.
Who knows what will happen down the road, in three to six months, if foreign investment starts to erode?"
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted at 1.8500 marks, up from 1.8415 marks late Tuesday, and at 143.80 yen, up from 142.85 yen late Tuesday.
Sterling was quoted at $1.5755, down from $1.5805 late Tuesday.
In Tokyo Thursday, the U.S. currency opened for trading at 143.93 yen, up from Wednesday's Tokyo close of 143.08 yen.
Douglas Madison, a corporate trader with Bank of America in Los Angeles, traced the dollar's recent solid performance against the yen to purchases of securities by Japanese insurance companies and trust banks and the sense that another wave of investment is waiting in the wings.
He contends that the perception in Japan of a vitriolic U.S. response to Sony Corp.'s announcement of its purchase of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. has been temporarily mollified.
He cites the recent deal between the Mitsubishi Estate Co. and the Rockefeller Group, as well as the possible white knight role of an undisclosed Japanese company in the Georgia-Pacific Corp. takeover bid for Great Northern Nekoosa Corp. as evidence.
The forthcoming maturity in November of a 10-year Japanese government yen-denominated bond issue valued at about $16 billion has prompted speculation in the market that investors redeeming the bonds will diversify into dollar-denominated instruments, according to Mr. Madison.
It remains unclear whether the bond issue will be rolled over.
Meanwhile, traders in Tokyo say that the prospect of lower U.S. interest rates has spurred dollar buying by Japanese institutions.
They point out that these institutions want to lock in returns on high-yield U.S. Treasury debt and suggest demand for the U.S. unit will continue unabated until rates in the U.S. recede.
The market again showed little interest in further evidence of a slowing U.S. economy, and traders note that the market in recent weeks has taken its cues more from Wall Street than U.S. economic indicators.
Dealers said the dollar merely drifted lower following the release Wednesday of the U.S. purchasing managers' report.
The managers' index, which measures the health of the manufacturing sector, stood at 47.6% in October, above September's 46%, and also above average forecasts for the index of 45.3%.
Some dealers said the dollar was pressured slightly because a number of market participants had boosted their expectations in the past day and were looking for an index above 50, which indicates an expanding manufacturing economy.
But most said the index had no more than a minimal effect on trade.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $374.20 an ounce, down 50 cents.
Estimated volume was a moderate 3.5 million ounces.
In early trading in Hong Kong Thursday, gold was quoted at $374.19 an ounce.
"The Cosby Show" may have single-handedly turned around ratings at NBC since its debut in 1984, and the Huxtable family still keeps millions of viewers laughing Thursday night on the network.
But some of the TV stations that bought "Cosby" reruns for record prices two years ago aren't laughing much these days.
The reruns have helped ratings at many of the 187 network affiliates and independent TV stations that air the shows.
But the ratings are considerably below expectations, and some stations say they may not buy new episodes when their current contracts expire.
Meanwhile, stations are fuming because, many of them say, the show's distributor, Viacom Inc., is giving an ultimatum: Either sign new long-term commitments to buy future episodes or risk losing "Cosby" to a competitor.
At the same time, Viacom is trying to persuade stations to make commitments to "A Different World," a spin-off of "Cosby" whose reruns will become available in 1991.
Viacom denies it's using pressure tactics.
"We're willing to negotiate," says Dennis Gillespie, executive vice president of marketing.
"We're offering this plan now because we feel it's the right time."
Viacom's move comes as the syndication market is being flooded with situation comedies that are still running on the networks.
One station manager says he believes Viacom's move is a "pre-emptive strike" because the company is worried that "Cosby" ratings will continue to drop in syndication over the next few years.
"Cosby" is down a full ratings point in the week of Oct. 2-8 over the same week a year ago, according to A.C. Nielsen Co.
Mr. Gillespie at Viacom says the ratings are rising.
And executives at stations in such major markets as Washington; Providence, R.I.; Cleveland; Raleigh, N.C.; Minneapolis, and Louisville, Ky., say they may very well not renew "Cosby."
Dick Lobo, the general manager of WTVJ, the NBC-owned station in Miami, for example, says the show has "been a major disappointment to us."
"At the prices we were charged, there should have been some return for the dollar.
There wasn't."
Neil Kuvin, the general manager of WHAS, the CBS affiliate in Louisville, says "Cosby" gets the station's highest ratings and he's "pleased."
But he adds, "I feel pressured, disappointed, uncomfortable and, frankly, quite angry with Viacom.
The Life Insurance Co. of Georgia has officially opened an office in Taipei.
David Wu, the company's representative in Taiwan, said Atlanta-based Life of Georgia will sell conventional life-insurance products.
Life of Georgia is part of the Nationale Nederlanden Group, based in the Netherlands.
In this era of frantic competition for ad dollars, a lot of revenue-desperate magazines are getting pretty cozy with advertisers -- fawning over them in articles and offering pages of advertorial space.
So can a magazine survive by downright thumbing its nose at major advertisers?
Garbage magazine, billed as "The Practical Journal for the Environment," is about to find out.
Founded by Brooklyn, N.Y., publishing entrepreneur Patricia Poore, Garbage made its debut this fall with the promise to give consumers the straight scoop on the U.S. waste crisis.
The magazine combines how-to pieces on topics like backyard composting, explanatory essays on such things as what happens after you flush your toilet, and hard-hitting pieces on alleged environmental offenders.
Garbage editors have dumped considerable energy into a whirling rampage through supermarket aisles in a bid to identify corporate America's good guys and bad boys.
In one feature, called "In the Dumpster," editors point out a product they deem to be a particularly bad offender.
From an advertising standpoint, the problem is these offenders are likely to be some of the same folks that are major magazine advertisers these days.
With only two issues under its belt, Garbage has alienated some would-be advertisers and raised the ire of others.
Campbell Soup, for one, is furious its Souper Combo microwave product was chastised in the premiere "In the Dumpster" column.
The magazine's editors ran a giant diagram of the product with arrows pointing to the packaging's polystyrene foam, polyproplene and polyester film -- all plastic items they say are non-biodegradable.
"It's precisely the kind of product that's created the municipal landfill monster," the editors wrote.
"I think that this magazine is not only called Garbage, but it is practicing journalistic garbage," fumes a spokesman for Campbell Soup.
He says Campbell wasn't even contacted by the magazine for the opportunity to comment.
Modifications had been made to the Souper Combo product at the time the issue was printed, he says, making it less an offender than was portrayed.
He admits, though, it isn't one of Campbell Soup's better products in terms of recyclability.
Campbell Soup, not surprisingly, doesn't have any plans to advertise in the magazine, according to its spokesman.
Some media experts question whether a young magazine can risk turning off Madison Avenue's big spenders.
"You really need the Campbell Soups of the world to be interested in your magazine if you're going to make a run of it," says Mike White, senior vice president and media director at DDB Needham, Chicago.
"The economics of magazine publishing pretty much require that you have a pretty solid base" of big-time ad spenders, he adds.
The first two issues featured ads from only a handful of big advertisers, including General Electric and Adolph Coors, but the majority were from companies like Waste Management Inc. and Bumkins International, firms that don't spend much money advertising and can't be relied on to support a magazine over the long haul.
A Waste Management spokeswoman says its ad in the premiere issue was a one-time purchase, and it doesn't have any plans to advertise in future issues.
"We don't spend much on print advertising," she says.
But Ms. Poore, the magazine's editor and publisher, contends Garbage can survive, at least initially, on subscription revenues.
Individual copies of the magazine sell for $2.95 and yearly subscriptions cost $21.
According to Ms. Poore, Old-House Journal Corp., her publishing company, printed and sold all 126,000 copies of the premiere issue.
The first and second issues sold out on newsstands, she says, and the magazine has orders for 93,000 subscriptions.
Asked whether potential advertisers will be scared away by the magazine's direct policy, Ms. Poore replies: "I don't know and I don't care.
I'm not saying advertising revenue isn't important," she says, "but I couldn't sleep at night" if the magazine bowed to a company because they once took out an ad.
Ad Notes....
Interpublic Group said its television programming operations -- which it expanded earlier this year -- agreed to supply more than 4,000 hours of original programming across Europe in 1990.
It said the programs, largely game shows, will be provided by its E.C. Television unit along with Fremantle International, a producer and distributor of game shows of which it recently bought 49%.
It said that volume makes it the largest supplier of original TV programming in Europe.
Interpublic is providing the programming in return for advertising time, which it said will be valued at more than $75 million in 1990 and $150 million in 1991.
It plans to sell the ad time to its clients at a discount.
CoreStates Financial Corp., Philadelphia, named Earle Palmer Brown & Spiro, Philadelphia, as agency of record for its $5 million account.
The business had been handled by VanSant Dugdale, Baltimore.

Billings weren't disclosed for the small account, which had been serviced at Young & Rubicam, New York.
Enterprise Rent-A-Car Inc. breaks its first national ad campaign this week.
The St. Louis firm specializes in replacement-car rentals, those provided by insurance companies for cars damaged in accidents.
Developed by Avrett, Free & Ginsberg, New York, the $6 million campaign pitches Enterprise's consumer-driven service and its free pick-up and drop-off service.
Young & Rubicam said it completed its acquisition of Landor Associates, a San Francisco identity-management firm.
Ketchum Communications, Pittsburgh, acquired Braun & Co., a Los Angeles investor-relations and marketing-communications firm.

Sea Containers Ltd. said it might increase the price of its $70-a-share buy-back plan if pressed by Temple Holdings Ltd., which made an earlier tender offer for Sea Containers.
Sea Containers, a Hamilton, Bermuda-based shipping concern, said Tuesday that it would sell $1.1 billion of assets and use some of the proceeds to buy about 50% of its common shares for $70 apiece.
The move is designed to ward off a hostile takeover attempt by two European shipping concerns, Stena Holding AG and Tiphook PLC.
In May, the two companies, through their jointly owned holding company, Temple, offered $50 a share, or $777 million, for Sea Containers.
In August, Temple sweetened the offer to $63 a share, or $963 million.
Yesterday, Sea Containers' chief executive officer, James Sherwood, said in an interview that, under the asset-sale plan, Sea Containers would end up with a cash surplus of approximately $620 million.
About $490 million of that would be allocated to the buy-back, leaving about $130 million, he said.
That $130 million, Mr. Sherwood said, "gives us some flexibility in case Temple raises its bid.
We are able to increase our price above the $70 level if necessary.
'' He declined to say, however, how much Sea Containers might raise its price.
Mr. Sherwood speculated that the leeway that Sea Containers has means that Temple would have to "substantially increase their bid if they're going to top us."
Temple, however, harshly criticized Sea Containers' plan yesterday, characterizing it as a "highly conditional device designed to entrench management, confuse shareholders and prevent them from accepting our superior cash offer."
A spokesman for Temple estimated that Sea Containers' plan -- if all the asset sales materialize -- would result in shareholders receiving only $36 to $45 a share in cash.
The lower figures, the spokesman said, would stem from preferred shares being converted to common stock and the possibility that Sea Containers' subsidiaries might be required to place their shares in the open market.
Temple added that Sea Containers is still mired in legal problems in Bermuda, where the Supreme Court has temporarily barred Sea Containers from buying back its own stock in a case brought by Stena and Tiphook.
{The court has indicated it will rule on the case by the end of the month.}
Temple also said Sea Containers' plan raises "numerous legal, regulatory, financial and fairness issues," but didn't elaborate.
Mr. Sherwood said reaction to Sea Containers' proposal has been "very positive."
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Sea Containers closed at $62.625, up 62.5 cents.
The Transportation Department, responding to pressure from safety advocates, took further steps to impose on light trucks and vans the safety requirements used for automobiles.
The department proposed requiring stronger roofs for light trucks and minivans, beginning with 1992 models.
It also issued a final rule requiring auto makers to equip light trucks and minivans with lap-shoulder belts for rear seats beginning in the 1992 model year.
Such belts already are required for the vehicles' front seats.
"Today's action," Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner said, "represents another milestone in the ongoing program to promote vehicle occupant safety in light trucks and minivans through its extension of passenger car standards."
In September, the department had said it will require trucks and minivans to be equipped with the same front-seat headrests that have long been required on passenger cars.
The Big Three auto makers said the rule changes weren't surprising because Bush administration officials have long said they planned to impose car safety standards on light trucks and vans.
Safety advocates, including some members of Congress, have been urging the department for years to extend car-safety requirements to light trucks and vans, which now account for almost one-third of all vehicle sales in the U.S..
They say that many vehicles classed as commercial light trucks actually carry more people than cargo and therefore should have the same safety features as cars.
They didn't have much luck during the Reagan administration.
"But now, there seems to be a fairly systematic effort to address the problem," said Chuck Hurley, vice president of communications for the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.
"We're in a very different regulatory environment."
Sen. John Danforth (R., Mo.) praised the department's actions, noting that rollover crashes account for almost half of all light-truck deaths.
"We could prevent many of these fatalities with minimum roof-crush standards," he said.
Sen. Danforth and others also want the department to require additional safety equipment in light trucks and minivans, including air bags or automatic seat belts in front seats and improved side-crash protection.
The department's roof-crush proposal would apply to vehicles weighing 10,000 pounds or less.
The roofs would be required to withstand a force of 1.5 times the unloaded weight of the vehicle.
During the test, the roof couldn't be depressed more than five inches.
In Detroit, a Chrysler Corp. official said the company currently has no rear-seat lap and shoulder belts in its light trucks, but plans to begin phasing them in by the end of the 1990 model year.
He said Chrysler fully expects to have them installed across its light-truck line by the Sept. 1, 1991, deadline.
Chrysler said its trucks and vans already meet the roof-crush resistance standard for cars.
John Leinonen, executive engineer of Ford Motor Co.'s auto-safety office, said Ford trucks have met car standards for roof-crush resistance since 1982.
Ford began installing the rear-seat belts in trucks with its F-series Crew Cab pickups in the 1989 model year.
The new Explorer sport-utility vehicle, set for introduction next spring, will also have the rear-seat belts.
Mr. Leinonen said he expects Ford to meet the deadline easily.
Consolidated Rail Corp. said it would spend more than $30 million on 1,000 enclosed railcars for transporting autos.
The multilevel railcars, scheduled for delivery in 1990, will be made by Thrall Manufacturing Co., a Chicago Heights, Ill., division of closely held Duchossois Industries Inc., Elmhurst, Ill.
This year, the railroad holding company acquired 850 such railcars.
Sir Peter Walters, 58-year-old chairman of British Petroleum Co. until next March, joins the board of this cement products company on Dec. 1.
Sir Peter will succeed Sir John Milne, 65, who retires as Blue Circle nonexecutive chairman on June 1.
Bank of New England Corp. said it has held talks with potential merger partners outside New England, although it added that nothing is imminent and it hasn't received any formal offers.
The discussions were disclosed as the bank holding company said that it has dropped its longstanding opposition to full interstate banking bills in Connecticut and in Massachusetts.
Later yesterday, a Massachusetts senate committee approved a bill to allow national interstate banking by banks in the state beginning in 1991.
Currently, both Massachusetts and Connecticut, where most of Bank of New England's operations are, allow interstate banking only within New England.
Richard Driscoll, vice chairman of Bank of New England, told the Dow Jones Professional Investor Report, "Certainly, there are those outside the region who think of us prospectively as a good partner.
We have, and I'm sure others have, considered what our options are, and we've had conversations with people who in the future might prove to be interesting partners."
He added, "There's nothing very hot."
Mr. Driscoll didn't elaborate about who the potential partners were or when the talks were held.
A bank spokeswoman also declined to comment on any merger-related matters, but said the company decided to drop its opposition to the interstate banking legislation because "prevailing sentiment is in favor of passage."
Bank of New England has been hit hard by the region's real-estate slump, with its net income declining 42% to $121.6 million, or 61 cents a share, in the first nine months of 1989 from the year-earlier period.
The company recently said it would sell some operations and lay off 4% of its work force, altogether reducing employment to less than 16,000 from about 18,000.
It recently signed a preliminary agreement to negotiate exclusively with the Bank of Tokyo Ltd. for the sale of part of its leasing business to the Japanese bank.
GOODY PRODUCTS Inc. cut its quarterly dividend to five cents a share from 11.5 cents a share.
The reduced dividend is payable Jan. 2 to stock of record Dec. 15.
The Kearny, N.J.-based maker of hair accessories and other cosmetic products said it cut the dividend due to its third-quarter loss of $992,000, or 15 cents a share.
In the year-ago quarter, the company reported net income of $1.9 million, or 29 cents a share.
The company also adopted an anti-takeover plan.
Michael Henderson, 51-year-old group chief executive of this U.K. metals and industrial materials maker, will become chairman in May, succeeding Ian Butler, 64, who is retiring.
Mr. Butler will remain on the board as a nonexecutive director.
Rally's Inc. said it has redeemed its rights outstanding issued Monday in its shareholder rights plan.
The company said holders of stock of record Nov. 10 will receive 1/10th of one cent a share as the redemption payment.
The fast-food company said its decision was based upon discussions with a shareholder group, Giant Group Ltd., "in an effort to resolve certain disputes with the company."
Giant Group is led by three Rally's directors, Burt Sugarman, James M. Trotter III and William E. Trotter II, who last month indicated they hold a 42.5% stake in Rally's and plan to seek a majority of seats on Rally's nine-member board.
When Warren Winiarski, proprietor of Stag's Leap Wine Cellars in Napa Valley, announced a $75 price tag for his 1985 Cask 23 Cabernet this fall, few wine shops and restaurants around the country balked.
"This is the peak of my wine-making experience," Mr. Winiarski declared when he introduced the wine at a dinner in New York, "and I wanted to single it out as such."
It is in my estimation the best wine Stag's Leap has produced, and with fewer than 700 cases available, it is sure to sell quickly.
The price is a new high for California Cabernet Sauvignon, but it is not the highest.
Diamond Creek 1985 Lake Vineyard Cabernet weighed in this fall with a sticker price of $100 a bottle.
One of the fastest growing segments of the wine market is the category of superpremiums -- wines limited in production, of exceptional quality (or so perceived, at any rate), and with exceedingly high prices.
For years, this group included a stable of classics -- Bordeaux first growths (Lafite-Rothschild, Latour, Haut-Brion, Petrus), Grand Cru Burgundies (Romanee-Conti and La Tache) deluxe Champagnes (Dom Perignon or Roederer Cristal), rarefied sweet wines (Chateau Yquem or Trockenbeerenauslesen Rieslings from Germany, and Biondi-Santi Brunello Riserva from Tuscany).
These first magnitude wines ranged in price from $40 to $125 a bottle.
In the last year or so, however, this exclusive club has taken in a host of flashy new members.
The classics have zoomed in price to meet the competition, and it almost seems that there's a race on to come up with the priciest single bottle, among current releases from every major wine region on the globe.
France can boast the lion's share of high-priced bottles.
Bordeaux's first growths from 1985 and 1986 are $60 to $80 each (except for the smallest in terms of production, Chateau Petrus, which costs around $250!).
These prices seem rather modest, however, in light of other French wines from current vintages.
Chateau Yquem, the leading Sauternes, now goes for well over $100 a bottle for a lighter vintage like 1984; the spectacularly rich 1983 runs $179.
In Champagne, some of the prestige cuvees are inching toward $100 a bottle.
The first Champagne to crack that price barrier was the 1979 Salon de Mesnil Blanc de Blancs.
The'82 Salon is $115.
Roederer Cristal at $90 a bottle sells out around the country and Taittinger's Comtes de Champagne Blanc de Blancs is encroaching upon that level.
The great reds of the Rhone Valley have soared in price as well.
E. Guigal's 1982 Cote Rotie La Landonne, for example, is $120.
None of France's wine regions can steal a march on Burgundy, however.
The six wines of the Domaine de la Romanee-Conti, 72 of the most precious acres of vineyard anywhere in the world, have commanded three-digit price tags for several years now.
With the 1985 vintage, they soared higher: La Tache, $195; Richebourg, $180; Romanee-Conti, $225.
Another small Burgundy estate, Coche-Dury, has just offered its 1987 Corton-Charlemagne for $155.
From Italy there is Angelo Gaja Barbaresco at $125 a bottle, Piero Antinori's La Solaia, a $90 Cabernet from Tuscany, and Biondi-Santi Brunello at $98.
Spain's Vega Secilia Unico 1979 (released only in its 10th year) is $70, as is Australia's Grange Hermitage 1982.
"There are certain cult wines that can command these higher prices," says Larry Shapiro of Marty's, one of the largest wine shops in Dallas.
"What's different is that it is happening with young wines just coming out.
We're seeing it partly because older vintages are growing more scarce."
Wine auctions have almost exhausted the limited supply of those wines, Mr. Shapiro continued: "We've seen a dramatic decrease in demand for wines from the '40s and '50s, which go for $300 to $400 a bottle.
Some of the newer wines, even at $90 to $100 a bottle or so, almost offer a bargain."
Take Lake Vineyard Cabernet from Diamond Creek.
It's made only in years when the grapes ripen perfectly (the last was 1979) and comes from a single acre of grapes that yielded a mere 75 cases in 1987.
Owner Al Brownstein originally planned to sell it for $60 a bottle, but when a retailer in Southern California asked, "Is that wholesale or retail?" he re-thought the matter.
Offering the wine at roughly $65 a bottle wholesale ($100 retail), he sent merchants around the country a form asking them to check one of three answers: 1) no, the wine is too high (2 responses); 2) yes, it's high but I'll take it (2 responses); 3) I'll take all I can get (58 responses).
The wine was shipped in six-bottle cases instead of the usual 12, but even at that it was spread thin, going to 62 retailers in 28 states.
"We thought it was awfully expensive," said Sterling Pratt, wine director at Schaefer's in Skokie, Ill., one of the top stores in suburban Chicago, "but there are people out there with very different opinions of value.
We got our two six-packs -- and they're gone."
Mr. Pratt remarked that he thinks steeper prices have come about because producers don't like to see a hit wine dramatically increase in price later on.
Even if there is consumer resistance at first, a wine that wins high ratings from the critics will eventually move.
"There may be sticker-shock reaction initially," said Mr. Pratt, "but as the wine is talked about and starts to sell, they eventually get excited and decide it's worth the astronomical price to add it to their collection."
"It's just sort of a one-upsmanship thing with some people," added Larry Shapiro.
"They like to talk about having the new Red Rock Terrace {one of Diamond Creek's Cabernets} or the Dunn 1985 Cabernet, or the Petrus.
Producers have seen this market opening up and they're now creating wines that appeal to these people."
That explains why the number of these wines is expanding so rapidly.
But consumers who buy at this level are also more knowledgeable than they were a few years ago.
"They won't buy if the quality is not there," said Cedric Martin of Martin Wine Cellar in New Orleans.
"Or if they feel the wine is overpriced and they can get something equally good for less."
Mr. Martin has increased prices on some wines (like Grgich Hills Chardonnay, now $32) just to slow down movement, but he is beginning to see some resistance to high-priced red Burgundies and Cabernets and Chardonnays in the $30 to $40 range.
Image has, of course, a great deal to do with what sells and what doesn't, and it can't be forced.
Wine merchants can't keep Roederer Cristal in stock, but they have to push Salon le Mesnil, even lowering the price from $115 to $90.
It's hardly a question of quality -- the 1982 Salon is a beautiful wine, but, as Mr. Pratt noted, people have their own ideas about value.
It's interesting to find that a lot of the expensive wines aren't always walking out the door.
In every major market in the U.S., for instance, you can buy'86 La Tache or Richebourg, virtually all of the first growth Bordeaux (except Petrus), as well as Opus One and Dominus from California and, at the moment, the Stag's Leap 1985 Cask 23.
With the biggest wine-buying period of the year looming as the holidays approach, it will be interesting to see how the superpremiums fare.
By January it should be fairly clear what's hot -- and what's not.

Signs of a slowing economy are increasing pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut short-term interest rates, but it isn't clear whether the central bank will do so.
A survey by the Fed's 12 district banks shows economic growth has been sluggish in recent weeks, while upward pressures on prices have moderated.
"The economy is clearly slowing," says Robert Black, president of the Richmond Federal Reserve Bank.
"If you look at the third quarter as posting roughly 2.5% growth, I do see some slowing in the fourth quarter," agrees Kansas City Fed President Roger Guffey.
Nevertheless, both Mr. Guffey and Mr. Black say the slowdown so far is no cause for concern.
"We're coming closer to achieving the stated objective of slowing the economy to a point where hopefully some downward trend in prices will occur," said Mr. Guffey.
Bush administration officials are looking to the Fed to bring down rates, and financial markets seem to be expecting easier credit as well.
"I think the market had been expecting the Fed to ease sooner and a little more than it has to date," said Robert Johnson, vice president of global markets for Bankers Trust Co.
The Fed cut the key federal funds interest rate by about 0.25 percentage point to 8.75% after the Oct. 13 stock market plunge, but has shown no sign of movement since.
The report from the Fed found that manufacturing, in particular, has been weak in recent weeks.
The Philadelphia Fed, for instance, reported that manufacturing activity "continues to decline" for the fourth month in a row.
And in the Chicago district, the report said, "a manufacturer of capital goods noted slower orders for some types, including defense equipment, petroleum equipment, food packaging machinery and material handling equipment."
Retail sales also were reported slow in most districts, particularly "for discretionary, big-ticket items such as furniture, home appliances and consumer electronics."
And construction also was described as slow in most areas.
Despite the economic slowdown, there are few clear signs that growth is coming to a halt.
As a result, Fed officials may be divided over whether to ease credit.
Several Fed governors in Washington have been pushing for easier credit; but many of the regional Fed presidents have been resisting such a move.
Mr. Black said he is "pleased" with the economy's recent performance, and doesn't see "a lot of excesses out there that would tilt us into recession."
"There is always a chance of recession," added Mr. Guffey, "but if you ask me to put a percentage on it, I would think it's well below a 50% chance.
Integra-A Hotel & Restaurant Co. said its planned rights offering to raise about $9 million was declared effective and the company will begin mailing materials to shareholders at the end of this week.
Under the offer, shareholders will receive one right for each 105 common shares owned.
Each right entitles the shareholder to buy $100 face amount of 13.5% bonds due 1993 and warrants to buy 23.5 common shares at 30 cents a share.
The rights, which expire Nov. 21, can be exercised for $100 each.
Integra, which owns and operates hotels, said that Hallwood Group Inc. has agreed to exercise any rights that aren't exercised by other shareholders.
Hallwood, a Cleveland merchant bank, owns about 11% of Integra.
Copperweld Corp., a specialty steelmaker, said 445 workers at a plant in Shelby, Ohio, began a strike after the United Steelworkers Local 3057 rejected a new contract on Tuesday.
The previous contract between Copperweld's Ohio Steel Tube division and the union expired at midnight Tuesday.
The union vote to reject the proposed pact was 230-215.
Copperweld said it doesn't expect a protracted strike.
It said it has taken measures to continue shipments during the work stoppage.
The Treasury said it plans to sell $30 billion in notes and bonds next week, but said the auctions will be postponed unless Congress acts quickly to lift the federal debt ceiling.
Michael Basham, deputy assistant secretary for federal finance, said the Treasury may wait until late Monday or even early Tuesday to announce whether the autions are to be rescheduled.
Unless it can raise money in financial markets, Mr. Basham said, the federal government won't have the cash to pay off $13.8 billion in Treasury bills that mature on Thursday.
Without congressional action, the Treasury can't sell any new securities -- even savings bonds.
But despite partisan bickering over the debt ceiling, which has become entangled in the fight over cutting capital-gains taxes, Congress is almost certain to act in time to avoid default.
"Each day that Congress fails to act... will cause additional disruption in our borrowing schedule, possibly resulting in higher interest costs to the taxpayer," Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said in a speech prepared for delivery last night to a group of bankers.
"To avoid these costs, and a possible default, immediate action is imperative."
The securities to be sold next week will raise about $10 billion in cash and redeem $20 billion in maturing notes.
-- $10 billion of three-year notes, to be auctioned Tuesday and to mature Nov. 15, 1992.
-- $10 billion of 10-year notes, to be auctioned Wednesday and to mature Nov. 15, 1999.
-- $10 billion of 30-year bonds, to be auctioned Thursday and to mature Aug. 15, 2019.
The Treasury also said it plans to sell $10 billion in 36-day cash management bills on Thursday.
They will mature Dec. 21.
None of the securities will be eligible for when-issued trading until Congress approves an increase in the debt ceiling, clearing the way for a formal offering, Mr. Basham said.
The Treasury said it needs to raise $47.5 billion in the current quarter in order to end December with a $20 billion cash balance.
Auctions held in October and those scheduled for next week will raise a total of $25.6 billion.
The remaining $21.9 billion could be raised through the sale of short-term Treasury bills, two-year notes in November and five-year notes in early December, the Treasury said.
In the first three months of 1990, the Treasury estimates that it will have to raise between $45 billion and $50 billion, assuming that it decides to aim for a $10 billion cash balance at the end of March.
Lancaster Colony Corp. said it acquired Reames Foods Inc. in a cash transaction.
Terms weren't disclosed.
Reames, a maker and marketer of frozen noodles and pre-cooked pasta based in Clive, Iowa, has annual sales of about $11 million, Lancaster said.
Investors took advantage of Tuesday's stock rally to book some profits yesterday, leaving stocks up fractionally.
Bond prices and the dollar both gained modestly.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished less than a point higher to close at 2645.90 in moderate trading.
But advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange were tidily ahead of declining stocks, 847 to 644.
Long-term bond prices rose despite prospects of a huge new supply of Treasury debt this month.
Continuing demand for dollars from Japanese investors boosted the U.S. currency.
Analysts were disappointed that the enthusiasm investors showed for stocks in the wake of Georgia-Pacific's $3.18 billion bid for Great Northern Nekoosa evaporated so quickly.
The industrial average jumped more than 41 points Tuesday as speculators rushed to buy shares of potential takeover targets.
Economic news had little effect on financial markets.
As expected, a national purchasing managers' report indicated the nation's manufacturing sector continues to contract modestly.
The Federal Reserve's Beige Book, a summary of economic conditions across the country, indicated that the overall economy remains in a pattern of sluggish growth.
Stock prices rose fractionally in moderate trading.
Big Board volume totaled 154.2 million shares.
Bond prices were up.
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond gained about a quarter of a point, or $2.50 for each $1,000 of face amount.
The yield fell to 7.88%.
The dollar rose.
In late afternoon New York trading the currency was at 1.8500 marks and 143.80 yen compared with 1.8415 marks and 142.85 yen.
Mitsui Mining & Smelting Co. posted a 62% rise in pretax profit to 5.276 billion yen ($36.9 million) in its fiscal first half ended Sept. 30 compared with 3.253 billion yen a year earlier.

Eaton Corp. said it sold its Pacific Sierra Research Corp. unit to a company formed by employees of that unit.
Terms weren't disclosed.
Pacific Sierra, based in Los Angeles, has about 200 employees and supplies professional services and advanced products to industry.
Eaton is an automotive parts, controls and aerospace electronics concern.
Investor Harold Simmons and NL Industries Inc. offered to acquire Georgia Gulf Corp. for $50 a share, or about $1.1 billion, stepping up the pressure on the commodity chemicals concern.
The offer follows an earlier proposal by NL and Mr. Simmons to help Georgia Gulf restructure or go private in a transaction that would pay shareholders $55 a share.
Georgia Gulf rebuffed that offer in September and said it would study other alternatives.
However, it hasn't yet made any proposals to shareholders.
Late yesterday, Georgia Gulf said it reviewed the NL proposal as well as interests from "third parties" regarding business combinations.
Georgia Gulf said it hasn't eliminated any alternatives and that "discussions are being held with interested parties, and work is also continuing on other various transactions."
It didn't elaborate.
Analysts saw the latest offer as proof that Mr. Simmons, an aggressive and persistent investor, won't leave Georgia Gulf alone until some kind of transaction is completed.
"He has clamped on their ankle like a pit bull," says Paul Leming, a vice president with Morgan Stanley & Co.
"He appears to be in it for the long haul."
Mr. Simmons and NL already own a 9.9% stake in Georgia Gulf.
Mr. Simmons owns 88% of Valhi Inc., which in turn owns two-thirds of NL.
NL is officially making the offer.
Mr. Leming wasn't surprised by the lower price cited by NL, saying he believes that $55 a share is "the most you can pay for Georgia Gulf before it becomes a bad acquisition."
Georgia Gulf stock rose $1.75 a share yesterday to close at $51.25 a share, while NL shares closed unchanged at $22.75 and Valhi rose 62.5 cents to $15, all in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
J. Landis Martin, NL president and chief executive officer, said NL and Mr. Simmons cut the price they were proposing for Georgia Gulf because they initially planned a transaction that included about $250 million in equity and a substantial amount of high-yield subordinated debt.
However, the junk-bond market has collapsed in recent weeks, lessening the likelihood that such a transaction would succeed.
Now, he said, the group plans to put in "several hundred million" dollars in equity and finance the remainder with bank debt.
He also said that the group reduced its offer because it wasn't allowed to see Georgia Gulf's confidential financial information without agreeing that it wouldn't make an offer unless it had Georgia Gulf's consent.
In a letter to Georgia Gulf President Jerry R. Satrum, Mr. Martin asked Georgia Gulf to answer its offer by Tuesday.
It wasn't clear how NL and Mr. Simmons would respond if Georgia Gulf spurns them again.
Mr. Martin said they haven't yet decided what their next move would be, but he didn't rule out the possibility of a consent solicitation aimed at replacing Georgia Gulf's board.
In other transactions, Mr. Simmons has followed friendly offers with a hostile tender offer.
Although Georgia Gulf hasn't been eager to negotiate with Mr. Simmons and NL, a specialty chemicals concern, the group apparently believes the company's management is interested in some kind of transaction.
The management group owns about 18% of the stock, most purchased at nominal prices, and would stand to gain millions of dollars if the company were sold.
In the third quarter, Georgia Gulf earned $46.1 million, or $1.85 a share, down from $53 million, or $1.85 a share on fewer shares outstanding.
Sales fell to $251.2 million from $278.7 million.
A licensing company representing the University of Pennsylvania added Johnson & Johnson to its lawsuit challenging a university faculty member over rights to Retin-A acne medicine.
University Patents Inc., based in Westport, Conn., said it seeks Johnson & Johnson's profits from sales of Retin-A, estimated at $50 million, a similar amount of punitive damages and the right to license Retin-A elsewhere.
In May, University Patents filed a suit in federal court in Philadelphia against Albert M. Kligman, a researcher and professor at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine who developed Retin-A in the 1960s to combat acne.
Dr. Kligman patented the medicine while employed by the University, but later licensed the Retin-A to a division of Johnson & Johnson.
In New Brunswick, N.J., a Johnson & Johnson spokesman declined comment.
Criticism in the U.S. over recent Japanese acquisitions is looming ever larger in the two countries' relations.
Officials from both nations say the U.S. public's skittishness about Japanese investment could color a second round of bilateral economic talks scheduled for next week in Washington.
Not that Washington and Tokyo disagree on the Japanese acquisitions; indeed, each has come out in favor of unfettered investment in the U.S..
Where they disagree is on the subject of U.S. direct investment in Japan.
The U.S. wants the removal of what it perceives as barriers to investment; Japan denies there are real barriers.
The heated talk stirred up by recent Japanese investments in the U.S. is focusing attention on the differences in investment climate, even though it's only one of many subjects to be covered in the bilateral talks, known as the Structural Impediments Initiative.
The Japanese "should see this rhetoric as a signal of the need for a change in their own economy," says Charles Dallara, U.S. assistant Treasury secretary, who has been in Tokyo this week informally discussing the impending negotiations with government and business leaders.
"We have a long history of maintaining an open direct-investment policy," Mr. Dallara says.
"U.S. investors should have a greater opportunity at direct investment" in Japan.
The Japanese fret openly about the U.S. public's rancor.
One clear sign of Japan's nervousness came this week, when a spokesman for Japan's Foreign Ministry devoted nearly all of a regular, half-hour briefing for foreign journalists to the subject of recent Japanese investments in the U.S..
"We believe that it is vitally important for those Japanese business interests {in the U.S..} to be more aware of the emotions and concerns of the American people," said the spokesman, Taizo Watanabe.
At the same time, though, he chastised the media for paying such close attention to Japanese investment when other foreign countries, notably Britain, are acquiring more American assets.
Fears that Japanese investors are buying up America have escalated sharply in the past several weeks, with Sony Corp.'s purchase of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. from Coca-Cola Co. and Mitsubishi Estate Co.'s acquisition of a 51% holding in Rockefeller Group, the owner of some of midtown Manhattan's most exclusive real estate.
Even before those moves added fuel, the fires of discontent had been well stoked by the highly publicized experience in Japan of one U.S. investor, T. Boone Pickens Jr.
The Texas oilman has acquired a 26.2% stake valued at more than $1.2 billion in an automotive-lighting company, Koito Manufacturing Co.
But he has failed to gain any influence at the company.
Koito has refused to grant Mr. Pickens seats on its board, asserting he is a greenmailer trying to pressure Koito's other shareholders into buying him out at a profit.
Mr. Pickens made considerable political hay with his troubles in Japan.
The Senate Finance Committee, chaired by a fellow Texan, Democratic Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, last month urged U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills to use Mr. Pickens's experience in talks with Tokyo "to highlight this problem facing Americans who seek access to the Japanese capital markets."
While Mr. Dallara and Japanese officials say the question of investors' access to the U.S. and Japanese markets may get a disproportionate share of the public's attention, a number of other important economic issues will be on the table at next week's talks.
Among them are differences in savings and investment rates, corporate structures and management, and government spending.
Each side has a litany of recommendations for the other.
The U.S. says it is anxious for results.
"We feel very strongly that we really need action across the full range of issues we've identified, and we need it by next spring," Mr. Dallara says.
Both sides have agreed that the talks will be most successful if negotiators start by focusing on the areas that can be most easily changed.
But they haven't clarified what those might be.
After the first set of meetings two months ago, some U.S. officials complained that Japan hadn't come up with specific changes it was prepared to make.
The Japanese retort that the first round was too early to make concessions.
"Just to say the distribution system is wrong doesn't mean anything," says a Ministry of International Trade and Industry official.
"We need to clarify what exactly is wrong with it."
That process of sorting out specifics is likely to take time, the Japanese say, no matter how badly the U.S. wants quick results.
For instance, at the first meeting the two sides couldn't even agree on basic data used in price discussions.
Since then, a team of about 15 MITI and U.S. Commerce Department officials have crossed the globe gauging consumer prices.
By Monday, they hope to have a sheaf of documents both sides can trust.
"Little by little, there is progress," says the MITI official.
"Both sides are taking action."

While worry grows about big Japanese investments in the U.S., Japan's big trading companies are rapidly increasing their stake in America's smaller business.
For Japan, the controversial trend improves access to American markets and technology.
But for small American companies, it also provides a growing source of capital and even marketing help.
Take the deal with Candela Laser Corp., a Wayland, Mass., manufacturer of high-tech medical devices, which three years ago set its sights on Japan as an export market.
Partly to help clear the myriad obstacles facing any overseas company trying to penetrate Japan, tiny Candela turned to Mitsui & Co., one of Japan's largest trading companies, for investment.
In a joint-venture deal, Mitsui guided Candela through Tokyo's bureaucratic maze.
It eventually secured Ministry of Health import approval for two Candela laser products -- one that breaks up kidney stones and another that treats skin lesions.
At last count, Candela had sold $4 million of its medical devices in Japan.
The deal also gave Mitsui access to a high-tech medical product.
"They view this as a growth area so they went about it with a systematic approach," says Richard Olsen, a Candela vice president.
Indeed, for many Japanese trading companies, the favorite U.S. small business is one whose research and development can be milked for future Japanese use.
The Japanese companies bankroll many small U.S. companies with promising products or ideas, frequently putting their money behind projects that commercial banks won't touch.
Japanese companies have financed small and medium-sized U.S. firms for years, but in recent months, the pace has taken off.
In the first half of 1989 alone, Japanese corporations invested $214 million in minority positions in U.S. companies, a 61% rise from the figure for all of 1987, reports Venture Economics Inc.
The Needham, Mass., concern tracks investments in new businesses.
In addition, of course, some of the Japanese investments involved outright purchase of small U.S. firms.
Heightened Japanese interest in American small business parallels an acceleration of investments giving Japanese companies control of large, highly visible U.S. corporations, such as Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.
Only this week, it was announced that Mitsubishi Estate Co. had acquired a 51% stake in Rockefeller Group, which owns New York's prestigious Rockefeller Center.
While the small deals are far less conspicuous, they add to Japanese penetration of the U.S. market.
As the deals also improve Japanese access to American technology and market knowledge, they feed American anxieties in this area, too.
Even a low-tech product like plate glass can catch a trading company's fancy if there's a strategic fit.
Free State Glass Industries of Warrenton, Va., a small fabricator of architectural glass, was foundering under its original management.
Last year, Mitsubishi International Corp., the New York-based arm of Mitsubishi Corp., bought controlling interest in the glass company in a joint venture with Ronald Bodner, a glass industry executive and Mitsubishi consultant.
The deal is chiefly designed to give Mitsubishi a window on the U.S. glass industry, says Ichiro Wakui, an executive in Mitsubishi's general merchandise department in New York.
"It's not just a simple investment in a small company," Mr. Wakui says.
"We want to see the glass market from the inside, not the outside."
Mitsubishi's investment in Free State is "very small... less than $4 million," Mr. Wakui says.
Mr. Bodner declines to comment on the arrangement.
Trading companies such as Mitsubishi, Mitsui, C. Itoh & Co. and Nissho-Iwai Corp., which make many of the Japanese investments in small U.S. concerns, have no U.S. counterpart.
These vertically integrated combines, some of which got their start in Japan's feudal period, deal globally in commodities, construction and manufacturing.
They operate ships and banks.
"All the "sogo-shosha" are looking for new business," says Arthur Klauser, adviser to the president of Mitsui, U.S.A., using the Japanese term for the largest of the global trading houses.
Adds Takeshi Kondo, senior vice president of C. Itoh America Inc.: "We have a great interest in making investments, particularly in new ventures."
A host of electronics firms in California's Silicon Valley were financed with trading-company venture capital.
Profit, at least in the short term, is usually a secondary goal.
"Strategic objectives, not financial return, drive many of the deals," says a Venture Economics spokesman.
In investing on the basis of future transactions, a role often performed by merchant banks, trading companies can cut through the logjam that small-company owners often face with their local commercial banks.
"It's the classic problem of the small businessman," says Malcolm Davies, managing director of Trading Alliance Corp. of New York.
"People are queuing at the door to take his product but he doesn't have the working capital to make the thing and commercial banks are very unsympathetic.
They want assets, they want a balance sheet, which has no relation to the business a company can generate."
Adds Mitsui's Mr. Klauser: "Unlike corporations in this country, trading companies aren't so much interested in a high return on investment as they are on increasing trade flows.
To the extent they can do this, they're quite content to get a return on investment of 1% to 2%."
Mr. Klauser says Mitsui has 75 U.S. subsidiaries in which it holds 35% interest or more and the trading company hopes to double the number of its U.S. affiliates in 1990.
Sales by these subsidiaries in the fiscal year ending last March were more than $17 billion.
A 1% to 2% return on $17 billion "ain't hay," Mr. Klauser says.
Hudson General Corp.'s president and chief executive officer, Alan J. Stearn, resigned.
Mr. Stearn, 46 years old, couldn't be reached for comment.
A company spokesman declined to elaborate on the departure.
Hudson General, which provides maintenance, fueling and other services to airlines and airports, reported a loss for its most recent fiscal year and last month omitted the semiannual dividend on its common shares.
Mr. Stearn, who had been with the company more than 20 years and had been president since 1984, will act as a consultant to Hudson General.
His duties as chief executive will be assumed by Chairman Jay B. Langner.
For 10 years, Genie Driskill went to her neighborhood bank because it was convenient.
A high-balance customer that banks pine for, she didn't give much thought to the rates she was receiving, nor to the fees she was paying.
But in August, First Atlanta National Bank introduced its Crown Account, a package designed to lure customers such as Ms. Driskill.
Among other things, it included checking, safe deposit box and credit card -- all for free -- plus a good deal on installment loans.
All she had to do was put $15,000 in a certificate of deposit, or qualify for a $10,000 personal line of credit.
"I deserve something for my loyalty," she says.
She took her business to First Atlanta.
So it goes in the competitive world of consumer banking these days.
For nearly a decade, banks have competed for customers primarily with the interest rates they pay on their deposits and charge on their loans.
The competitive rates were generally offset by hefty fees on various services.
But many banks are turning away from strict price competition.
Instead, they are trying to build customer loyalty by bundling their services into packages and targeting them to small segments of the population.
"You're dead in the water if you aren't segmenting the market," says Anne Moore, president of Synergistics Research Corp., a bank consulting firm in Atlanta.
NCNB Corp. of Charlotte, N.C., recently introduced its Financial Connections Program aimed at young adults just starting careers.
The program not only offers a pre-approved car loan up to $18,000, but throws in a special cash-flow statement to help in saving money.
In September, Union Planters Corp. of Memphis, Tenn., launched The Edge account, a package designed for the "thirtysomething" crowd with services that include a credit card and line of credit with no annual fees, and a full percentage point off on installment loans.
The theory: Such individuals, many with young children, are in their prime borrowing years -- and, having borrowed from the bank, they may continue to use it for other services in later years.
For some time, banks have been aiming packages at the elderly, the demographic segment with the highest savings.
Those efforts are being stepped up.
Judie MacDonald, vice president of retail sales at Barnett Banks Inc. of Jacksonville, Fla., says the company now targets sub-segments within the market by tailoring its popular Seniors Partners Program to various life styles.
"Varying age, geography and life-style differences create numerous sub-markets," Ms. MacDonald says.
She says individual Barnett branches can add different benefits to their Seniors Partners package -- such as athletic activities or travel clubs -- to appeal to local market interests.
"An active 55-year-old in Boca Raton may care more about Senior Olympic games, while a 75-year-old in Panama City may care more about a seminar on health," she says.
Banks have tried packaging before.
In 1973, Wells Fargo & Co. of San Francisco launched the Gold Account, which included free checking, a credit card, safe-deposit box and travelers checks for a $3 monthly fee.
The concept begot a slew of copycats, but the banks stopped promoting the packages.
One big reason: thin margins.
Many banks, particularly smaller ones, were slow to computerize and couldn't target market niches that would have made the programs more profitable.
As banks' earnings were squeezed in the mid-1970s, the emphasis switched to finding ways to cut costs.
But now computers are enabling more banks to analyze their customers by age, income and geography.
They are better able to get to those segments in the wake of the deregulation that began in the late 1970s.
Deregulation has effectively removed all restrictions on what banks can pay for deposits, as well as opened up the field for new products such as high-rate CDs.
Where a bank once offered a standard passbook savings account, it began offering money-market accounts, certificates of deposit and interest-bearing checking, and staggering rates based on the size of deposits.
The competition has grown more intense as bigger banks such as Norwest Corp. of Minneapolis and Chemical Banking Corp. of New York extend their market-share battles into small towns across the nation.
"Today, a banker is worrying about local, regional and money-center {banks}, as well as thrifts and credit unions," says Ms. Moore at Synergistics Research.
"So people who weren't even thinking about targeting 10 years ago are scrambling to define their customer base."
The competition has cultivated a much savvier consumer.
"The average household will spread 19 accounts over a dozen financial institutions," says Michael P. Sullivan, who runs his own bank consulting firm in Charlotte, N.C.
"This much fragmentation makes attracting and keeping today's rate-sensitive customers costly."
Packages encourage loyalty by rewarding customers for doing the bulk of their banking in one place.
For their troubles, the banks get a larger captive audience that is less likely to move at the drop of a rate.
The more accounts customers have, Mr. Sullivan says, the more likely they are to be attracted to a package -- and to be loyal to the bank that offers it.
That can pay off down the road as customers, especially the younger ones, change from borrowers to savers/investors.
Packaging has some drawbacks.
The additional technology, personnel training and promotional effort can be expensive.
Chemical Bank spent more than $50 million to introduce its ChemPlus line, several packages aimed at different segments, in 1986, according to Thomas Jacob, senior vice president of marketing.
"It's not easy to roll out something that comprehensive, and make it pay," Mr. Jacob says.
Still, bankers expect packaging to flourish, primarily because more customers are demanding that financial services be tailored to their needs.
"These days, banking customers walk in the door expecting you to have a package especially for them," Ms. Moore says.
Some banks are already moving in that direction, according to Alvin T. Sale, marketing director at First Union Corp. in Charlotte.
First Union, he says, now has packages for seven customer groups.
Soon, it will split those into 30.
Says Mr. Sale: "I think more banks are starting to realize that we have to be more like the department store, not the boutique."

SHAREDATA Inc. said it will amend a registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to delete a plan to sell 500,000 newly issued common shares.
The Chandler, Ariz., company said it will resubmit the registration to cover only the 2.3 million warrants, each exercisable for the purchase of one common share.
Currently, ShareData has about 4.1 million common shares outstanding.
ShareData develops and markets low-cost software, peripheral equipment and accessories for computers.

2. Take a Hawaiian vacation.
3. Send your child to a university.
4. Buy a diamond necklace.
5. Make a lasting difference in the regulatory life of an American savings-and-loan association through the Foster Corporate Parents Plan.
Americans today spend $15,000 like pocket change -- they don't think much about it.
But for an ailing savings-and-loan association -- teetering on insolvency -- it can lead to safety from imminent demise and to a future full of promise.
Your $15,000 will help keep a needy savings and loan solvent -- and out of the federal budget deficit.
As a Foster Corporate Parent, you'll be helping a neighborhood S&L in areas crucial to its survival.
Like healthy regulatory capital.
A steady deposit base.
Performing loans.
At the same time, you'll give your Foster Savings Institution the gift of hope and freedom from the federal regulators who want to close its doors -- for good.
As a Foster Corporate Parent, you will experience the same joy felt by Robert Bass, Lewis Ranieri, William Simon and others, who find ways to help troubled savings institutions and their employees help themselves.
That builds confidence, self sufficiency, not to mention critical regulatory net worth.
Don't wait -- a savings institution needs your help now!
Every day you delay, a savings institution's health -- and the federal budget deficit -- grows worse.
Think about the good you can do for just $15,000 a month, about the cost of a mid-size Chevrolet or two semesters at a state university.
Then send your support to a savings institution that has taken a bad rap in the press and on its bottom line.
Every $15,000 you send will go a long way to boost sagging net worth and employee morale -- and keep your Foster Savings Institution off the federal budget deficit!
Mr. Baris is a lawyer in New York.
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange said it plans to institute an additional "circuit breaker" aimed at stemming market slides.
Separately, John Phelan told a closed House subcommittee meeting in Washington that he would support Securities and Exchange Commission halts of program trading during market emergencies.
But the New York Stock Exchange chairman said he doesn't support reinstating a "collar" on program trading, arguing that firms could get around such a limit.
The Chicago Merc said a new one-hour price limit would take effect in its Standard & Poor's 500 stock-index futures pit once S&P 500 futures fell 20 index points -- the equivalent of about a 150-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
If the 20-point limit is triggered after 1:30 p.m. Chicago time, it would remain in effect until the normal close of trading at 3:15 p.m.
With the limit in effect, members would be able to execute trades at the limit price or at higher prices, but not below it.
The exchange said it decided a new circuit breaker was needed following a review of the tumultuous trading in stocks and stock-index futures on Friday Oct. 13, when the Dow Jones industrials plunged 190 points and stock-index futures prices skidded as well.
Late that afternoon the S&P 500 stock-index futures contract fell a total of 30 index points, hitting a Merc circuit breaker limit that remained in effect for the rest of the trading session.
The Merc said that its existing 30-minute, 12-point limit on S&P 500 stock-index futures trading (equal to about 100 points on the Dow Jones industrials), which was triggered Oct. 13, will remain in effect.
Leo Melamed, Merc executive committee chairman, said that the 12-point limit appeared to lessen the selling panic Oct. 13.
But when the contract reopened, the subsequent flood of sell orders that quickly knocked the contract down to the 30-point limit indicated that the intermediate limit of 20 points was needed to help keep stock and stock-index futures prices synchronized.
Several traders maintained that the Merc's 12-point circuit-breaker aggravated the market slide Oct. 13 by directing additional selling pressure to the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.
All of the changes require regulatory approval, which is expected shortly.
The exchange also said that the 30-point circuit breaker, which currently provides only a one-hour respite during market sell-offs, will become the maximum one-day limit for the S&P 500 stock-index futures contract; the one-day limit now is 50 index points.
A final modification was made to the five-point opening limit for the contract.
The Merc said that five-point limit will remain in effect for the first 10 minutes of trading.
The limit lapses under current exchange rules if contracts trade above the limit price during the opening 10 minutes of trading.
In Washington, House aides said Mr. Phelan told congressmen that the collar, which banned program trades through the Big Board's computer when the Dow Jones Industrial Average moved 50 points, didn't work well.
He said that firms could get around the collar by executing trades manually.
In a post-hearing news conference, Mr. Phelan, who has publicly expressed concern about market volatility, said he told the House finance and telecommunications subcommittee that he would support the program-trading halt proposal "providing the SEC would be comfortable with the language" in a bill.
The program-trading issue is heating up on Capitol Hill as it is on Wall Street, and several legislators want to grant the SEC the power to shut off the programs when trading becomes too volatile.
SEC Chairman Richard Breeden has said he would be willing to consider circuit breakers that have preset trigger points, but he doesn't want discretionary power to stop programs.
A House aide suggested that Mr. Phelan was so "vague and mushy" that it was the kind of meeting where people of all viewpoints could "come out feeling good."
At one point, Mr. Phelan angered the subcommittee's chairman, Rep. Edward Markey (D., Mass.), by not going much beyond what already had been reported in the morning newspapers.
"Markey said we could have done this in public" because so little sensitive information was disclosed, the aide said.
Mr. Phelan then responded that he would have been happy just writing a report to the panel, the aide added.
At another point during the hearing, Rep. Markey asked Mr. Phelan what would be discussed at a New York exchange board meeting today.
Mr. Phelan said the Big Board is likely to study the program-trading issue.
That response annoyed Rep. Markey, House aides said, and the congressman snapped back that there had been enough studies of the issue and that it was time for action on the matter.
Fifteen of the 26 subcommittee members attended the hearing, most notably Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.), the full House Energy and Commerce Committee chairman, who has been willing to let Mr. Markey carry the legislation in recent months.
Mr. Dingell expressed concern, sources said, about jurisdictional problems in regulating program trading, which uses futures to offset stock trades.
The futures industry is regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which reports to the Agriculture committees in both houses.
The art of change-ringing is peculiar to the English, and, like most English peculiarities, unintelligible to the rest of the world.
-- Of all scenes that evoke rural England, this is one of the loveliest: An ancient stone church stands amid the fields, the sound of bells cascading from its tower, calling the faithful to evensong.
The parishioners of St. Michael and All Angels stop to chat at the church door, as members here always have.
In the tower, five men and women pull rhythmically on ropes attached to the same five bells that first sounded here in 1614.
But there is also a discordant, modern note in Aslacton, though it can't be heard by the church-goers enjoying the peal of bells this cool autumn evening.
Like most of the other 6,000 churches in Britain with sets of bells, St. Michael once had its own "band" of ringers, who would herald every Sunday morning and evening service.
Now, only one local ringer remains: 64-year-old Derek Hammond.
The others here today live elsewhere.
They belong to a group of 15 ringers -- including two octogenarians and four youngsters in training -- who drive every Sunday from church to church in a sometimes-exhausting effort to keep the bells sounding in the many belfries of East Anglia.
"To ring for even one service at this tower, we have to scrape," says Mr. Hammond, a retired water-authority worker.
"We've tried to train the youngsters, but they have their discos and their dances, and they just drift away."
Mr. Hammond worries that old age and the flightiness of youth will diminish the ranks of the East Anglian group that keeps the Aslacton bells pealing.
History, after all, is not on his side.
According to a nationwide survey taken a year ago, nearly a third of England's church bells are no longer rung on Sundays because there is no one to ring them.
It is easy to see why the ancient art is on the ropes.
The less complicated version of playing tunes on bells, as do the carillons of continental Europe, is considered by the English to be childish, fit only for foreigners.
Change-ringing, a mind-boggling exercise the English invented 380 years ago, requires physical dexterity -- some bells weigh more than a ton -- combined with intense mental concentration.
Proper English bells are started off in "rounds," from the highest-pitched bell to the lowest -- a simple descending scale using, in larger churches, as many as 12 bells.
Then, at a signal, the ringers begin varying the order in which the bells sound without altering the steady rhythm of the striking.
Each variation, or change, can occur only once, the rules state.
Ringers memorize patterns of changes, known as "methods," which have odd-sounding names like Kent Treble Bob Major or Grandsire Caters.
A series of 5,000 or so changes is a "peal" and takes about three hours.
A look at a Thursday night practice at St. Mary Abbot church in the Kensington district of London gives an idea of the work involved.
Ten shirt-sleeved ringers stand in a circle, one foot ahead of the other in a prize-fighter's stance, each pulling a rope that disappears through a small hole in the high ceiling of the ringing chamber.
No one speaks, and the snaking of the ropes seems to make as much sound as the bells themselves, muffled by the ceiling.
Totally absorbed, the ringers stare straight ahead, using peripheral vision (they call it "rope-sight") to watch the other ropes and thus time their pulls.
Far above in the belfry, the huge bronze bells, mounted on wheels, swing madly through a full 360 degrees, starting and ending, surprisingly, in the inverted, or mouth-up position.
Skilled ringers use their wrists to advance or retard the next swing, so that one bell can swap places with another in the following change.
In a well-known detective-story involving church bells, English novelist Dorothy L. Sayers described ringing as a "passion {that} finds its satisfaction in mathematical completeness and mechanical perfection."
Ringers, she added, are "filled with the solemn intoxication that comes of intricate ritual faultlessly performed."
"Ringing does become a bit of an obsession," admits Stephanie Pattenden, master of the band at St. Mary Abbot and one of England's best female ringers.
It is a passion that usually stays in the tower, however.
More often than not, ringers think of the church as something stuck on the bottom of the belfry.
When their changes are completed, and after they have worked up a sweat, ringers often skip off to the local pub, leaving worship for others below.
This does not sit well with some clerics.
With membership of the Church of England steadily dwindling, strong-willed vicars are pressing equally strong-willed and often non-religious ringers to attend services.
Two years ago, the Rev. Jeremy Hummerstone, vicar of Great Torrington, Devon, got so fed up with ringers who didn't attend service he sacked the entire band; the ringers promptly set up a picket line in protest.
"They were a self-perpetuating club that treated the tower as sort of a separate premises," the Vicar Hummerstone says.
An entirely new band rings today at Great Torrington, several of whom are members of the congregation.
But there still aren't enough ringers to ring more than six of the eight bells.
At St. Mary's Church in Ilminster, Somerset, the bells have fallen silent following a dust-up over church attendance.
The vicar, W.D. Jones, refuses to talk about it, saying it would "reopen the wound."
But C.J.B. Marshall, vicar of a nearby church, feels the fault is in the stairs from the bell tower that are located next to the altar.
"So crunch, crunch, crunch, bang, bang, bang -- here come the ringers from above, making a very obvious exit while the congregation is at prayer," he says.
Vicar Marshall admits to mixed feelings about this issue, since he is both a vicar and an active bell-ringer himself.
"The sound of bells is a net to draw people into the church," he says.
"I live in hopes that the ringers themselves will be drawn into that fuller life."
The Central Council of Church Bell Ringers, a sort of parliament of ringing groups, aims to improve relations with vicars, says John C. Baldwin, president.
It hopes to speak to students at theological colleges about the joys of bell ringing and will shortly publish a booklet for every vicar in the country entitled, "The Bells in Your Care."
Says Mr. Baldwin, "We recognize that we may no longer have as high a priority in church life and experience."
Mr. Baldwin is also attacking the greater problem: lack of ringers.
One survey says that of the 100,000 trained bellringers in England today, only 40,000 of them still ring.
Also, ringers don't always live where the bells need to be rung -- like in small, rural parishes and inner-city churches.
But the council's program to attract and train ringers is only partly successful, says Mr. Baldwin.
"Right now, we're lucky if after five years we keep one new ringer out of 10," he adds.
One bright sign is that a growing number of women have entered the once male-dominated field; more than a third of the ringers today are women.
They aren't accepted everywhere, however.
The oldest bell-ringing group in the country, the Ancient Society of College Youths, founded in 1637, remains male-only, a fact that's particularly galling to women because the group is the sole source of ringers for Britain's most prestigious churches, St. Paul's Cathedral and Westminster Abbey.
This being Britain, no woman has filed an equal-opportunity suit, but the extent of the problem surfaced this summer in a series of letters to "The Ringing World," a weekly newspaper for ringers.
One writer, signing his letter as "Red-blooded, balanced male," remarked on the "frequency of women fainting in peals," and suggested that they "settle back into their traditional role of making tea at meetings."
In the torrent of replies that followed, one woman ringer from Solihull observed that "the average male ringer leaves quite a lot to be desired: badly dressed, decorated with acne and a large beer-belly, frequently unwashed and unbearably flatulent in peals."
Another women wrote from Sheffield to say that in her 60 years of ringing, "I have never known a lady to faint in the belfry.
I have seen one or two men die, bless them.
Investors unsettled by the stock market's gyrations can take some comfort in the predictable arrival of quarterly dividend checks.
That has been particularly true this year with many companies raising their payouts more than 10%.
But don't breathe too easy: Those dividend increases may signal trouble ahead for stock prices, some analysts warn.
In the past, they say, the strongest dividend growth has often come at times when the stock-market party was almost over.
That can be a trap for unwary investors, says Richard Bernstein, senior quantitative analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co.
Strong dividend growth, he says, is "the black widow of valuation" -- a reference to the female spiders that attract males and then kill them after mating.
Stephen Boesel, president of T. Rowe Price Growth and Income Fund, explains that companies raise their payouts most robustly only after the economy and corporate profits have been growing for some time.
"Invariably, those strong periods in the economy give way to recessionary environments," he says.
"And recessionary environments aren't hospitable to the stock market."
Indeed, analysts say that payouts have sometimes risen most sharply when prices were already on their way down from cyclical peaks.
In 1976, for example, dividends on the stocks in Standard & Poor's 500-stock index soared 10%, following much slower growth the year before.
The S&P index started sliding in price in September 1976, and fell 12% in 1977 -- despite a 15% expansion in dividends that year.
That pattern hasn't always held, but recent strong growth in dividends makes some market watchers anxious.
Payouts on the S&P 500 stocks rose 10% in 1988, according to Standard & Poor's Corp., and Wall Street estimates for 1989 growth are generally between 9% and 14%.
Many people believe the growth in dividends will slow next year, although a minority see double-digit gains continuing.
Meanwhile, many market watchers say recent dividend trends raise another warning flag: While dividends have risen smartly, their expansion hasn't kept pace with even stronger advances in stock prices.
As a result, the market's dividend yield -- dividends as a percentage of price -- has slid to a level that is fairly low and unenticing by historical standards.
Put another way, the decline in the yield suggests stocks have gotten pretty rich in price relative to the dividends they pay, some market analysts say.
They are keeping a close watch on the yield on the S&P 500.
The figure is currently about 3.3%, up from 3.2% before the recent market slide.
Some analysts say investors should run for the exits if a sustained market rebound pushes the yield below 3%.
A drop below that 3% benchmark "has always been a strong warning sign that stocks are fully valued," says Mr. Boesel of T. Rowe Price.
In fact, "the market has always tanked.
Always.
There's never been an exception," says Gerald W. Perritt, a Chicago investment adviser and money manager, based on a review of six decades of stock-market data.
The last time the S&P 500 yield dropped below 3% was in the summer of 1987.
Stockholders who took the hint and sold shares escaped the October debacle.
There have been only seven other times -- in 1929, 1933, 1961, 1965, 1968, 1971 and 1972 -- when the yield on the S&P 500 dropped below 3% for at least two consecutive months, Mr. Perritt found.
And in each case, he says, a sharp drop in stock prices began within a year.
Still, some market analysts say the current 3.3% reading isn't as troublesome as it might have been in years past.
"It's not a very meaningful indicator currently because corporations are not behaving in a traditional manner," says James H. Coxon, head of stock investments for Cigna Corp., the Philadelphia-based insurer.
In particular, Mr. Coxon says, businesses are paying out a smaller percentage of their profits and cash flow in the form of dividends than they have historically.
So, while stock prices may look fairly high relative to dividends, they are not excessive relative to the underlying corporate strength.
Rather than increasing dividends, some companies have used cash to buy back some of their shares, notes Steven G. Einhorn, co-chairman of the investment policy committee at Goldman, Sachs & Co.
He factors that into the market yield to get an adjusted yield of about 3.6%.
That is just a tad below the average of the past 40 years or so, he says.
What will happen to dividend growth next year?
Common wisdom suggests a single-digit rate of growth, reflecting a weakening in the economy and corporate profits.
PaineWebber Inc., for instance, is forecasting growth in S&P 500 dividends of just under 5% in 1990, down from an estimated 11% this year.
In other years in which there have been moderate economic slowdowns -- the environment the firm expects in 1990 -- the change in dividends ranged from a gain of 4% to a decline of 1%, according to PaineWebber analyst Thomas Doerflinger.
The minority argument, meanwhile, is that businesses have the financial wherewithal this time around to declare sharply higher dividends even if their earnings weaken.
Dividend growth on the order of 12% is expected by both Mr. Coxon of Cigna and Mr. Einhorn of Goldman Sachs.
Those dividend bulls argue that corporations are in the unusual position of having plenty of cash left over after paying dividends and making capital expenditures.
One indicator investors might want to watch is the monthly tally from Standard & Poor's of the number of public companies adjusting their dividends.
A total of 139 companies raised dividends in October, basically unchanged from 138 a year ago, S&P said Wednesday.
That followed four straight months in which the number of increases trailed the year-earlier pace.
While the S&P tally doesn't measure the magnitude of dividend changes, a further slippage in the number of dividend increases could be a harbinger of slower dividend growth next year.
In any case, opinion is mixed on how much of a boost the overall stock market would get even if dividend growth continues at double-digit levels.
Mr. Einhorn of Goldman Sachs estimates the stock market will deliver a 12% to 15% total return from appreciation and dividends over the next 12 months -- vs. a "cash rate of return" of perhaps 7% or 8% if dividend growth is weak.
But Mr. Boesel of T. Rowe Price, who also expects 12% growth in dividends next year, doesn't think it will help the overall market all that much.
"Having the dividend increases is a supportive element in the market outlook, but I don't think it's a main consideration," he says.
With slower economic growth and flat corporate earnings likely next year, "I wouldn't look for the market to have much upside from current levels.
Your Oct. 13 page-one story on the renewed plight of Western Union says that Western Union had lost its chance to be in the telephone business by turning down Alexander Graham Bell's offer to it of his invention, because it supposedly felt that voice communication would never replace the telegraph.
Such is hardly the case.
Bell's father-in-law, Gardner G. Hubbard, wealthy and well-connected, obtained financing to start the American Bell Telephone Co. in Boston, which even had a subsidiary in New York called the Telephone Co. of New York.
This is where Bell's patents went.
Western Union indeed wanted to get into the telephone business.
It acquired Thomas Edison's microphone patent and then immediately sued the Bell Co. claiming that the microphone invented by my grandfather, Emile Berliner, which had been sold to Bell for a princely $50,000, infringed upon Western Union's Edison patent.
When Bell established that the Berliner patent caveat was registered 10 days before Edison's application, Western Union dropped the lawsuit and agreed never to enter the telephone business -- the basis for the company's current plight.

Troubled NBI Inc. said it fired more than half its work force and is discontinuing its hardware business to focus on its software and service operations.
The ailing company, which has reported net losses for 16 consecutive quarters, said it won't manufacture network computer systems any more and will greatly reduce its costly direct sales force.
Altogether, NBI said it will eliminate 266 jobs at its Boulder headquarters, 176 field sales jobs and 50 jobs at its Canadian and United Kingdom headquarters.
The company's work force will fall to about 400 people.
Stephen G. Jerritts, president and chief executive officer, said customers weren't willing to commit to an expensive NBI hardware systems because of the company's financial troubles.
Further, he said, the company doesn't have the capital needed to build the business over the next year or two.
"We flat ran out of financing resources," Mr. Jerritts said.
"We had to do something structurally and radically different."
As a result, he said NBI will focus on servicing its installed base of systems, trying to provide maintenance for other manufacturers and expanding its software business, using some of the applications it developed for its hardware.
The company currently offers a word-processing package for personal computers called Legend.
The company, which recently said it lacked the profits and capital to pay dividends on its Series A convertible preferred stock, said it has hired an investment banker to help it raise additional cash.
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, NBI common closed at 93 cents a share, up 31 cents.
It was Richard Nixon's first visit to China in 1972 that set in motion the historic rapprochement between Beijing and Washington.
But the former U.S. president's sixth visit to China, during which he spoke at length with Chinese leaders, was nowhere near as successful at easing strains that have recently afflicted the Sino-U.S. relationship.
Mr. Nixon, the most prominent American to come to China since Beijing's bloody suppression of pro-democracy demonstrators in June, harped on international outrage over the massacre.
The Chinese, in turn, took aim at American "interference" in China's domestic affairs.
One official newspaper, Legal Daily, even directly criticized Mr. Nixon, who is normally referred to here as an "old friend."
The paper accused him of being a leading proponent of "peaceful evolution," a catch phrase to describe what China believes is the policy of Western countries to seduce socialist nations into the capitalist sphere.
The tension was evident on Wednesday evening during Mr. Nixon's final banquet toast, normally an opportunity for reciting platitudes about eternal friendship.
Instead, Mr. Nixon reminded his host, Chinese President Yang Shangkun, that Americans haven't forgiven China's leaders for the military assault of June 3-4 that killed hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of demonstrators.
"Many in the United States, including many friends of China, believe the crackdown was excessive and unjustified," Mr. Nixon told Mr. Yang, who was directly involved in ordering the attack.
"The events of April through June damaged the respect and confidence which most Americans previously had for the leaders of China."
The Chinese responded in an equally undiplomatic fashion.
In talks with Mr. Nixon, Chinese leaders expressed no regret for the killings, and even suggested that the U.S. was prominently involved in the demonstrations this spring.
In a meeting Tuesday, supreme leader, Deng Xiaoping, told Mr. Nixon, "Frankly speaking, the U.S. was involved too deeply in the turmoil and counterrevolutionary rebellion which occurred in Beijing not long ago.
China was the real victim and it is unjust to reprove China for it."
Despite the harsh exchanges, the U.S. and China still seem to be looking for a way to mend relations, which have deteriorated into what Mr. Nixon referred to as "the greatest crisis in Chinese-American relations" since his initial visit to China 17 years ago.
In his return toast to Mr. Nixon, Mr. Yang said the relationship had reached a "stalemate."
Relations between China and the U.S. have been tense since June 7, when Chinese dissident Fang Lizhi and his wife, Li Shuxian, took refuge in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing.
Shortly afterwards, Mr. Bush imposed a series of anti-China sanctions, including suspension of most high-level talks, which could be codified in U.S. congressional legislation in the coming weeks.
Mr. Nixon is traveling in China as a private citizen, but he has made clear that he is an unofficial envoy for the Bush administration.
Mr. Nixon met Mr. Bush and his national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, before coming to China on Saturday.
And he plans to brief the president at the end of the week, U.S. sources said.
Mr. Nixon was to leave China today.
According to an American member of the Nixon party, the former president raised a number of controversial issues in his 20 hours of talks with top-level Chinese officials.
These included China's economic policies, human rights and the question of Mr. Fang.
Mr. Nixon also proposed that China restore its participation in the Fulbright Program, a U.S. government-funded academic exchange.
China pulled out of the program in July.
In his talks, the former president urged China's leaders to acknowledge that their nation is part of the world community and welcome the infusion of outside contacts and ideas.
"Ideas are going over borders, and there's no SDI ideological weapon that can shoot them down," he told a group of Americans at the U.S. Embassy on Wednesday.
There are no signs, however, of China's yielding on key issues.
But in one minor matter, Mr. Nixon appears to have gained a concession.
In a meeting with Premier Li Peng on Monday, Mr. Nixon said that he hoped he wouldn't encounter guards with machine guns during his visit to the U.S. Embassy.
Sure enough, when he arrived at the embassy two days later, the machine-gun-toting guards were gone -- for the first time in five months.
A few blocks away, at the U.S. ambassador's residence, the guards encircling the compound also had discarded their Uzi-model arms for the first time since early June.
But the guards there retained their pistols, and a large contingent of plainclothes police remained nearby in unmarked cars.
Moreover, police and soldiers continue to harass Americans, who have filed several protests with the Foreign Ministry in the past week.
Several times, Chinese guards have pointed their automatic rifles at young children of U.S. diplomats and clicked the trigger.
The rifles weren't loaded.
Your Oct. 6 article "Japan's Financial Firms Lure Science Graduates" states, "Industrial companies are accusing financial institutions of jeopardizing Japan's economy by raising the salary stakes for new employees."
The Japanese industrial companies should know better.
They are barking up the wrong tree, because it is basically their fault they can't attract new employees.
Takuma Yamamoto, president of Fujitsu Ltd., believes "the `money worship' among young people... caused the problem."
He is just passing the buck to young people.
What's wrong with asking for more money?
Money is not everything, but it is necessary, and business is not volunteer work.
It is not unethical to choose a higher-salaried job.
Unfortunately, Japanese manufacturers have neither good working conditions nor good compensation packages.
I get the impression that some Japanese managers believe working harder for less money is beautiful.
I visited a lot of major Japanese manufacturers, but I never felt I would want to be employed by any of them.
Many of them recently have been spending a lot of money on public relations and advertising to improve their images, but they should realize that the most important thing is real change, not changing people's perceptions.
If the Japanese companies are seriously considering their survival, they could do at least three things to improve the situation: raise salaries higher than those of financial institutions; improve working conditions (better offices and more vacations, for example); accept and hire more labor from outside Japan.
In reference to your Oct. 9 page-one article "Barbara Bush Earns Even Higher Ratings Than the President," it is regrettable that you must continually define blacks by our negatives: "Among liberals, 60% have positive views of her, while 50% approve of the president's job performance.
In part, this may reflect the fact that `she speaks a more progressive language' than her husband, as Columbia's Prof. {Ethel} Klein puts it.
Among professionals, 76% have a favorable opinion of her, compared to 62% who approve of her husband's performance.
While a quarter of black voters disapprove of Mr. Bush's handling of his job, only 15% have a negative view of his spouse."
The statistics imply that three-quarters of blacks approve of Mr. Bush's job performance and 85% of blacks approve of Mrs. Bush.
If the assumption is that it is surprising that so few blacks find Mr. and Mrs. Bush distasteful, the positive view is even more newsworthy.
Such an editorial point of view perpetuates an insidious, stereotyped perspective.
Why are we blacks continually defined by our minority and the lowest common denominator.

"I never had any clients at all.
It was just a stupid mistake to get the license," he said, adding, "I'd just as soon not get into" details of the settlement.
Program traders are fond of predicting that if they are blocked in the U.S., they will simply emigrate to foreign stock markets.
But in London and Tokyo, where computer-driven trading now plays a small but growing role, traders say a number of hurdles loom.
Government officials, especially in Japan, probably would resist any onslaught of program trading by players trying to shrug off the U.S. furor over their activities and marching abroad with their business.
Japan is "very concerned" about the possible effects of program trading, a senior Japanese official said after the Oct. 13 stock plunge in New York.
U.S. stock-index futures aren't even traded in Japan now.
And because of the time difference, the Japanese and the U.S. markets' trading hours don't overlap.
It all adds up to a barrier to American-style index arbitrage, the most popular form of U.S. program trading that seeks to exploit brief differences between prices of stocks in New York and the price of a futures contract in Chicago based on those stocks.
About 11.6% of all program trading by New York Stock Exchange firms in September took place in foreign markets, according to Big Board data.
Yet it is difficult to imagine Japan racing to introduce Chicago-style stock-index futures.
Japan's Finance Ministry already is scrutinizing institutional investors' activity to see whether policy changes are needed to cope with the current level of program trading, said Makato Utsumi, vice minister for international finance.
Program trading has taken off in Japan since last year's introduction of home-market stock-index futures trading on the Tokyo and Osaka stock exchanges.
But regulators are wary.
They haven't forgotten the leap in share prices last Dec. 7, when the first bout of foreign-led index arbitrage drove stocks skyward in the last half-hour of trading, startling regulators who thought they had written enough rules to prevent such a swing.
Japan's Finance Ministry had set up mechanisms to limit how far futures prices could fall in a single session and to give market operators the authority to suspend trading in futures at any time.
"Maybe it wasn't enough," a Finance Ministry official noted after the Dec. 7 surge.
Japan's regulators have since tightened controls on index-related stock purchases.
Tokyo's leading program traders are the big U.S. securities houses, though the Japanese are playing catch-up.
Some U.S. firms, notably Salomon Inc. and Morgan Stanley Group Inc., have reaped a hefty chunk of their Japanese earnings from index arbitrage, both for customers and for their own accounts.
Both Deryck C. Maughan, who heads Salomon in Tokyo, and John S. Wadsworth, who heads Morgan Stanley there, ascribe a good part of their firms' success in Tokyo to their ability to offer sophisticated, futures-related investment strategies to big institutional clients.
They don't have plans to cut back.
"It has not been disruptive in the markets here," Mr. Maughan said.
"The real difference seems to be that the cash market here... is big enough and liquid enough that the futures market isn't having the same impact it does in America."
The British also are scrutinizing program trades.
Index-arbitrage trading is "something we want to watch closely," an official at London's Stock Exchange said.
"We don't think there is cause for concern at the moment."
London serves increasingly as a conduit for program trading of U.S. stocks.
Market professionals said London has several attractions.
First, the trading is done over the counter and isn't reported on either the U.S. or London stock trading tapes.
Second, it can be used to unwind positions before U.S. trading begins, but at prices pegged to the previous session's Big Board close.
In addition to the extra privacy of these trades, the transactions can often be less expensive to execute, because the parties don't have to pay a floor brokerage fee or a specialist's fee.
Still, "Much less {index-arbitrage activity} is done over here than in the U.S." said Richard Barfield, chief investment manager at Standard Life Assurance Co., which manages about # 15 billion ($23.72 billion) in United Kingdom institutional funds.
Britain has two main index-arbitrage instruments.
A Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index option contract is traded on the London Stock Exchange's Traded Options Market.
And an FT-SE futures contract is traded on the London International Financial Futures Exchange.
Both contracts have gained a following since the 1987 global market crash.
The average number of FT-SE option contracts traded on the London exchange has surged nearly tenfold since the contract's launch in 1984.
This year, the average of daily contracts traded totaled 9,118, up from 4,645 a year earlier and from 917 in 1984.
But a survey early this summer indicated that the volume of index-options trading was only 15% of the size of the underlying equity market, exchange officials said.
This compares with estimates that the U.S. "derivatives" market is perhaps four times as large as the underlying domestic market.
The House voted to boost the federal minimum wage for the first time since early 1981, casting a solid 382-37 vote for a compromise measure backed by President Bush.
The vote came after a debate replete with complaints from both proponents and critics of a substantial increase in the wage floor.
Advocates said the 90-cent-an-hour rise, to $4.25 an hour by April 1991, is too small for the working poor, while opponents argued that the increase will still hurt small business and cost many thousands of jobs.
But the legislation reflected a compromise agreed to on Tuesday by President Bush and Democratic leaders in Congress, after congressional Republicans urged the White House to bend a bit from its previous resistance to compromise.
So both sides accepted the compromise, which would lead to the first lifting of the minimum wage since a four-year law was enacted in 1977, raising the wage to $3.35 an hour from $2.65.
Under the measure passed yesterday, the minimum wage would rise to $3.80 next April.
The Senate plans to take up the measure quickly and is expected to pass it.
"There are no smiles about this bill," Rep. Pat Williams (D., Mont.) said during House floor debate yesterday.
But "because it's all we've got, I'm going to vote for it."
While the minimum wage had traditionally been pegged at half the average U.S. manufacturing wage, the level of $4.25 an hour in 1991 will still be less than 35% of average factory pay, Mr. Williams said.
But Rep. Marge Roukema (R., N.J.) instead praised the House's acceptance of a new youth "training" wage, a subminimum that GOP administrations have sought for many years.
Adopting a training-wage policy means "getting beyond the nickel and diming of the minimum wage," Mrs. Roukema said.
Policy makers regard the youth wage as helping to limit the loss of jobs from an increase in the minimum wage, but they have lately touted it as necessary to help impart job skills to entrants into the work force.
Labor unions and Democrats long fought the idea, but recently acceded to it in the face of Bush administration insistence.
The compromise sets the training wage at $3.35 an hour next April, and at $3.61 an hour, or 85% of the minimum wage, in April 1991.
Employers can pay the subminimum for 90 days, without restriction, to workers with less than six months of job experience, and for another 90 days if the company uses a government-certified training program for the young workers.
The training wage covers only workers who are 16 to 19 years old.
The White House previously insisted on an unrestricted six-month training wage that could be paid any time a worker of any age took a new job.
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, still opposed to any mininum-wage increase, said the compromise plan to lift the wage floor 27% in two stages between April 1990 and April 1991 "will be impossible for many employers to accommodate and will result in the elimination of jobs for American workers and higher prices for American consumers.
Zenith Data Systems Corp., a subsidiary of Zenith Electronics Corp., received a $534 million Navy contract for software and services of microcomputers over an 84-month period.
Rockwell International Corp. won a $130.7 million Air Force contract for AC-130U gunship replacement aircraft.
Martin Marietta Corp. was given a $29.9 million Air Force contract for low-altitude navigation and targeting equipment.
Federal Data Corp. got a $29.4 million Air Force contract for intelligence data handling.
For six years, T. Marshall Hahn Jr. has made corporate acquisitions in the George Bush mode: kind and gentle.
The question now: Can he act more like hard-charging Teddy Roosevelt?
Mr. Hahn, the 62-year-old chairman and chief executive officer of Georgia-Pacific Corp. is leading the forest-product concern's unsolicited $3.19 billion bid for Great Northern Nekoosa Corp.
Nekoosa has given the offer a public cold shoulder, a reaction Mr. Hahn hasn't faced in his 18 earlier acquisitions, all of which were negotiated behind the scenes.
So far, Mr. Hahn is trying to entice Nekoosa into negotiating a friendly surrender while talking tough.
"We are prepared to pursue aggressively completion of this transaction," he says.
But a takeover battle opens up the possibility of a bidding war, with all that implies.
If a competitor enters the game, for example, Mr. Hahn could face the dilemma of paying a premium for Nekoosa or seeing the company fall into the arms of a rival.
Given that choice, associates of Mr. Hahn and industry observers say the former university president -- who has developed a reputation for not overpaying for anything -- would fold.
"There's a price above which I'm positive Marshall has the courage not to pay," says A.D. Correll, Georgia-Pacific's executive vice president for pulp and paper.
Says long-time associate Jerry Griffin, vice president, corporate development, at WTD Industries Inc.: "He isn't of the old school of winning at any cost."
He also is a consensus manager, insiders say.
The decision to make the bid for Nekoosa, for example, was made only after all six members of Georgia-Pacific's management committee signed onto the deal -- even though Mr. Hahn knew he wanted to go after the company early on, says Mr. Correll.
Associates say Mr. Hahn picked up that careful approach to management as president of Virginia Polytechnic Institute.
Assuming that post at the age of 35, he managed by consensus, as is the rule in universities, says Warren H. Strother, a university official who is researching a book on Mr. Hahn.
But he also showed a willingness to take a strong stand.
In 1970, Mr. Hahn called in state police to arrest student protesters who were occupying a university building.
That impressed Robert B. Pamplin, Georgia-Pacific's chief executive at the time, whom Mr. Hahn had met while fundraising for the institute.
In 1975, Mr. Pamplin enticed Mr. Hahn into joining the company as executive vice president in charge of chemicals; the move befuddled many in Georgia-Pacific who didn't believe a university administrator could make the transition to the corporate world.
But Mr. Hahn rose swiftly through the ranks, demonstrating a raw intelligence that he says he knew he possessed early on.
The son of a physicist, Mr. Hahn skipped first grade because his reading ability was so far above his classmates.
Moving rapidly through school, he graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Kentucky at age 18, after spending only 2 1/2 years in college.
He earned his doctorate in nuclear physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Mr. Hahn agrees that he has a "retentive" memory, but friends say that's an understatement.
They call it "photographic".
Mr. Hahn also has engineered a surprising turnaround of Georgia-Pacific.
Taking over as chief executive officer in 1983, he inherited a company that was mired in debt and hurt by a recession-inspired slide in its building-products business.
Mr. Hahn began selling non-core businesses, such as oil and gas and chemicals.
He even sold one unit that made vinyl checkbook covers.
At the same time, he began building up the pulp and paper segment of the company while refocusing building products on home repair and remodeling, rather than materials for new-home construction.
The idea was to buffet building products from cycles in new-home construction.
The formula has paid off, so far.
Georgia-Pacific's sales climbed to $9.5 billion last year, compared with $6 billion in 1983, when Mr. Hahn took the reins.
Profit from continuing operations has soared to $467 million from $75 million.
Mr. Hahn attributes the gains to the philosophy of concentrating on what a company knows best.
"The record of companies that have diversified isn't all that impressive," he says.
Nekoosa wouldn't be a diversification.
It would be a good match, Mr. Hahn and many analysts say, of two healthy companies with high-quality assets and strong cash flows.
The resulting company would be the largest forest-products concern in the world with combined sales of more than $13 billion.
But can Mr. Hahn carry it off?
In this instance, industry observers say, he is entering uncharted waters.
Says Kathryn McAuley, an analyst at First Manhattan Co.: "This is the greatest acquisition challenge he has faced.
A House-Senate conference approved major portions of a package for more than $500 million in economic aid for Poland that relies heavily on $240 million in credit and loan guarantees in fiscal 1990 in hopes of stimulating future trade and investment.
For the Agency for International Development, appropriators approved $200 million in secondary loan guarantees under an expanded trade credit insurance program, and total loan guarantees for the Overseas Private Investment Corp. are increased by $40 million over fiscal 1989 as part of the same Poland package.
The conference approved at least $55 million in direct cash and development assistance as well, and though no decision was made, both sides are committed to adding more than $200 million in economic support funds and environmental initiatives sought by the Bush administration.
The agreement on Poland contrasts with the major differences remaining over the underlying foreign aid bill, which has already provoked veto threats by the White House and is sharply confined under this year's budget.
These fiscal pressures are also a factor in shaping the Poland package, and while more ambitious authorizing legislation is still pending, the appropriations bill in conference will be more decisive on U.S. aid to Eastern Europe.
To accommodate the additional cash assistance, the House Appropriations Committee last week was required to reallocate an estimated $140 million from the Pentagon.
And though the size of the loan guarantees approved yesterday is significant, recent experience with a similar program in Central America indicates that it could take several years before the new Polish government can fully use the aid effectively.
The action on Poland came as the conference separately approved $220 million for international population planning activities, an 11% increase over fiscal 1989.
The House and Senate are divided over whether the United Nations Population Fund will receive any portion of these appropriations, but the size of the increase is itself significant.
In a second area of common concern, the world environment, an additional $15 million will be provided in development assistance to fund a series of initiatives, related both to global warming and the plight of the African elephant.
The sweeping nature of the bill draws a variety of special interest amendments, running from an import exemption for a California airplane museum to a small but intriguing struggle among sugar producing nations over the fate of Panama's quota of exports to the profitable U.S. market.
Panama was stripped of this right because of U.S. differences with the Noriega regime, but the Central American country would have received a quota of 30,537 metric tons over a 21-month period ending Sept. 30, 1990.
About a quarter of this share has already been reallocated, according to the industry, but the remaining 23,403 tons are still a lucrative target for growers because the current U.S. price of 18 cents a pound runs as much as a nickel a pound above the world rate.
The potential sales are nearly $9.3 million, and House Majority Whip William Gray (D., Pa.) began the bidding this year by proposing language that the quota be allocated to English-speaking countries of the Caribbean, such as Jamaica and Barbados.
Rep. Jerry Lewis, a conservative Californian, added a provision of his own intended to assist Bolivia, and the Senate then broadened the list further by including all countries in the U.S. Caribbean Basin initiate as well as the Philippines-backed by the powerful Hawaii Democrat Sen. Daniel Inouye.
Jamaica, wary of upsetting its Caribbean Basin allies, has apparently instructed its lobbyist to abandon the provision initially drafted by Mr. Gray, but the greater question is whether Mr. Inouye, who has strong ties to the sugar industry, is able to insert a claim by the Philippines.
In separate floor action, the House waived budget restrictions and gave quick approval to $3.18 billion in supplemental appropriations for law enforcement and anti-drug programs in fiscal 1990.
The funding is attached to an estimated $27.1 billion transportation bill that goes next to the Senate and carries with it a proposed permanent smoking ban on virtually all U.S. domestic airline flights.
The leadership hopes to move the compromise measure promptly to the White House, but in recent days, the Senate has been as likely to bounce bills back to the House.
The most recent example was a nearly $17.3 billion fiscal 1990 bill funding the State, Justice and Commerce departments.
And after losing a battle Tuesday night with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, appropriators from both houses are expected to be forced back to conference.
EVERYONE AGREES that most of the nation's old bridges need to be repaired or replaced.
But there's disagreement over how to do it.
Highway officials insist the ornamental railings on older bridges aren't strong enough to prevent vehicles from crashing through.
But other people don't want to lose the bridges' beautiful, sometimes historic, features.
"The primary purpose of a railing is to contain a vehicle and not to provide a scenic view," says Jack White, a planner with the Indiana Highway Department.
He and others prefer to install railings such as the "type F safety shape," a four-foot-high concrete slab with no openings.
In Richmond, Ind., the type F railing is being used to replace arched openings on the G Street Bridge.
Garret Boone, who teaches art at Earlham College, calls the new structure "just an ugly bridge" and one that blocks the view of a new park below.
In Hartford, Conn., the Charter Oak Bridge will soon be replaced, the cast-iron medallions from its railings relegated to a park.
Compromises are possible.
Citizens in Peninsula, Ohio, upset over changes to a bridge, negotiated a deal: The bottom half of the railing will be type F, while the top half will have the old bridge's floral pattern.
Similarly, highway engineers agreed to keep the old railings on the Key Bridge in Washington, D.C., as long as they could install a crash barrier between the sidewalk and the road.
Tray Bon?
PORTING POTABLES just got easier, or so claims Scypher Corp., the maker of the Cup-Tote.
The Chicago company's beverage carrier, meant to replace cardboard trays at concession stands and fast-food outlets, resembles the plastic loops used on six-packs of beer, only the loops hang from a web of strings.
The new carrier can tote as many as four cups at once.
Inventor Claire Marvin says his design virtually eliminates spilling.
Lids aren't even needed.
He also claims the carrier costs less and takes up less space than most paper carriers.
A few fast-food outlets are giving it a try.
The company acknowledges some problems.
A driver has to find something to hang the carrier on, so the company supplies a window hook.
While it breaks down in prolonged sunlight, it isn't recyclable.
And unlike some trays, there's no place for food.
AN EXCHANGE of U.S. and Soviet designers promises change on both sides.
An exhibition of American design and architecture opened in September in Moscow and will travel to eight other Soviet cities.
The show runs the gamut, from a blender to chairs to a model of the Citicorp building.
The event continues into next year and includes an exchange program to swap design teachers at Carnegie-Mellon and Leningrad's Mutchin Institute.
Dan Droz, leader of the Carnegie-Mellon group, sees benefits all around.
The Soviets, who normally have few clients other than the state, will get "exposure to a market system," he says.
Americans will learn more about making products for the Soviets.
Mr. Droz says the Soviets could even help U.S. designers renew their sense of purpose.
"In Moscow, they kept asking us things like, `Why do you make 15 different corkscrews, when all you need is one good one?' '' he says.
"They got us thinking maybe we should be helping U.S. companies improve existing products rather than always developing new ones."
IT'S A TWO BIRDS with one stone deal: Eggers Group architects propose using grain elevators to house prisoners.
It would ease jail overcrowding while preserving historic structures, the company says.
But New York state, which is seeking solutions to its prison cell shortage, says "no."
Grain elevators built in the 1920s and '30s have six-inch concrete walls and a tubular shape that would easily contain semicircular cells with a control point in the middle, the New York firm says.
Many are far enough from residential areas to pass public muster, yet close enough to permit family visits.
Besides, Eggers says, grain elevators are worth preserving for aesthetic reasons -- one famed architect compared them to the pyramids of Egypt.
A number of cities -- including Minneapolis, Philadelphia and Houston -- have vacant grain elevators, Eggers says.
A medium-sized one in Brooklyn, it says, could be altered to house up to 1,000 inmates at a lower cost than building a new prison in upstate New York.
A spokesman for the state, however, calls the idea "not effective or cost efficient.
The Labor Department cited USX Corp. for numerous health and safety violations at two Pennsylvania plants, and proposed $7.3 million in fines, the largest penalty ever proposed for alleged workplace violations by an employer.
The department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration proposed fines of $6.1 million for alleged violations at the company's Fairless Hills, Pa., steel mill; that was a record for proposed penalties at any single facility.
OSHA cited nearly 1,500 alleged violations of federal electrical, crane-safety, record-keeping and other requirements.
A second citation covering the company's Clairton, Pa., coke works involved more than 200 alleged violations of electrical-safety and other requirements, for which OSHA proposed $1.2 million in fines.
Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole said, "The magnitude of these penalties and citations is matched only by the magnitude of the hazards to workers which resulted from corporate indifference to worker safety and health, and severe cutbacks in the maintenance and repair programs needed to remove those hazards."
OSHA said there have been three worker fatalities at the two plants in the past two years and 17 deaths since 1972.
Gerard Scannell, the head of OSHA, said USX managers have known about many of the safety and health deficiencies at the plants for years, "yet have failed to take necessary action to counteract the hazards."
"Particularly flagrant," Mrs. Dole said, "are the company's numerous failures to properly record injuries at its Fairless works, in spite of the firm promise it had made in an earlier corporate-wide settlement agreement to correct such discrepancies."
That settlement was in April 1987.
A USX spokesman said the company hadn't yet received any documents from OSHA regarding the penalty or fine.
"Once we do, they will receive very serious evaluation," the spokesman said.
"No consideration is more important than the health and safety of our employees."
USX said it has been cooperating with OSHA since the agency began investigating the Clairton and Fairless works.
He said that, if and when safety problems were identified, they were corrected.
The USX citations represented the first sizable enforcement action taken by OSHA under Mr. Scannell.
He has promised stiffer fines, though the size of penalties sought by OSHA have been rising in recent years even before he took office this year.
"The big problem is that USX management has proved unwilling to devote the necessary resources and manpower to removing hazards and to safeguarding safety and health in the plants," said Linda Anku, OSHA regional administrator in Philadelphia.
USX has 15 working days to contest the citations and proposed penalties, before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.
Before the USX case, OSHA's largest proposed fine for one employer was $4.3 million for alleged safety violations at John Morrell & Co., a meatpacking subsidiary of United Brands Co., Cincinnati.
The company is contesting the fine.
Due to an editing error, a letter to the editor in yesterday's edition from Frederick H. Hallett mistakenly identified the NRDC.
It should be the Natural Resources Defense Council.
Your Oct. 6 editorial "The Ill Homeless" referred to research by us and six of our colleagues that was reported in the Sept. 8 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association.
Your comments implied we had discovered that the "principal cause" of homelessness is to be found in the large numbers of mentally ill and substance-abusing people in the homeless population.
We have made no such statement.
It is clear that most mentally ill people and most alcoholics do not become homeless.
The "causes" of homelessness are poorly understood and complex in any individual case.
In quoting from our research you emphasized the high prevalance of mental illness and alcoholism.
You did not note that the homeless people we examined had a multitude of physical disorders in addition to their psychiatric problems and substance abuse.
They suffered from malnutrition, chest diseases, cardiovascular disorders, skin problems, infectious diseases and the aftereffects of assaults and rape.
Homeless people not only lack safety, privacy and shelter, they also lack the elementary necessities of nutrition, cleanliness and basic health care.
In a recent report, the Institute of Medicine pointed out that certain health problems may predispose a person to homelessness, others may be a consequence of it, and a third category is composed of disorders whose treatment is difficult or impossible if a person lacks adequate shelter.
The interactions between health and homelessness are complex, defying sweeping generalizations as to "cause" or "effect."
If we look to the future, preventing homelessness is an important objective.
This will require us to develop a much more sophisticated understanding of the dynamics of homelessness than we currently possess, an understanding that can be developed only through careful study and research.
A study by Tulane Prof. James Wright says homelessness is due to a complex array of problems, with the common thread of poverty.
The study shows that nearly 40% of the homeless population is made up of women and children and that only 25% of the homeless exhibits some combination of drug, alcohol and mental problems.
According to Dr. Wright, homelessness is "simultaneously a housing problem, an employment problem, a demographic problem, a problem of social disaffiliation, a mental health problem, a family violence problem, a problem created by the cutbacks in social welfare spending, a problem resulting from the decay of the traditional nuclear family, and a problem intimately connected to the recent increase in the number of persons living below the poverty level."
Leighton E. Cluff M.D. President Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Princeton, N.J.
To quote the highly regarded director of a privately funded drop-in center for the homeless in New York: "If you're homeless, you don't sleep for fear of being robbed or murdered.
After your first three weeks of sleep deprivation, you're scarcely in touch with reality any more; without psychiatric treatment, you may well be unable to fend for yourself ever again."
Some of the homeless, obviously, had pre-existing mental illness or addiction.
But many others have fallen through cracks in the economy into the grim, brutal world of our city streets.
Once there, what ways of escape are open to them other than drink, drugs or insanity?
Maxwell R.D. Vos Brooklyn, N.Y.
You dismiss as "sentimental" the view that the reduction of federal housing-assistance programs by 77% might have played a significant role in the increased number of men and women sleeping on our city streets during the Reagan-Bush years.
There is no sign that you bothered to consider the inverse of your logic: namely, that mental illness and substance abuse might be to some degree consequences rather than causes of homelessness.
Your research stopped when a convenient assertion could be made.
Robert S. Jenkins Cambridge, Mass.
Of the approximately 200 sponsors of the recent march in Washington for the homeless, you chose to cite such groups as the National Association of Home Builders and the International Union of Bricklayers and Allied Craftsmen, insinuating that the march got its major support from self-serving groups that "know a good thing when they see it," and that the crusade was based on greed or the profit motive.
But isn't the desire for profit the driving force behind those who subscribe to, and advertise in, your paper?
Why didn't you mention the YMCA or the YWCA or Catholic Charities USA or a hundred other nonprofit organizations that participated in the march?
As for the findings on the 203 Baltimore homeless who underwent psychiatric examinations, I suggest you conduct your own survey.
Choose 203 business executives, including, perhaps, someone from your own staff, and put them out on the streets, to be deprived for one month of their homes, families and income.
I would predict that within a short time most of them would find Thunderbird a satisfactory substitute for Chivas Regal and that their "normal" phobias, anxieties, depressions and substance abuse would increase dramatically.

ROGERS COMMUNICATIONS Inc. said it plans to raise 175 million to 180 million Canadian dollars (US$ 148.9 million to $153.3 million) through a private placement of perpetual preferred shares.
Perpetual preferred shares aren't retractable by the holders, the company said.
Rogers said the shares will be convertible into Class B shares, but that the company has the option to redeem the shares before a conversion takes place.
A spokesman for the Toronto cable television and telecommunications concern said the coupon rate hasn't yet been fixed, but will probably be set at around 8%.

The House passed legislation designed to make it easier for the Transportation Department to block airline leveraged buy-outs.
The final vote came after the House rejected Republican efforts to weaken the bill and approved two amendments sought by organized labor.
The Bush administration has threatened to veto such a bill because of what it views as an undesirable intrusion into the affairs of industry, but the 300-113 vote suggests that supporters have the potential to override a veto.
The broader question is where the Senate stands on the issue.
While the Senate Commerce Committee has approved legislation similar to the House bill on airline leveraged buy-outs, the measure hasn't yet come to the full floor.
Although the legislation would apply to acquisitions involving any major airline, it is aimed at giving the Transportation Department the chance to review in advance transactions financed by large amounts of debt.
"The purpose of the bill is to put the brakes on airline acquisitions that would so load a carrier up with debt that it would impede safety or a carrier's ability to compete," Rep. John Paul Hammerschmidt, (R., Ark.) said.
The bill, as it was approved by the House Public Works and Transportation Committee, would give the Transportation Department up to 50 days to review any purchase of 15% or more of the stock in an airline.
The department would be required to block the buy-out if the acquisition is likely to financially weaken a carrier so that safety would be impaired; its ability to compete would be sharply diminished; it would be put into foreign control; or if the transaction would result in the sale of airline-related assets -- unless selling such assets had an overriding public benefit.
The House approved an amendment offered by Rep. Peter DeFazio (D., Ore.) that would, in addition to the previous criteria, also require the department to block the acquisition of an airline if the added debt incurred were likely to result in a reduction in the number of the carrier's employees, or their wages or benefits.
Rep. James Traficant (D., Ohio), said the amendment, which passed 271-147, would "let the American worker know that we consider them occasionally."
But Rep. Hammerschmidt said that the provision, which he dubbed a "special interest" amendment, was likely to make the bill even more controversial.
On Tuesday, the House approved a labor-backed amendment that would require the Transportation Department to reject airline acquisitions if the person seeking to purchase a carrier had run two or more airlines previously that have filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code.
The provision, called the "two-time-losers" amendment by its supporters, apparently was aimed at preventing Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo from attempting to take over another airline.
You now may drop by the Voice of America offices in Washington and read the text of what the Voice is broadcasting to those 130 million people around the world who tune in to it each week.
You can even take notes -- extensive notes, for the Voice folks won't look over your shoulder -- about what you read.
You can do all this even if you're not a reporter or a researcher or a scholar or a member of Congress.
And my newspaper can print the text of those broadcasts.
Until the other day, you as an ordinary citizen of this democracy had no right to see what your government was telling your cousins around the world.
That was the law.
And I apparently had no right to print hither what the Voice was booming to yon.
It was censorship.
It was outrageous.
And it was stupid.
The theory was that the Voice is a propaganda agency and this government shouldn't propagandize its own people.
That sounds neat, but this government -- any government -- propagandizes its own people every day.
Government press releases, speeches, briefings, tours of military facilities, publications are all propaganda of sorts.
Propaganda is just information to support a viewpoint, and the beauty of a democracy is that it enables you to hear or read every viewpoint and then make up your own mind on an issue.
The restrictions on viewing and dissemination of Voice material were especially absurd: An agency in the information business was not being allowed to inform.
In June 1988, I wrote in this space about this issue.
Assuming it wasn't one of those columns that you clipped and put on the refrigerator door, I'll review the facts.
The Voice of America is a government agency that broadcasts news and views -- some might say propaganda -- in 43 languages to 130 million listeners around the world.
It does a first-rate job.
Its budget $184 million -- is paid for by you.
But a 1948 law barred the "dissemination" of that material in the U.S..
The law let scholars, reporters and researchers read texts of VOA material, only at VOA headquarters in Washington, but it barred them from copying texts.
And, of course, there's that word "dissemination."
How's that again?
"You may come by the agency to read but not copy either manually or by photocopying," a Voice official explained when I asked.
What if I tune in my short-wave radio, transcribe an editorial or program, and print it in my newspaper?
"Nor are you free to reprint such material," I was advised.
That sounded a lot like censorship, so after years of letters and conversations that went nowhere, I sued.
A couple of weeks ago, I lost the case in federal district court in Des Moines.
At least, that's the way it was reported.
And, indeed, the lawsuit was dismissed.
But I -- I like to think of it in terms of we, all of us -- won the point.
For a funny thing happened on the way to the ruling: The United States Information Agency, which runs the Voice, changed its position on three key points.
-- The USIA said that, on reflection, of course I could print anything I could get my hands on.
The word dissemination, it decided, referred only to itself.
"The USIA officially and publicly declared the absolute right of everyone except the USIA to disseminate agency program materials in the United States," my lawyer, the scholarly Mark McCormick of Des Moines, said in a memo pointing out the facts and trying to make me feel good after the press reported that I had lost.
The court noted the new USIA position but, just in case, officially found "that Congress did not intend to preclude plaintiffs from disseminating USIA information domestically."
-- The USIA said that, on reflection, anyone could view the VOA materials, not just the reporters, scholars, researchers and congressmen who are mentioned in the statute.
"The USIA publicly and officially stated in the litigation that all persons are allowed access to the materials, notwithstanding the statutory designations, because the USIA has determined that it will not check the credentials of any person appearing and requesting to see the materials," Mr. McCormick noted.
-- And the USIA said that all of us could take extensive notes.
"The agency publicly and officially declared in the lawsuit that persons who examine the materials may make notes and, while the agency position is that persons may not take verbatim notes, no one will check to determine what notes a person has taken," Mr. McCormick reported.
I had sought, in my suit, the right to print Voice material, which had been denied me, and I had sought a right to receive the information, arguing in effect that a right to print government information isn't very helpful if I have no right to get the information.
But the court disagreed.
"The First Amendment proscribes the government from passing laws abridging the right to free speech," Judge Donald O'Brien ruled.
"The First Amendment does not prescribe a duty upon the government to assure easy access to information for members of the press."
You have a right to read Voice of America scripts if you don't mind traveling to Washington every week or so and visiting the Voice office during business hours.
I have a right to print those scripts if I go there and laboriously -- but no longer surreptitiously -- copy them out in long hand.
But neither of us can copy the material on a Xerox machine or have it sent to us.
In an era when every government agency has a public-relations machine that sends you stuff whether you want it or not, this does seem odd.
Indeed, Judge O'Brien ruled that "it would be easy to conclude that the USIA's position is `inappropriate or even stupid,' '' but it's the law.
So the next step, I suspect, is to try to get the law changed.
We (I assume you're in this with me at this point) need to get three words -- "for examination only" -- eliminated from the law.
Section 501 of the United States Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948 says Voice material shall be available to certain of us (but now, thanks to the USIA's new position, all of us) "for examination only."
If those words weren't there, the nice people at the Voice would be able to send you the information or, at the very least, let you photocopy it.
This is not a trivial issue.
"You have... raised important questions which ought to be answered: What does USIA say about America abroad; how do we say it; and how can American taxpayers get the answers to these questions?" a man wrote me a couple of years ago.
The man was Charles Z. Wick.
He had no answers then.
Now there are some.
This democracy is suddenly a little more democratic.
I feel pretty good about it.
Mr. Gartner is editor and co-owner of the Daily Tribune in Ames, Iowa, and president of NBC News in New York.
R. Gordon McGovern was forced out as Campbell Soup Co.'s president and chief executive officer, the strongest evidence yet of the power that Dorrance family members intend to wield in reshaping the troubled food company.
Herbert M. Baum, the 53-year-old president of the company's Campbell U.S.A. unit, and Edwin L. Harper, 47, the chief financial officer, will run Campbell as a team, dividing responsibilities rather evenly until a successor is named.
The board already has been searching for strong outside candidates, including food-industry executives with considerable international experience.
Wall Street reacted favorably to Mr. McGovern's departure and its implications.
In heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Campbell's shares rose $3.375 to close at $47.125.
"The profit motive of the major shareholders has clearly changed for the better," said John McMillin, a food industry analyst for Prudential-Bache in New York.
Mr. McGovern was widely seen as sales, and not profit, oriented.
"New managers would think a little more like Wall Street," Mr. McMillin added.
Some of the surge in the stock's price appeared to be linked to revived takeover speculation, which has contributed to volatility of Campbell shares in recent months.
Campbell's international businesses, particularly in the U.K. and Italy, appear to be at the heart of its problems.
Growth has fallen short of targets and operating earnings are far below results in U.S. units.
For example, Campbell is a distant third in the U.K. frozen foods market, where it recently paid 24 times earnings for Freshbake Foods PLC and wound up with far more capacity than it could use.
Similarly, Campbell's Italian biscuit operation, D. Lazzaroni & Co., has been hurt by overproduction and distribution problems.
Such problems will require considerable skill to resolve.
However, neither Mr. Baum nor Mr. Harper has much international experience.
Mr. Baum, a seasoned marketer who is said to have a good rapport with Campbell employees, will have responsibility for all domestic operations except the Pepperidge Farm unit.
Mr. Harper, a veteran of several manufacturing companies who joined Campbell in 1986, will take charge of all overseas operations as well as Pepperidge.
In an joint interview yesterday, both men said they would like to be the company's next chief executive.
Mr. McGovern, 63, had been under intense pressure from the board to boost Campbell's mediocre performance to the level of other food companies.
The board is dominated by the heirs of the late John T. Dorrance Jr., who controlled about 58% of Campbell's stock when he died in April.
In recent months, Mr. Dorrance's children and other family members have pushed for improved profitability and higher returns on their equity.
In August, the company took a $343 million pretax charge against fiscal 1989 earnings when it announced a world-wide restructuring plan.
The plan calls for closing at least nine plants and eliminating about 3,600 jobs.
But analysts said early results from the reorganization have been disappointing, especially in Europe, and there were signs that the board became impatient.
Campbell officials said Mr. McGovern wasn't available yesterday to discuss the circumstances of his departure.
The company's prepared statement quoted him as saying, "The CEO succession is well along and I've decided for personal reasons to take early retirement."
But people familiar with the agenda of the board's meeting last week in London said Mr. McGovern was fired.
Mr. McGovern himself had said repeatedly that he intended to stay on until he reached the conventional retirement age of 65 in October 1991, "unless I get fired."
Campbell said Mr. McGovern had withdrawn his name as a candidate for re-election as a director at the annual shareholder meeting, scheduled for Nov. 17.
For fiscal 1989, Mr. McGovern received a salary of $877,663.
He owns about 45,000 shares of Campbell stock and has options to buy more than 100,000 additional shares.
He will be eligible for an annual pension of more than $244,000 with certain other fringe benefits.
During Mr. McGovern's nine-year term as president, the company's sales rose to $5.7 billion from $2.8 billion and net income increased to $274 million from $130 million, the statement said.
Mr. Baum said he and Mr. Harper both advocated closing some plants as long ago as early 1988.
"You've got to make the restructuring work," said Mr. Baum.
"You've got to make those savings now."
Mr. Harper expressed confidence that he and Mr. Baum can convince the board of their worthiness to run the company.
"We look upon this as a great opportunity to prove the fact that we have a tremendous management team," he said.
He predicted that the board would give the current duo until early next year before naming a new chief executive.
Mr. Baum said the two have orders to "focus on bottom-line profits" and to "take a hard look at our businesses -- what is good, what is not so good."
Analysts generally applaud the performance of Campbell U.S.A., the company's largest division, which posted 6% unit sales growth and a 15% improvement in operating profit for fiscal 1989.
"The way that we've been managing Campbell U.S.A. can hopefully spread to other areas of the company," Mr. Baum said.
In the interview at headquarters yesterday afternoon, both men exuded confidence and seemed to work well together.
"You've got two champions sitting right before you," said Mr. Baum.
"We play to win.

Robert L. Bernstein, chairman and president of Random House Inc., announced his resignation from the publishing house he has run for 23 years.
A successor wasn't named, which fueled speculation that Mr. Bernstein may have clashed with S.I. Newhouse Jr., whose family company, Advance Publications Inc., owns Random House.
Abrupt departures aren't unheard of within the Newhouse empire.
In an interview, Mr. Bernstein said his departure "evolved out of discussions with Si Newhouse and that's the decision I reached."
He declined to elaborate, other than to say, "It just seemed the right thing to do at this minute.
Sometimes you just go with your gut."
Mr. Bernstein said he will stay until Dec. 31 and work with his successor, who is to be named soon.
Mr. Newhouse, meanwhile, insisted that he isn't unhappy with Mr. Bernstein or the performance of Random House, the largest trade publishing house in the U.S..
The company said the publisher's annual sales volume increased to $800 million from $40 million during Mr. Bernstein's tenure.
"Bob has handled the extraordinary growth of the company quite brilliantly," said Mr. Newhouse.
"The company is doing well, it's stable, it's got good people.
Bob has an agenda and this seemed like the natural time."
Publishing officials believe that while Random House has enjoyed spectacular growth and has smoothly integrated many acquisitions in recent years, some of the bigger ones haven't been absorbed so easily.
Crown Publishing Group, acquired last year, is said to be turning in disappointing results.
As a private company, Random House doesn't report its earnings.
Mr. Bernstein, who succeeded Bennett Cerf, has been only the second president of Random House since it was founded in 1925.
Speculation on his successor centers on a number of division heads at the house.
Possible candidates include Susan Petersen, president of Ballantine/Del Rey/Fawcett, Random House's huge and successful paperback division.
Some say Anthony Cheetham, head of a recently acquired British company, Century Hutchinson, could be chosen.
There is also speculation that Mr. Newhouse could bring in a powerhouse businessman or another Newhouse family member to run the business side, in combination with a publishing executive like Robert Gottlieb, who left Random House's Alfred A. Knopf to run the New Yorker, also owned by the Newhouse family.
Not included on the most-likely-successor list are Joni Evans, recruited two years ago to be publisher of adult trade books for Random House, and Sonny Mehta, president of the prestigious Alfred A. Knopf unit.
When Ms. Evans took her job, several important divisions that had reported to her predecessor weren't included partly because she didn't wish to be a full-time administrator.
Mr. Mehta is widely viewed as a brilliant editor but a less-than-brilliant administrator and his own departure was rumored recently.
Mr. Bernstein, a tall, energetic man who is widely respected as a publishing executive, has spent much of his time in recent years on human rights issues.
Congress learned during the Reagan administration that it could intimidate the executive branch by uttering again and again the same seven words: "Provided, that no funds shall be spent...."
This phrase once again is found throughout the many appropriations bills now moving through Congress.
It signals Congress's attempt, under the pretext of guarding the public purse, to deny the president the funding necessary to execute certain of his duties and prerogatives specified in Article II of the Constitution.
This species of congressional action is predicated on an interpretation of the appropriations clause that is erroneous and unconstitutional.
The appropriations clause states that "No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law...."
The prevailing interpretation of the clause on Capitol Hill is that it gives Congress an omnipresent veto over every conceivable action of the president through the ability to withhold funding.
This interpretation was officially endorsed by Congress in 1987 in the Iran-Contra Report.
As partisans of congressional power understand, a "power of the purse" so broadly construed would emasculate the presidency and swallow the principle of separation of powers.
It is not supported by the text or history of the Constitution.
The framers hardly discussed the appropriations clause at the Constitutional Convention of 1787, according to Madison's notes.
To the extent they did, their concern was to ensure fiscal accountability.
Moreover, the framers believed that the nation needed a unitary executive with the independence and resources to perform the executive functions that the Confederation Congress had performed poorly under the Articles of Confederation.
It would contradict that objective if the appropriations clause (technically a limitation on legislative power) could be read as placing the president on Congress's short leash, making the executive consist of the president and every member of Congress.
As it went to the conference panel now deliberating, the appropriations bill for the executive office of the president for fiscal 1990 contained some breathtaking attempts by Congress to rewrite the Constitution under the pretext of protecting the public's money.
During the coming weeks, President Bush must decide whether to veto the bills containing them -- or, alternatively, to sign these bills into law with a statement declaring their intrusions on executive power to be in violation of Article II, and thus void and severable.
The 1990 appropriations legislation attempts to strip the president of his powers to make certain appointments as provided by Article II.
Article II places on the president the duty to nominate, "and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate" appoint, ambassadors, judges, and other officers of the U.S..
It also empowers the president to make recess appointments, without Senate approval: "The President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session."
Yet Section 605 of the appropriations bill for the executive office provides: "No part of any appropriation for the current fiscal year contained in this or any other Act shall be paid to any person for the filling of any position for which he or she has been nominated after the Senate has voted not to approve the nomination of said person."
Thus, with one brief passage in an appropriations bill, Congress repeals the president's power to make recess appointments under Article II.
Section 605 also imposes unconstitutional conditions on the president's ability to nominate candidates of his choosing.
The language of the appropriations rider implies that any nomination to any position of a rejected nominee will result in the president being denied funding to pay that person's salary.
The president could probably not avoid this restriction by choosing people willing to serve without pay, because the Anti-Deficiency Act prohibits voluntary service to the government.
The 1990 appropriations bills also contain a number of "muzzling" provisions that violate the recommendation clause in Article II of the Constitution.
Muzzling provisions, which might be called "blindfold laws" as well, prevent the executive branch from even looking at certain policy options, let alone from recommending them to Congress.
Such laws violate the provision in Article II that requires the president to make recommendations to Congress, but which gives the president the discretion to select the subject matter of those recommendations.
Typically, these laws seek to prevent executive branch officials from inquiring into whether certain federal programs make any economic sense or proposing more market-oriented alternatives to regulations.
Probably the most egregious example is a proviso in the appropriations bill for the executive office that prevents the president's Office of Management and Budget from subjecting agricultural marketing orders to any cost-benefit scrutiny.
There is something inherently suspect about Congress's prohibiting the executive from even studying whether public funds are being wasted in some favored program or other.
Perhaps none of the unconstitutional conditions contained in the appropriations bills for fiscal 1990 better illustrates Congress's attempt to usurp executive power than Section 609 of the executive-office bill: "None of the funds made available pursuant to the provisions of this Act shall be used to implement, administer, or enforce any regulation which has been disapproved pursuant to a resolution of disapproval duly adopted in accordance with the applicable law of the United States."
This provision amounts to a legislative veto over the president's execution of the law, since a one-house resolution could be said to be "duly adopted" even though it would require neither bicameral action in Congress nor presentation to the president for his signature or veto.
The Supreme Court's decision in INS v. Chadha held that legislative vetoes are unconstitutional.
President Bush should veto appropriations acts that contain these kinds of unconstitutional conditions on the president's ability to discharge his duties and exercise his prerogatives.
If President Bush fails to do so in his first year, he will invite Congress, for the remainder of his presidency, to rewrite Article II of the Constitution to suit its purposes.
What becomes custom in the Bush administration will only become more difficult for future presidents, including Democrats, to undo.
President Reagan learned that lesson.
By 1987, then-Speaker Jim Wright was discussing arms control in Moscow with Mikhail Gorbachev and then attempting to direct the president, through an appropriations rider, to treat the Soviets as though the Senate had ratified SALT II.
If a veto is unworkable because it would leave part of the executive branch unfunded, the president could sign the appropriations bills into law and assert a power of excision, declaring the rider restricting his Article II powers to be unconstitutional and severable.
The Constitution does not expressly give the president such power.
However, the president does have a duty not to violate the Constitution.
The question is whether his only means of defense is the veto.
Excision of appropriations riders that trespass on the president's duties and prerogative under Article II would be different from the line-item veto.
As discussed in the context of controlling federal spending, the line-item veto is characterized as a way for the president to excise perfectly constitutional provisions in a spending bill that are objectionable merely because they conflict with his policy objectives.
The excision of unconstitutional conditions in an appropriations bill would be a power of far more limited applicability.
One could argue that it is not an assertion of a item veto at all for the president, by exerting a power of excision, to resist unconstitutional conditions in legislation that violate the separation of powers.
There is no downside if the president asserts a right of excision over unconstitutional conditions in the fiscal 1990 appropriations bills.
If Congress does nothing, President Bush will have won.
If Congress takes the dispute to the Supreme Court (assuming it can establish standing to sue), President Bush might win.
In that case, he might receive an opinion from the court that is a vindication of the president's right to perform the duties and exercise the prerogatives the framers thought should be entrusted to the executive.
If President Bush loses at the court, it might be disappointing, as Morrison v. Olson was for the Reagan administration.
But the presidency would be no worse off than it is now.
Moreover, the electorate would have received a valuable civics lesson in how the separation of powers works in practice.
As it stands now, Congress presumes after the Reagan administration that the White House will take unconstitutional provisions in appropriations bills lying down.
President Bush should set things straight.
If he does not, he will help realize Madison's fear in The Federalist No. 48 of a legislature "everywhere extending the sphere of its activity and drawing all powers into its impetuous vortex."
Mr. Sidak served as an attorney in the Reagan administration.
His longer analysis of executive power and the appropriations clause is to appear in the Duke Law Journal later this year.
Despite one of the most devastating droughts on record, net cash income in the Farm Belt rose to a new high of $59.9 billion last year.
The previous record was $57.7 billion in 1987, according to the Agriculture Department.
Net cash income -- the amount left in farmers' pockets after deducting expenses from gross cash income -- increased in 33 states in 1988, as the drought cut into crop yields and drove up commodity prices, the department's Economic Research Service reported yesterday.
Most of those states set farm income records.
The worst crop damage occurred in the Midwestern Corn Belt and the northern Great Plains.
What saved many farmers from a bad year was the opportunity to reclaim large quantities of grain and other crops that they had "mortgaged" to the government under price-support loan programs.
With prices soaring, they were able to sell the reclaimed commodities at "considerable profit," the agency's 240-page report said.
In less parched areas, meanwhile, farmers who had little or no loss of production profited greatly from the higher prices.
To the surprise of some analysts, net cash income rose in some of the hardest-hit states, including Indiana, Illinois, Nebraska and the Dakotas.
Analysts attributed the increases partly to the $4 billion disaster-assistance package enacted by Congress.
Last year's record net cash income confirms the farm sector's rebound from the agricultural depression of the early 1980s.
It also helps explain the reluctance of the major farm lobbies and many lawmakers to make any significant changes in the 1985 farm program next year.
Commodity prices have been rising in recent years, with the farm price index hitting record peaks earlier this year, as the government curtailed production with land-idling programs to reduce price-depressing surpluses.
At the same time, export demand for U.S. wheat, corn and other commodities strengthened, said Keith Collins, a department analyst.
Farmers also benefited from strong livestock prices, as the nation's cattle inventory dropped close to a 30-year low.
"All of these forces came together in 1988 to benefit agriculture," Mr. Collins said.
California led the nation with $6.5 billion in net cash income last year, followed by Texas, $3.9 billion; Iowa, $3.4 billion; Florida, $3.1 billion; and Minnesota, $2.7 billion.
Iowa and Minnesota were among the few major farm states to log a decline in net cash income.
Despite federal disaster relief, the drought of 1988 was a severe financial setback for an estimated 10,000 to 15,000 farmers, according to the department.
Many lost their farms.
Department economists don't expect 1989 to be as good a year as 1988 was.
Indeed, net cash income is likely to fall this year as farm expenses rise and government payments to farmers decline.
At the same time, an increase of land under cultivation after the drought has boosted production of corn, soybeans and other commodities, causing a fall in prices that has been only partly cushioned by heavy grain buying by the Soviets.
Last year, government payments to farmers slipped to less than $14.5 billion from a record $16.7 billion in 1987.
Payments are expected to range between $9 billion and $12 billion this year.
After years of struggling, the Los Angeles Herald Examiner will publish its last edition today, shut down by its parent, Hearst Corp., following unsuccessful efforts to sell the venerable newspaper.
The demise of the 238,000-circulation Herald, once the nation's largest afternoon newspaper with circulation exceeding 700,000, turns the country's second-largest city into a one-newspaper town, at least in some senses.
The Los Angeles Times, with a circulation of more than 1.1 million, dominates the region.
But it faces stiff competition in Orange County from the Orange County Register, which sells more than 300,000 copies a day, and in the San Fernando Valley from the Los Angeles Daily News, which sells more than 170,000.
Nearby cities such as Pasadena and Long Beach also have large dailies.
In July, closely held Hearst, based in New York, put the paper on the block.
Speculation had it that the company was asking $100 million for an operation said to be losing about $20 million a year, but others said Hearst might have virtually given the paper away.
An attempted buy-out led by John J. McCabe, chief operating officer, never materialized, and a stream of what one staff member dismissed as "tire-kickers and lookee-loos" had filed through since.
The prospective buyers included investor Marvin Davis and the Toronto Sun.
The death of the Herald, a newsstand paper in a freeway town, was perhaps inevitable.
Los Angeles is a sprawling, balkanized newspaper market, and advertisers seemed to feel they could buy space in the mammoth Times, then target a particular area with one of the regional dailies.
The Herald was left in limbo.
Further, the Herald seemed torn editorially between keeping its old-time Hearst readership -- blue-collar and sports-oriented -- and trying to provide a sprightly, upscale alternative to the sometimes staid Times.
Hearst had flirted with a conversion to tabloid format for years but never executed the plan.
The Herald joins the Baltimore News-American, which folded, and the Boston Herald-American, which was sold, as cornerstones of the old Hearst newspaper empire abandoned by the company in the 1980s.
Many felt Hearst kept the paper alive as long as it did, if marginally, because of its place in family history.
Its fanciful offices were designed by architect Julia Morgan, who built the Hearst castle at San Simeon.
William Randolph Hearst had kept an apartment in the Spanish Renaissance-style building.
Analysts said the Herald's demise doesn't necessarily represent the overall condition of the newspaper industry.
"The Herald was a survivor from a bygone age," said J. Kendrick Noble, a media analyst with PaineWebber Inc.
"Actually, the long deterioration in daily newspapers shows signs of coming to an end, and the industry looks pretty healthy."
Founded as the Examiner in 1903 by Mr. Hearst, the Herald was crippled by a bitter, decade-long strike that began in 1967 and cut circulation in half.
Financially, it never recovered; editorially, it had its moments.
In 1979, Hearst hired editor James Bellows, who brightened the editorial product considerably.
He and his successor, Mary Anne Dolan, restored respect for the editorial product, and though in recent years the paper had been limping along on limited resources, its accomplishments were notable.
For example, the Herald consistently beat its much-larger rival on disclosures about Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley's financial dealings.
The Herald's sports coverage and arts criticism were also highly regarded.
Robert J. Danzig, vice president and general manager of Hearst Newspapers, stood up in the paper's newsroom yesterday and announced that no buyers had stepped forward and that the paper would fold, putting more than 730 full-time employees out of work.
Hearst said it would provide employees with a placement service and pay them for 60 days.
Some long-tenured employees will receive additional benefits, the company said.
Hours after the announcement, representatives of the Orange County Register were in a bar across the street recruiting.
The reaction in the newsroom was emotional.
"I've never seen so many people crying in one place at one time," said Bill Johnson, an assistant city editor.
"So Long, L.A." was chosen as the paper's final headline.
"I'm doing the main story, and I'm already two beers drunk," said reporter Andy Furillo, whom the Times hired away several years ago but who returned to the Herald out of preference.
His wife also works for the paper, as did his father.
Outside, a young pressman filling a news box with an extra edition headlined "Herald Examiner Closes" refused to take a reader's quarter.
"Forget it," he said as he handed her a paper.
"It doesn't make any difference now.
Olympia Broadcasting Corp. said it didn't make a $1.64 million semiannual interest payment due yesterday on $23.4 million of senior subordinated debentures.
The radio-station owner and programmer said it was trying to obtain additional working capital from its senior secured lenders and other financial institutions.
It said it needs to make the payment by Dec. 1 to avoid a default that could lead to an acceleration of the debt.
In September, the company said it was seeking offers for its five radio stations in order to concentrate on its programming business.
If you'd really rather have a Buick, don't leave home without the American Express card.
Or so the slogan might go.
American Express Co. and General Motors Corp.'s beleaguered Buick division are joining forces in a promotion aimed at boosting Buick's sales while encouraging broader use of the American Express card.
The companies are giving four-day vacations for two to Buick buyers who charge all or part of their down payments on the American Express green card.
They have begun sending letters explaining the program, which began Oct. 18 and will end Dec. 18, to about five million card holders.
Neither company would disclose the program's cost.
Buick approached American Express about a joint promotion because its card holders generally have a "good credit history" and are "good at making payments," says a spokeswoman for the division.
American Express also represents the upscale image "we're trying to project," she adds.
Buick has been seeking for the past few years to restore its reputation as "the doctor's car" -- a product for upscale professionals.
Sales were roughly flat in the 1989 model year compared with a year earlier, though industry sales fell.
But since the 1990 model year began Oct. 1, Buick sales have plunged 33%.
For American Express, the promotion is part of an effort to broaden the use of its card for retail sales, where the company expects to get much of the future growth in its card business.
Traditionally, the card has been used mainly for travel and entertainment expenses.
Phillip Riese, an American Express executive vice president, says the promotion with Buick is his company's first with an auto maker, but "hopefully {will be} the first of many" in the company's effort to promote its green card as "the total car-care card."
To that end, American Express has been signing up gasoline companies, car repair shops, tire companies and car dealers to accept the card.
Many auto dealers now let car buyers charge part or all of their purchase on the American Express card, but few card holders realize this, Mr. Riese says.
Until now, however, buyers who wanted to finance part of a car purchase through General Motors Acceptance Corp. couldn't put their down payment on a charge card because of possible conflicts with truth-in-lending and state disclosure laws over finance rates, says a spokesman for the GM finance arm.
But GMAC approved the Buick program, he says, because the American Express green card requires payment in full upon billing, and so doesn't carry any finance rates.
Mr. Riese says American Express considers GM and Buick "very sophisticated direct-mail marketers," so "by joining forces with them we have managed to maximize our direct-mail capability."
In addition, Buick is a relatively respected nameplate among American Express card holders, says an American Express spokeswoman.
When the company asked members in a mailing which cars they would like to get information about for possible future purchases, Buick came in fourth among U.S. cars and in the top 10 of all cars, the spokeswoman says.
American Express has more than 24 million card holders in the U.S., and over half have the green card.
GMAC screened the card-member list for holders more than 30 years old with household incomes over $45,000 who hadn't "missed any payments," the Buick spokeswoman says.
Some 3.8 million of the five million who will get letters were preapproved for credit with GMAC.
These 3.8 million people also are eligible to get one percentage point off GMAC's advertised finance rates, which start at 6.9% for two-year loan contracts.
A spokesman for Visa International's U.S. subsidiary says his company is using promotions to increase use of its cards, but doesn't have plans for a tie-in similar to the American Express-Buick link.
Three divisions at American Express are working with Buick on the promotion: the establishment services division, which is responsible for all merchants and companies that accept the card; the travel division; and the merchandise sales division.
The vacation packages include hotel accommodations and, in some cases, tours or tickets to local attractions, but not meals.
Destinations are Chicago; Honolulu; Las Vegas, Nev.; Los Angeles; Miami Beach, Fla.; New Orleans; New York; Orlando, Fla.; San Francisco; and Washington, D.C.
A buyer who chooses to fly to his destination must pay for his own ticket but gets a companion's ticket free if they fly on United Airlines.
In lieu of the vacation, buyers can choose among several prizes, including a grandfather clock or a stereo videocassette recorder.
Card holders who receive the letter also are eligible for a sweepstakes with Buick cars or a Hawaii vacation as prizes.
If they test-drive a Buick, they get an American Express calculator.
This isn't Buick's first travel-related promotion.
A few years ago, the company offered two round-trip tickets on Trans World Airlines to buyers of its Riviera luxury car.
The promotion helped Riviera sales exceed the division's forecast by more than 10%, Buick said at the time.
The United Kingdom High Court declared illegal a variety of interest-rate swap transactions and options deals between a London borough council and commercial banks.
The ruling could lead to the cancellation of huge bank debts the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham ran up after losing heavily on swap transactions.
As many as 70 U.K. and international banks stand to lose several hundred million pounds should the decision be upheld and set a precedent for other municipalities.
An appeal is expected.
In response to the ruling, gilt futures swiftly plunged more than a point yesterday before recovering much of the loss by the end of the session.
Gilts, or British government bonds, which also fell sharply initially, retraced some of the losses to end about 3/8 point lower.
The council, which is alleged to have engaged in over 600 deals valued at over # 6 billion ($9.5 billion), lost millions of pounds from soured swap deals.
At one point, Hammersmith is reported to have accounted for as much as 10% of the sterling market in interest-rate swap dealings.
When two parties engage in an interest-rate swap, they are betting against each other on future rates.
Thus, an institution obligated to make fixed-rate interest payments on debt swaps the payments with another making floating-rate payments.
In most of the British transactions, the municipalities agreed to make floating-rate payments to banks, which would make fixed-rate payments.
As interest rates rose, municipalities owed the banks more than the banks were paying them.
The court hearing began in early October at the request of Anthony Hazell, district auditor for Hammersmith, who argued that local councils aren't vested with constitutional authority to engage in such capital-markets activities.
The council backed the audit commission's stand that the swap transactions are illegal.
Although the Hammersmith and Fulham council was by far the most active local authority engaging in such capital-markets transactions, the court decision could set a precedent for similar transactions by 77 other local councils.
"While this court ruling was only on Hammersmith, it will obviously be very persuasive in other cases of a similar nature," a solicitor representing one of the banks said.
Already, 10 local councils have refused to honor fees and payments to banks incurred during various swaps dealings.
Other financial institutions involved include Barclays Bank PLC, Midland Bank PLC, Security Pacific Corp., Chemical Banking Corp.'s Chemical Bank, Citicorp's Citibank and Mitsubishi Finance International.
If the banks exhaust all avenues of appeal, it is possible that they would seek to have the illegality ruling work both ways, some market sources said.
Banks could seek to recover payments to local authorities in instances where the banks made net payments to councils.
Officials from the various banks involved are expected to meet during the next few days to consider other arrangements with local authorities that could be questionable.
The banks have 28 days to file an appeal against the ruling and are expected to do so shortly.
In the aftermath of the stock market's gut-wrenching 190-point drop on Oct. 13, Kidder, Peabody & Co.'s 1,400 stockbrokers across the country began a telephone and letter-writing campaign aimed at quashing the country's second-largest program trader.
The target of their wrath?
Their own employer, Kidder Peabody.
Since October's minicrash, Wall Street has been shaken by an explosion of resentment against program trading, the computer-driven, lightning-fast trades of huge baskets of stocks and futures that can send stock prices reeling in minutes.
But the heated fight over program trading is about much more than a volatile stock market.
The real battle is over who will control that market and reap its huge rewards.
Program trading itself, according to many academics who have studied it, is merely caught in the middle of this battle, unfairly labeled as the evil driving force of the marketplace.
The evidence indicates that program trading didn't, in fact, cause the market's sharp fall on Oct. 13, though it may have exacerbated it.
On one side of this power struggle stand the forces in ascendency on Wall Street -- the New Guard -- consisting of high-tech computer wizards at the major brokerage firms, their pension fund clients with immense pools of money, and the traders at the fast-growing Chicago futures exchanges.
These are the main proponents of program trading.
Defending their ramparts are Wall Street's Old Guard -- the traditional, stock-picking money managers, tens of thousands of stock brokers, the New York Stock Exchange's listed companies and the clannish floor traders, known as specialists, who make markets in their stocks.
So far, Wall Street's Old Guard seems to be winning the program-trading battle, successfully mobilizing public and congressional opinion to bludgeon their tormentors.
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, a major futures marketplace, yesterday announced the addition of another layer of trading halts designed to slow program traders during a rapidly falling stock market, and the Big Board is expected today to approve some additional restrictions on program trading.
Stung by charges that their greed is turning the stock market into a gigantic crapshoot, almost all the big investment banking houses have abandoned index arbitrage, a common form of program trading, for their own accounts in the past few days.
A few, such as giant Merrill Lynch & Co., now refuse even to do index arbitrage trades for clients.
The Old Guard's assault on program trading and its practitioners has been fierce and broad-based, in part because some Old Guard members feel their very livelihood is at stake.
Some, such as traditional money manager Neuberger & Berman, have taken out national newspaper advertisements demanding that market regulators "stop the numbers racket on Wall Street."
Big Board stock specialists, in a bold palace revolt, began shortly after Oct. 13 to telephone the corporate executives of the companies whose stock is listed on the Big Board to have them pressure the exchange to ban program trading.
Charles Wohlstetter, the chairman of Contel Corp. who is rallying other CEOs to the anti-program trading cause, says he has received "countless" letters offering support.
"They said universally, without a single exception: Don't even compromise.
Kill it," he says.
Wall Street's New Guard isn't likely to take all this lying down for long, however.
Its new products and trading techniques have been highly profitable.
Program trading money managers have gained control over a big chunk of the invested funds in this country, and the pressures on such money managers to produce consistent profits has wedded them to the ability to move rapidly in and out the market that program trading gives them.
What's more, the last time major Wall Street firms said they were getting out of program trading -- in the aftermath of the 1987 crash -- they waited a few months and then sneaked back into it.
Even some members of the Old Guard, despite their current advantage, seem to be conceding that the future belongs with the New Guard.
Last week, Robert M. Bradley, one of the Big Board's most respected floor traders and head of a major traders' organization, surrendered.
He sold his exchange seat and wrote a bitter letter to Big Board Chairman John J. Phelan Jr. in which he said the Big Board is too focused on machines, rather than people.
He said the exchange is "headed for a real crisis" if program trading isn't curbed.
"I do not want my money invested in what I consider as nothing more than a casino," Mr. Bradley wrote.
The battle has turned into a civil war at some firms and organizations, causing internal contradictions and pitting employee against employee.
At Kidder, a unit of General Electric Co., and other big brokerage firms, stockbrokers battle their own firm's program traders a few floors away.
Corporations like Contel denounce program trading, yet Contel has in the past hired pension fund managers like Bankers Trust Co. that are also big program traders.
The Big Board -- the nation's premier stock exchange -- is sharply divided between its floor traders and its top executives.
Its entrenched 49 stock specialists firms are fighting tooth and nail against programs.
But the Big Board's leadership -- over the specialists' protests -- two weeks ago began trading a new stock "basket" product designed to facilitate program trading.
"A lot of people would like to go back to 1970," before program trading, Mr. Phelan said this week.
"I would like to go back to 1970.
But we are not going back to 1970."
Again and again, program-trading's critics raise the "casino" theme.
They say greedy market manipulators have made a shambles of the nation's free-enterprise system, turning the stock market into a big gambling den, with the odds heavily stacked against the small investor.
"The public didn't come to the market to play a game; they can go to Off-Track Betting for that," says A. Brean Murray, chairman of Brean Murray, Foster Securities, a traditional money management firm.
The program traders, on the other hand, portray old-fashioned stock pickers as the Neanderthals of the industry.
Critics like Mr. Murray "are looking for witches, and people who use computers to trade are a convenient boogieman," says J. Thomas Allen, president of Advanced Investment Management Inc., a Pittsburgh firm that runs a $200 million fund that uses index arbitrage.
"Just a blind fear of the unknown is causing them to beg the regulators for protection."
For all the furor, there is nothing particularly complex about the concept of stock-index arbitrage, the most controversial type of computer-assisted program trading.
Like other forms of arbitrage, it merely seeks to take advantage of momentary discrepancies in the price of a single product -- in this case, a basket of stocks -- in different markets -- in this case the New York Stock Exchange and the Chicago futures markets.
That divergence is what stock index traders seek.
When it occurs, the traders place orders via computers to buy the basket of stocks (such as the 500 stocks that constitute the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index) in whichever market is cheaper and sell them in the more expensive market; they lock in the difference in price as profit.
Such program trades, which can involve the purchase or sale of millions of dollars of stock, occur in a matter of seconds.
A program trade of $5 million of stock typically earns a razor-thin profit of $25,000.
To keep program-trading units profitable in the eyes of senior brokerage executives, traders must seize every opportunity their computers find.
The speed with which such program trades take place and the volatile price movements they can cause are what program trading critics profess to despise.
"If you continue to do this, the investor becomes frightened -- any investor: the odd lotter, mutual funds and pension funds," says Larry Zicklin, managing partner at Neuberger & Berman.
But many experts and traders say that program trading isn't the main reason for stock-market gyrations.
"I have not seen one iota of evidence" to support restrictions on program trading, says a Vanderbilt University finance professor, Hans Stoll, an authority on the subject.
Says the Big Board's Mr. Phelan, "Volatility is greater than program trading."
The Oct. 13 plunge was triggered not by program traders, but by news of the unraveling of the $6.79 billion buy-out of UAL Corp.
Unable to unload UAL and other airline shares, takeover-stock speculators, or risk arbitragers, dumped every blue-chip stock they had.
While program trades swiftly kicked in, a "circuit breaker" that halted trading in stock futures in Chicago made some program trading impossible.
Susan Del Signore, head trader at Travelers Investment Management Co., says critics are ignoring "the role the {takeover stock} speculator is taking in the market as a source of volatility."
Many arbs are "overleveraged," she says, and they "have to sell when things look like they fall apart."
Like virtually everything on Wall Street, the program-trading battle is over money, and the traditionalists have been losing out on bundles of it to the New Guard in recent years.
Take the traditional money managers, or "stock pickers," as they are derisively known among the computer jockeys.
Traditional stock managers like to charge 50 cents to 75 cents for every $100 they manage for big institutional investors, and higher fees for smaller investors.
Not surprisingly, old-style money managers have been losing clients to giant stock-index funds that use computers to juggle portfolios so they mirror the S&P 500.
The indexers charge only a few pennies per $100 managed.
Today, about $200 billion, or 20% of all pension-fund stock investments, is held by index funds.
The new Wall Street of computers and automated trading threatens to make dinosaurs of the 49 Big Board stock-specialist firms.
These small but influential floor brokers long have earned fat returns of 30% to 40% a year on their capital, by virtue of their monopoly in making markets in individual stocks.
The specialists see any step to electronic trading as a death knell.
And they believe the Big Board, under Mr. Phelan, has abandoned their interest.
The son of a specialist and once one himself, Mr. Phelan has nonetheless been striving -- with products like the new stock basket that his former colleagues dislike so much -- to keep index funds and other program traders from taking their business to overseas markets.
Meanwhile, specialists' trading risks have skyrocketed as a result of stock-market volatility.
"When the sell programs hit, you can hear the order printers start to go" on the Big Board trading floor, says one specialist there.
"The buyers walk away, and the specialist is left alone" as the buyer of last resort for his stable of stocks, he contends.
No one is more unhappy with program trading than the nation's stockbrokers.
They are still trying to lure back small investors spooked by the 1987 stock-market crash and the market's swings since then.
"Small investors are absolutely dismayed that Wall Street is stacking the deck against them, and these wide swings are scaring them to death," says Raymond A. Mason, chairman of regional broker Legg Mason Inc. in Baltimore.
Stockbrokers' business and pay has been falling.
Last year, the average broker earned $71,309, 24% lower than in 1987.
Corporate executives resent that their company's stock has been transformed into a nameless piece of a stock-index basket.
Index traders who buy all 500 stocks in the S&P 500 often don't even know what the companies they own actually do, complains Andrew Sigler, chairman of Champion International Corp.
"Do you make sweatshirts or sparkplugs?
Oh, you're in the paper business," is one reaction Mr. Sigler says he's gotten from his big institutional shareholders.
By this September, program traders were doing a record 13.8% of the Big Board's average daily trading volume.
Among the top practitioners were Wall Street blue bloods: Morgan Stanley & Co., Kidder Peabody, Merrill Lynch, Salomon Brothers Inc. and PaineWebber Group Inc.
But then came Oct. 13 and the negative publicity orchestrated by the Old Guard, particularly against index arbitrage.
The indexers' strategy for the moment is to hunker down and let the furor die.
"There's a lynch-mob psychology right now," says the top program-trading official at a Wall Street firm.
"Wall Street's cash cow has been gored, but I don't think anyone has proven that index arbitrage is the problem."
Too much money is at stake for program traders to give up.
For example, stock-index futures began trading in Chicago in 1982, and within two years they were the fastest-growing futures contract ever launched.
Stock futures trading has minted dozens of millionaires in their 20s and 30s.
Now, on a good day, Chicago's stock-index traders trade more dollars worth of stock futures than the Big Board trades in stock.
Now the stage is set for the battle to play out.
The anti-programmers are getting some helpful thunder from Congress.
Program traders' "power to create total panic is so great that they can't be allowed to have their way," says Rep. Edward Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat.
`Sit down!
But the prospects for legislation that targets program trading is unlikely anytime soon.
Many people, including the Big Board, think that it's too late to put the genie back in the bottle.
The Big Board's directors meet today to approve some program-trading restrictions, but a total ban isn't being considered, Big Board officials say.
Program trading is here to stay, and computers are here to stay, and we just need to understand it."
Short of a total ban, some anti-programmers have proposed several middle-ground reforms, which they say would take away certain advantages program traders currently enjoy in the marketplace that other investors don't.
One such proposal regarding stock-index futures is an increase in the margin requirement -- or the "good-faith" payment of cash needed to trade them -- to about the same level as the margin requirement for stocks.
Currently, margins on stock futures purchases are much lower -- roughly 7% compared with 50% for stocks -- making the futures market much faster and potentially more speculative.
Program trading critics also want the Federal Reserve Board, rather than the futures industry, to set such margins.
Futures traders respond that low margins help keep their markets active.
Higher margins would chase away dozens of smaller traders who help larger traders buy and sell, they say.
Another proposed reform is to have program traders answer to an "uptick rule" a reform instituted after the Great Crash of 1929 that protects against stocks being relentlessly beaten downward by those seeking to profit from lower prices, namely short sellers.
The Big Board's uptick rule prevents the short sale of a stock when the stock is falling in price.
But in 1986, program traders received what amounted to an exemption from the uptick rule in certain situations, to make it easier to link the stock and futures markets.
A reinstatement of the uptick rule for program traders would slow their activity considerably.
Program traders argue that a reinstatement of the rule would destroy the "pricing efficiency" of the futures and stock markets.
James A. White contributed to this article.
Big Board Chairman John Phelan said yesterday that he could support letting federal regulators suspend program trading during wild stock-price swings.
Thus the band-wagon psychology of recent days picks up new impetus.
Index arbitrage is a common form of program trading.
As usually practiced it takes advantage of a rather basic concept: Two separate markets in different locations, trading basically the same widgets, can't trade them for long at prices that are widely different.
In index arbitrage, the widget is the S&P 500, and its price is constantly compared between the futures market in Chicago and the stock markets largely in New York.
To profit from an index-arbitrage opportunity, someone who owns the S&P 500 widget in New York must sell it and replace it with a cheaper S&P 500 widget in Chicago.
If the money manager performing this service is being paid by his clients to match or beat the return of the S&P 500 index, he is likely to remain fully invested at all times.
By constantly seeking to own the cheapest widget, index-arbitrage traders hope to add between 1% and 3% to the annual return of the S&P 500.
That represents a very thin "excess" return, certainly far less than what most fundamental stock pickers claim to seek as their performance objective.
The fact that a vast majority of fundamentalist money managers fail to beat the S&P 500 may contribute to the hysteria surrounding the issue.
As more managers pursue the index-arbitrage strategy, these small opportunities between markets will be reduced and, eventually, eliminated.
The current opportunities arise because the process for executing a buy or sell order in the actual stocks that make up the S&P 500 is more cumbersome than transacting in the futures market.
The New York Stock Exchange's attempt to introduce a new portfolio basket is evidence of investors' desires to make fast and easy transactions of large numbers of shares.
So if index arbitrage is simply taking advantage of thin inefficiencies between two markets for the same widget, how did "program trading" evolve into the evil creature that is evoking the curses of so many observers?
All arguments against program trading, even those pressed without fact, conclude with three expected results after "reforms" are implemented: 1) reduced volatility, 2) a long-term investment focus, and 3) a level playing field for the small investor.
But many of these reforms are unneeded, even harmful.
Reducing volatility.
An index-arbitrage trade is never executed unless there is sufficient difference between the markets in New York and Chicago to cover all transaction costs.
Arbitrage doesn't cause volatility; it responds to it.
Think about what causes the difference in prices between the two markets for S&P 500 stocks -- usually it is large investors initiating a buy or sell in Chicago.
A large investor will likely cause the futures market to decline when he sells his futures.
Arbitrage simply transfers his selling pressure from Chicago to New York, while functioning as a buyer in Chicago.
The start of the whole process is the key-someone must fundamentally increase or decrease his ownership in widgets to make widget prices move.
Why does this large hypothetical seller trade in Chicago instead of New York?
Perhaps he is willing to sacrifice to the arbitrage trader some small profit in order to get quick and certain execution of his large trade.
In a competitive market, this investor has many ways to execute his transactions, and he will have more alternatives (both foreign and domestic) if his volume is profitable for an exchange to handle.
If not Chicago, then in New York; if not the U.S., then overseas.
Volatility surrounding his trades occurs not because of index arbitrage, but because his is a large addition or subtraction to a widget market with finite liquidity.
Eliminate arbitrage and liquidity will decline instead of rising, creating more volatility instead of less.
The speed of his transaction isn't to be feared either, because faster and cleaner execution is desirable, not loathsome.
If slowing things down could reduce volatility, stone tablets should become the trade ticket of the future.
Encouraging long-term investing.
We must be very cautious about labeling investors as "long-term" or "short-term."
Policies designed to encourage one type of investor over another are akin to placing a sign over the Big Board's door saying: "Buyers welcome, sellers please go away!"
The ultimate goal of any investor is a profit motive, and regulators should not concern themselves with whether investors are sufficiently focused on the long term.
A free market with a profit motive will attract each investor to the liquidity and risks he can tolerate.
In point of fact, volatility as measured by the annualized standard deviation of daily stock price movements has frequently been much higher than it is today.
Periods before the advent of futures or program trading were often more volatile, usually when fundamental market conditions were undergoing change (1973-75, 1937-40, and 1928-33 for example).
It is interesting to see the fundamental stock pickers scream "foul" on program trading when the markets decline, while hailing the great values still abounding as the markets rise.
Could rising volatility possibly be related to uncertainty about the economics of stocks, instead of the evil deeds of program-trading goblins?
Some of the proposed fixes for what is labeled "program-trading volatility" could be far worse than the perceived problem.
In using program trading as a whipping boy, fundamentalist investors stand to gain the high ground in wooing small investors for their existing stock-selection products.
They may, however, risk bringing some damaging interference from outside the markets themselves.
How does a nice new tax, say 5%, on any financial transaction sound?
That ought to make sure we're all thinking for the long term.
Getting a level playing field.
This argument is perhaps the most interesting one for abolishing program trading -- not because of its merits, but because of the firms championing the cause.
The loudest of these reformers are money managers who cater to smaller investors.
They continually advise their clients on which individual stocks to buy or sell, while their clients continue to hope for superior performance.
Even with mutual funds, the little investor continues to tolerate high fees, high commissions and poor performance, while index-fund managers slowly amass a better record with lower fees, lower commissions and less risk.
Yet our efforts are somehow less noble than those of an investment expert studiously devouring press clippings on each company he follows.
Almost all new regulation is introduced in the interests of protecting the little guy, and he invariably is the one least able to cope with its consequences.
If spreads available from index arbitrage are so enormous, surely any sizable mutual-fund company could profit from offering it to small investors.
The sad reality is that the retail investor continues to pursue stellar performers first, while leaving institutions to grapple with basis points of performance on large sums of money quarter by quarter.
Cost-effective index funds just aren't sexy enough to justify the high fees and commissions that retail customers frequently pay, and that institutional customers refuse to pay.
Each new trading roadblock is likely to be beaten by institutions seeking better ways to serve their high-volume clients, here or overseas.
Legislating new trading inefficiencies will only make things harder on the least sophisticated investors.
So what is next for program trading?
Left to its own devices, index arbitrage will become more and more efficient, making it harder and harder to do profitably.
Spreads will become so tight that it won't matter which market an investor chooses -- arbitrage will prevent him from gaining any temporary profit.
If government or private watchdogs insist, however, on introducing greater friction between the markets (limits on price moves, two-tiered execution, higher margin requirements, taxation, etc.), the end loser will be the markets themselves.
Instead, we ought to be inviting more liquidity with cheaper ways to trade and transfer capital among all participants.
Mr. Allen's Pittsburgh firm, Advanced Investment Management Inc., executes program trades for institutions.
Some Democrats in Congress are warning that a complicated new funding device for the two federal antitrust agencies could result in further cutbacks in a regulatory area already reduced sharply in recent years.
The funding mechanism, which has received congressional approval and is expected to be signed by President Bush, would affect the antitrust operations of the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission.
As a part of overall efforts to reduce spending, Congress cut by $30 million the Bush administration's request for antitrust enforcement for fiscal 1990, which began Oct. 1.
To offset the reduction, Congress approved a $20,000 fee that investors and companies will have to pay each time they make required filings to antitrust regulators about mergers, acquisitions and certain other transactions.
Some Democrats, led by Rep. Jack Brooks (D., Texas), unsuccessfully opposed the measure because they fear that the fees may not fully make up for the budget cuts.
But Justice Department and FTC officials said they expect the filing fees to make up for the budget reductions and possibly exceed them.
"It could operate to augment our budget," James Rill, the Justice Department's antitrust chief, said in an interview.
Under measures approved by both houses of Congress, the administration's request for $47 million for the Antitrust Division would be cut $15 million.
The FTC budget request of $70 million, about $34 million of which would go for antitrust enforcement, would also be cut by $15 million.
The administration had requested roughly the same amount for antitrust enforcement for fiscal 1990 as was appropriated in fiscal 1989.
The offsetting fees would apply to filings made under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act.
Under that law, parties proposing mergers or acquisitions valued at $15 million or more must notify FTC and Justice Department antitrust regulators before completing the transactions.
Currently, the government charges nothing for such filings.
Proponents of the funding arrangement predict that, based on recent filing levels of more than 2,000 a year, the fees will yield at least $40 million this fiscal year, or $10 million more than the budget cuts.
"When you do that, there is not a cut, but there is in fact a program increase of $5 million" each for the FTC and the Justice Department, Rep. Neal Smith (D., Iowa) said during House debate.
But Rep. Don Edwards (D., Calif.) responded that a recession could stifle merger activity, reducing the amount of fees collected.
The antitrust staffs of both the FTC and Justice Department were cut more than 40% in the Reagan administration, and enforcement of major merger cases fell off drastically during that period.
"Today is not the time to signal that Congress in any way sanctions the dismal state into which antitrust enforcement has fallen," Mr. Edwards argued.
Any money in excess of $40 million collected from the fees in fiscal 1990 would go to the Treasury at large.
Corporate lawyers said the new fees wouldn't inhibit many mergers or other transactions.
Though some lawyers reported that prospective acquirers were scrambling to make filings before the fees take effect, government officials said they hadn't noticed any surge in filings.
FALL BALLOT ISSUES set a record for off-year elections.
Odd-year elections attract relatively few ballot issues.
But the 1989 fall total of 80, while well below 1988 activity, shows "a steady ratcheting up in citizen referenda and initiatives," says Patrick McGuigan, editor of Family, Law and Democracy Report.
He says the 10 citizen-sparked issues on state ballots this fall represent the most in any odd-year this decade.
Ballot questions range from a Maine initiative on banning Cruise missiles to a referendum on increasing the North Dakota income tax.
Ballot watchers say attention already is focused on the 1990 elections.
In California, two petition drives for next year's election are "essentially finished," says David Schmidt, author of "Citizen Lawmakers."
Mr. McGuigan cites three completed efforts in Oklahoma.
Hot ballot topics are expected to be abortion, the environment and insurance reform.
Taking a cue from California, more politicians will launch their campaigns by backing initiatives, says David Magleby of Brigham Young University.
PHOTOGRAPH COLLECTING gains new stature as prices rise.
Price records are being set at auctions this week.
At Christie's, a folio of 21 prints from Alfred Stieglitz's "Equivalents" series sold for $396,000, a single-lot record.
Other works also have been exceeding price estimates.
In part, prices reflect development of a market structure based on such variables as the number of prints.
This information used to be poorly documented and largely anecdotal, says Beth Gates-Warren of Sotheby's.
"There is finally some sort of sense in the market," she says.
Corporations and museums are among the serious buyers, giving greater market stability, says Robert Persky of the Photograph Collector.
"When I see prints going into the hands of institutions, I know they aren't going to come back on the market."
Most in demand: classic photographs by masters such as Stieglitz and Man Ray.
But much contemporary work is also fetching "a great deal of money," says Miles Barth of the International Center of Photography.
DIALING 900 brings callers a growing number of services.
Currently a $300 million-a-year business, 900 telephone service is expected to hit $500 million next year and near $2 billion by 1992 as uses for the service continue to expand, says Joel Gross of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc.
The service -- which costs the caller from 30 cents to $25 a minute -- currently is dominated by celebrity chatter, horoscopes and romance lines.
But more serious applications are in the wings, and that is where the future growth is expected.
"I'm starting to see more business transactions," says Andrea West of American Telephone & Telegraph Co., noting growing interest in use of 900 service for stock sales, software tutorials and even service contracts.
Colleges, she says, are eyeing registration through 900 service.
Charities test the waters, but they face legal barriers to electronic fund raising.
"The thing that will really break this market right open is merchandising," Ms. West says.
Much of the 800 service will "migrate to 900," predicts Jack Lawless, general manager of US Sprint's 900 product.
FAMILY PETS are improving recovery rates of patients at Columbia Hospital, Milwaukee.

Funded by a $1 million gift from Tokio Marine & Fire Insurance, the service will follow Japanese medical protocols, including emphasis on preventative medicine.
DIAPER SERVICES make a comeback amid growing environmental concerns.
Concerned about shrinking landfills and the safety of chemicals used in super-absorbent disposables, parents are returning to the cloth diaper.
Tiny Tots Inc., Campbell, Calif., says business is up 35% in the past year.
"We're gaining 1,200 new customers each week," says Jack Mogavero of General Health Care Corp., Piscataway, N.J.
In Syracuse, N.Y., DyDee Service's new marketing push stresses environmental awareness.
Among its new customers: day-care centers that previously spurned the service.
The National Association of Diaper Services, Philadelphia, says that since January it has gotten more than 672 inquiries from people interested in starting diaper services.
Elisa Hollis launched a diaper service last year because State College, Pa., where she lives, didn't have one.
Also spurring the move to cloth: diaper covers with Velcro fasteners that eliminate the need for safety pins.
Only 57.6% of New Yorkers watch the local news, the lowest viewership in the country, says a new study by Impact Resources Inc., Columbus, Ohio....

Program trading is "a racket," complains Edward Egnuss, a White Plains, N.Y., investor and electronics sales executive, "and it's not to the benefit of the small investor, that's for sure."
But although he thinks that it is hurting him, he doubts it could be stopped.
Mr. Egnuss's dislike of program trading is echoed by many small investors interviewed by Wall Street Journal reporters across the country.
But like Mr. Egnuss, few expect it to be halted entirely, and a surprising number doubt it should be.
"I think program trading is basically unfair to the individual investor," says Leo Fields, a Dallas investor.
He notes that program traders have a commission cost advantage because of the quantity of their trades, that they have a smaller margin requirement than individual investors do and that they often can figure out earlier where the market is heading.
But he blames program trading for only some of the market's volatility.
He also considers the market overvalued and cites the troubles in junk bonds.
He adds: "The market may be giving us another message, that a recession is looming."
Or, as Dorothy Arighi, an interior decorator in Arnold, Calif., puts it: "All kinds of funny things spook the market these days."
But she believes that "program trading creates deviant swings.
It's not a sound thing; there's no inherent virtue in it."
She adds that legislation curbing it would be "a darned good idea."
At the Charles Schwab & Co. office in Atlanta's Buckhead district, a group of investors voices skepticism that federal officials would curb program trading.
Citing the October 1987 crash, Glenn Miller says, "It's like the last crash -- they threatened, but no one did anything."
A. Donald Anderson, a 59-year-old Los Angeles investor who says the stock market's "fluctuations and gyrations give me the heebie-jeebies," doesn't see much point in outlawing program trading.
Those who still want to do it "will just find some way to get around" any attempt to curb it.
Similarly, Rick Wamre, a 31-year-old asset manager for a Dallas real-estate firm, would like to see program trading disappear because "I can't see that it does anything for the market or the country."
Yet he isn't in favor of new legislation.
"I think we've got enough securities laws," he says.
"I'd much rather see them dealing with interest rates and the deficit."
Peter Anthony, who runs an employment agency in New York, decries program trading as "limiting the game to a few," but he also isn't sure it should be more strictly regulated.
"I don't want to denounce it because denouncing it would be like denouncing capitalism," he explains.
And surprising numbers of small investors seem to be adapting to greater stock market volatility and say they can live with program trading.
Glenn Britta, a 25-year-old New York financial analyst who plays options for his personal account, says he is "factoring" the market's volatility "into investment decisions."
He adds that program trading "increases liquidity in the market.
You can't hold back technology."
And the practice shouldn't be stopped, he says, because "even big players aren't immune to the rigors of program trading."
Also in New York, Israel Silverman, an insurance-company lawyer, comments that program trading "increases volatility, but I don't think it should be banned.
There's no culprit here.
The market is just becoming more efficient."
Arbitraging on differences between spot and futures prices is an important part of many financial markets, he says.
He adds that his shares in a company savings plan are invested in a mutual fund, and volatility, on a given day, may hurt the fund.
But "I'm a long-term investor," he says.
"If you were a short-term investor, you might be more leery about program trading."
Jim Enzor of Atlanta defends program trading because he believes that it can bring the market back up after a plunge.
"If we have a real bad day, the program would say, `Buy,' '' he explains.
"If you could get the rhythm of the program trading, you could take advantage of it."
What else can a small investor do?
Scott Taccetta, a Chicago accountant, is going into money-market funds.
Mr. Taccetta says he had just recouped the $5,000 he lost in the 1987 crash when he lost more money last Oct. 13.
Now, he plans to sell all his stocks by the first quarter of 1990.
In October, before the market dropped, Mrs. Arighi of Arnold, Calif., moved to sell the "speculative stocks" in her family trust "so we will be able to withstand all this flim-flammery" caused by program trading.
She believes that the only answer for individuals is to "buy stocks that'll weather any storm."
Lucille Gorman, an 84-year-old Chicago housewife, has become amazingly immune to stock-market jolts.
Mrs. Gorman took advantage of low prices after the 1987 crash to buy stocks and has hunted for other bargains since the Oct. 13 plunge.
"My stocks are all blue chips," she says.
"If the market goes down, I figure it's paper profits I'm losing.
On the other hand, if it goes way sky high, I always sell.
You don't want to get yourself too upset about these things.
Young's Market Co., a wholesaler of spirits, wines and other goods, said it will merge with a new corporation formed by the Underwood family, which controls Young's.
Under terms of the agreement, shareholders other than the Underwoods will receive $3,500 a share at closing, which is expected in December.
The Underwood family said that holders of more than a majority of the stock of the company have approved the transaction by written consent.
Researchers at American Telephone & Telegraph Co.'s Bell Laboratories reported they raised the electrical current-carrying capacity of new superconductor crystals by a factor of 100, moving the materials closer to commercial use.
The scientists said they created small changes in the crystal-lattice structures of the superconductors to raise the amount of current that single crystals could carry to 600,000 amps per square centimeter in a moderately strong magnetic field.
The scientists said they made the advance with yttrium-containing superconductors cooled to liquid-nitrogen temperature, or minus 321 degrees Fahrenheit.
Their report appears in today's issue of the journal Nature.
The finding marks a significant step in research on "bulk" superconductors, which are aimed at use in wires for motors, magnets, generators and other applications.
Scientists had obtained even higher current-carrying capacity in thin films of the new superconductors, but have had problems increasing the amount of current that bulk crystals could carry.
Superconductors conduct electricity without resistance when cooled.
A family of ceramic superconductors discovered during the past three years promise new technologies such as cheaper electrical generation -- but only if their current-carrying capacity can be raised.
The AT&T advance shows how one aspect of the current-carrying problem can be overcome.
But "it won't lead to imminent use" of new superconductors, cautioned Robert B. van Dover, one of the AT&T researchers.
He added that the current-carrying capacity of multi-crystal samples of superconductors remains too low for most practical uses because of so-called weak links between crystals.
Such multi-crystal materials will probably be needed for commercial applications.
Mr. van Dover said the AT&T team created the desired crystal changes by bombarding superconductor samples with neutrons, a process that creates some radioactivity in the samples and may not be feasible for large-scale commercial use.
Still, scientists breathed a collective sigh of relief about the finding, because it demonstrates how to overcome the "flux pinning" problem that earlier this year was widely publicized as undercutting new superconductors' potential.
The problem involves the motion of small magnetic fields within superconductor crystals, limiting their current-carrying capacity.
Mr. van Dover said the crystal changes his team introduced apparently pins the magnetic fields in place, preventing them from lowering current-carrying capacity.
Mr. van Dover added that researchers are trying to determine precisely what crystal changes solved the problem.
Determining that may enable them to develop better ways to introduce the needed crystal-lattice patterns.
The AT&T team also is trying to combine their latest superconductor process with "melt-textured growth," a process discovered earlier at Bell Laboratories.
The combined processes may significantly raise the current-carrying capacity of multi-crystal samples.
William C. Walbrecher Jr., an executive at San Francisco-based 1st Nationwide Bank, was named president and chief executive officer of Citadel Holding Corp. and its principal operating unit, Fidelity Federal Bank.
The appointment takes effect Nov. 13.
He succeeds James A. Taylor, who stepped down as chairman, president and chief executive in March for health reasons.
Edward L. Kane succeeded Mr. Taylor as chairman.
Separately, Citadel posted a third-quarter net loss of $2.3 million, or 68 cents a share, versus net income of $5.3 million, or $1.61 a share, a year earlier.
The latest results include some unusual write-downs, which had an after-tax impact of $4.9 million.
Those included costs associated with the potential Valley Federal Savings and Loan Association acquisition, which was terminated on Sept. 27, 1989.
In addition, operating results were hit by an increase in loan and real estate loss reserves.
In American Stock Exchange composite trading, Citadel shares closed yesterday at $45.75, down 25 cents.

Although his team lost the World Series, San Francisco Giants owner Bob Lurie hopes to have a new home for them.
He is an avid fan of a proposition on next week's ballot to help build a replacement for Candlestick Park.
Small wonder, since he's asking San Francisco taxpayers to sink up to $100 million into the new stadium.
As San Francisco digs out from The Pretty Big One, opponents say the last thing the city can afford is an expensive new stadium.
A stadium craze is sweeping the country.
It's fueled by the increasing profitability of major-league teams.
Something like one-third of the nation's 60 largest cities are thinking about new stadiums, ranging from Cleveland to San Antonio and St. Petersburg.
Most boosters claim the new sports complexes will be moneymakers for their city.
Pepperdine University economist Dean Baim scoffs at that.
He has looked at 14 baseball and football stadiums and found that only one -- private Dodger Stadium -- brought more money into a city than it took out.
Stadiums tend to redistribute existing wealth within a community, not create more of it.
Voters generally agree when they are given a chance to decide if they want to sink their own tax dollars into a new mega-stadium.
San Francisco voters rejected a new ballpark two years ago.
Last month, Phoenix voters turned thumbs down on a $100 million stadium bond and tax proposition.
Its backers fielded every important interest on their team -- a popular mayor, the Chamber of Commerce, the major media -- and spent $100,000 on promotion.
But voters decided that if the stadium was such a good idea someone would build it himself, and rejected it 59% to 41%.
In San Francisco, its backers concede the ballpark is at best running even in the polls.
George Christopher, the former San Francisco mayor who built Candlestick Park for the Giants in the 1960s, won't endorse the new ballpark.
He says he had Candlestick built because the Giants claimed they needed 10,000 parking spaces.
Since the new park will have only 1,500 spaces, Mr. Christopher thinks backers are playing some fiscal "games" of their own with the voters.
Stadium boosters claim that without public money they would never be built.
Miami Dolphins owner Joe Robbie disagrees, and he can prove it.
Several years ago he gave up trying to persuade Miami to improve its city-owned Orange Bowl, and instead built his own $100 million coliseum with private funds.
He didn't see why the taxpayers should help build something he would then use to turn a healthy profit.
"This stadium shows that anything government can do, we can do better," Mr. Robbie says.
But to Moon Landrieu, the former New Orleans mayor who helped build that city's cavernous, money-losing Superdome, questions of who benefits or the bottom line are of little relevance.
"The Superdome is an exercise in optimism, a statement of faith," he has said.
"It is the very building of it that is important, not how much of it is used or its economics."
An Egyptian Pharaoh couldn't have justified his pyramids any better.
But civilization has moved forward since then.
Today taxpayers get to vote, most of the time, on whether they want to finance the building schemes of our modern political pharaohs, or let private money erect these playgrounds for public passions.
Reed International PLC said that net income for the six months ended Oct. 1 slipped 5% to # 89.7 million ($141.9 million), or 16 pence a share, from # 94.8 million ($149.9 million), or 17.3 pence a share.
The British paper, packaging and publishing concern, said profit from continuing lines fell 10% to # 118 million from # 130.6 million.
While there were no one-time gains or losses in the latest period, there was a one-time gain of # 18 million in the 1988 period.
And while there was no profit this year from discontinued operations, last year they contributed # 34 million, before tax.
Pretax profit fell 3.7% to # 128 million from # 133 million and was below analysts' expectations of # 130 million to # 135 million, but shares rose 6 pence to 388 pence in early trading yesterday in London.
Reed is paying an interim dividend of 4.6 pence, up 15% from 4 pence a year earlier.
Sales fell 20% to # 722 million.
Earnings were hurt by disposal of operations in its restructuring, Reed said.
Wall Street's big securities firms face the prospect of having their credit ratings lowered.
The reason: Risks from the firms' new "merchant banking" activities are rising as revenue from the industry's traditional business erodes.
The downgrading of debt issued by CS First Boston Inc., parent of First Boston Corp., by Moody's Investors Service Inc., coupled with a Moody's announcement that Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc. is under review for a possible downgrade, sent shivers through the brokerage community this week.
With the shudders came the realization that some of Wall Street's biggest players are struggling to maintain the stellar credit standing required to finance their activities profitably.
Securities firms are among the biggest issuers of commercial paper, or short-term corporate IOUs, which they sell to finance their daily operations.
The biggest firms still retain the highest ratings on their commercial paper.
But Moody's warned that Shearson's commercial paper rating could be lowered soon, a move that would reduce Shearson's profit margins on its borrowings and signal trouble ahead for other firms.
Shearson is 62%-owned by American Express Co.
"Just as the 1980s bull market transformed the U.S. securities business, so too will the more difficult environment of the 1990s," says Christopher T. Mahoney, a Moody's vice president.
"A sweeping restructuring of the industry is possible."
Standard & Poor's Corp. says First Boston, Shearson and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., in particular, are likely to have difficulty shoring up their credit standing in months ahead.
What worries credit-rating concerns the most is that Wall Street firms are taking long-term risks with their own capital via leveraged buy-out and junk bond financings.
That's a departure from their traditional practice of transferring almost all financing risks to investors.
Whereas conventional securities financings are structured to be sold quickly, Wall Street's new penchant for leveraged buy-outs and junk bonds is resulting in long-term lending commitments that stretch out for months or years.
"The recent disarray in the junk bond market suggests that brokers may become longer-term creditors than they anticipated and may face long delays" in getting their money back, says Jeffrey Bowman, a vice president at S&P, which raised a warning flag for the industry in April when it downgraded CS First Boston.
"Wall Street is facing a Catch-22 situation," says Mr. Mahoney of Moody's.
Merchant banking, where firms commit their own money, "is getting riskier, and there's less of it to go around."
In addition, he says, the buy-out business is under pressure "because of the junk bond collapse," meaning that returns are likely to decline as the volume of junk-bond financings shrinks.
In a leveraged buy-out, a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing, with the expectation that the debt will be paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or sales of its assets.
In a recent report, Moody's said it "expects intense competition to occur through the rest of the century in the securities industry, which, combined with overcapacity, will create poor prospects for profitability."
It said that the "temptation for managements to ease this profit pressure by taking greater risks is an additional rating factor."
Both Moody's and S&P cited First Boston's reliance in recent years on merchant banking, which has been responsible for a significant portion of the closely held firm's profit.
The recent cash squeeze at Campeau Corp., First Boston's most lucrative client of the decade, is proving costly to First Boston because it arranged more than $3 billion of high-yield, high-risk junk financings for Campeau units.
In addition, a big loan that First Boston made to Ohio Mattress Co. wasn't repaid on time when its $450 million junk financing for a buy-out of the bedding company was withdrawn.
"These two exposures alone represent a very substantial portion of CS First Boston's equity," Moody's said.
"Total merchant banking exposures are in excess of the firm's equity."
CS First Boston, however, benefits from the backing of its largest shareholder, Credit Suisse, Switzerland's third largest bank.
Shearson also has been an aggressive participant in the leveraged buy-out business.
But its earnings became a major disappointment as its traditional retail, or individual investor, business showed no signs of rebounding from the slump that followed the October 1987 stock market crash.
In addition, Shearson's listed $2 billion of capital is overstated, according to the rating concerns, because it includes $1.7 billion of goodwill.
Shearson "really only has $300 million of capital," says Mr. Bowman of S&P.
A Shearson spokesman said the firm isn't worried.
"A year ago, Moody's also had Shearson under review for possible downgrade," he said.
"After two months of talks, our rating was maintained."
Drexel, meanwhile, already competes at a disadvantage to its big Wall Street rivals because it has a slightly lower commercial paper rating.
The collapse of junk bond prices and the cancellation of many junk bond financings apparently have taken their toll on closely held Drexel, the leading underwriter in that market.
The firm also has been hit with big financial settlements with the government stemming from its guilty plea to six felonies related to a big insider-trading scandal.
Drexel this year eliminated its retail or individual customer business, cutting the firm's workforce almost in half to just over 5,000.
Recently, Drexel circulated a private financial statement among several securities firms showing that its earnings performance has diminished this year from previous years.
The firm's capital, moreover, hasn't grown at the same rate as in the past, officials at these firms say.
Drexel remains confident of its future creditworthiness.
"We're well positioned with $1.7 billion of capital," a Drexel spokesman said.
"And as a leading investment and merchant banking firm, the fact that we are no longer subject to the uncertainties and vicissitudes of the retail business is a major plus in our view.
Moreover, we've probably been the most aggressive firm on the Street in reducing costs, which are down around 40% over the last six months.
Lewis C. Veraldi, the father of the team that created the highly successful Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable cars, retired early after experiencing recent heart problems.
Most recently, Mr. Veraldi, 59 years old, has been vice president of product and manufacturing engineering at Ford Motor Co.
But he is best known in the auto industry as the creator of a team car-development approach that produced the two midsized cars that were instrumental in helping the No. 2 auto maker record profits in recent years and in enabling the company's Ford division to eclipse General Motors Corp.'s Chevrolet division as the top-selling nameplate in the U.S..
Under the so-called Team Taurus approach, Mr. Veraldi and other Ford product planners sought the involvement of parts suppliers, assembly-line workers, auto designers and financial staff members from the initial stages of the development cycle.
The concept's goal was to eliminate bureaucracy and make Ford's product development more responsive to consumer demands.
It was later applied to other new-car programs, including those that produced the Ford Thunderbird and Mercury Cougar.
Ford Chairman Donald E. Petersen said yesterday that Mr. Veraldi has "helped to change the world's perception of American-made cars."
Mr. Veraldi worked at Ford for 40 years, holding a variety of car and parts-engineering positions.
The limits to legal absurdity stretched another notch this week when the Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal from a case that says corporate defendants must pay damages even after proving that they could not possibly have caused the harm.
We can understand and share the compassion that makes judges sometimes wish to offer a kind of Solomonic aid to those who've been hurt.
But this case is a stark lesson in how the failures of the traditional policy-making process have left the courts as the only forum this country has to debate risk, technology and innovation.
Too often now, a single court decision becomes the precedent for other, less compelling cases.
From the 1940s until 1971, some two million women took the synthetic hormone diethylstilbestrol (DES) to prevent miscarriages and morning sickness.
The drug was approved by the Food and Drug Administration and marketed by some 300 pharmaceutical companies, often under generic labels.
In the 1970s, scientists reported cancer cases among the daughters of DES users.
The cases quickly went to court, but the mothers of several thousand DES plaintiffs couldn't recall whose brand they used.
Beginning in 1980, courts in several states including California and New York decided to suspend the common-law rule that plaintiffs must prove that the defendants are the ones who are liable.
Courts made the assumption that all DES pills were essentially the same, and created a market-share test so that damages would be assessed against drug makers in the proportion of their share of the original sales.
This has some logic.
Drug makers shouldn't be able to duck liability because people couldn't identify precisely which identical drug was used.
But courts quickly tumbled down a slippery slope.
Just as all plaintiffs are not alike, it turns out that DES defendants marketed the drugs differently and may have offered different warranties.
The ultimate result came in Hymowitz v. Lilly, where the highest New York court expanded the market-share approach for the first time to say that drug makers that could prove Mindy Hymowitz's mother didn't use their pill must still pay their share of any damages.
But as Duke University law professor William Van Alstyne notes, by this reasoning a defendant could be held liable in New York for a bad apple even if he sold all his apples in California.
Despite the Supreme Court's refusal to hear the case, there are serious constitutional issues of due process and uncompensated takings from the defendants.
The big problem, however, is that there's no guarantee that this reasoning will be limited to DES or to drugs.
The problem here goes well beyond twisting legal doctrine.
The California Supreme Court last year reversed direction to make it much harder to win DES cases because the justices saw how all the pharmaceutical litigation has chilled the introduction of new drugs.
The court rejected strict liability for prescription drugs, citing the huge, hidden social costs.
"Public policy favors the development and marketing of beneficial new drugs, even though some risks, perhaps serious ones, might accompany their introduction because drugs can save lives and reduce pain and suffering," the unanimous court said.
The California justices noted that the fear of litigation already forced the only remaining anti-morning-sickness drug, Bendectin, off the U.S. market.
This raises the key issue: What to do about people who suffer serious injuries from beneficial drugs?
We now know that holding drug makers liable where there's no evidence that they or anyone else knew of any risks only means the drugs won't be available to anyone.
As liability expert Peter Huber tells us, after the Hymowitz case, if any drug maker introduces an anti-miscarriage drug "it's time to sell that company's stock short."
We also know that the tort system is a lousy way to compensate victims anyway; some win the legal lottery, others get much less and contingency-fee lawyers take a big cut either way.
DES daughters and other victims of drugs would be better off if their cases were taken out of the courts.
Congress could create a compensation program to help such victims while protecting the national interest in encouraging new drugs.
But a 1986 law that supposedly replaced lawsuits over children's vaccines with a compensation fund has predictably led to even more litigation.
Everyone by now understands that Congress is utterly incapable of writing legislation to help deserving people without its becoming some billion-dollar morass.
We have no doubt this is one reason judges in New York and justices on the Supreme Court are willing to trash the law in the DES cases.
They must figure that justice has to get done by somebody, but know it won't be done by Congress.
Odyssey Partners Limited Partnership, an investment firm, completed the purchase of May Department Stores Co.'s Caldor discount chain for $500 million plus the assumption of $52 million in debt.
Caldor, based in Norwalk, Conn., operates 118 stores in the Northeast; it reported revenue of $1.6 billion last year.
May Stores, St. Louis, runs such well-known department stores as Lord & Taylor.
N.V. DSM said net income in the third quarter jumped 63% as the company had substantially lower extraordinary charges to account for a restructuring program.
The Dutch chemical group said net income gained to 235 million guilders ($113.2 million), or 6.70 guilders a share, from 144 million guilders, or 4.10 guilders a share, a year ago.
The 32% state-owned DSM had eight million guilders of extraordinary charges in the latest quarter, mainly to reflect one-time losses in connection with the disposal of some operations.
The charges were offset in part by a gain from the sale of the company's construction division.
Last year, DSM had 71 million guilders of extraordinary charges for the restructuring program and other transactions.
The earnings growth also was fueled by the company's ability to cut net financing spending by half to around 15 million guilders.
Also, substantially lower Dutch corporate tax rates helped the company keep its tax outlay flat relative to earnings growth, the company added.
Sales, however, were little changed at 2.46 billion guilders, compared with 2.42 billion guilders.
Allergan Inc. said it received Food and Drug Administration approval to sell the PhacoFlex intraocular lens, the first foldable silicone lens available for cataract surgery.
The len's foldability enables it to be inserted in smaller incisions than are now possible for cataract surgery, the eye care and skin care concern said.
Cataracts refer to a clouding of the eye's natural lens.
A man from the Bush administration came before the House Agriculture Committee yesterday to talk about the U.S.'s intention to send some $100 million in food aid to Poland, with more to come from the EC.
The committee's members are worried what all this free food might do to the economic prospects of Poland's own farmers.
Rep. Gary Ackerman noted that past food aid had harmed farmers in El Salvador and Egypt.
However well intentioned, food transfers have the habit of growing larger and wrecking the market incentives for the recipient country's own farmers.
The First World has for some time had the bad habit of smothering other people's economies with this kind of unfocused kindness.
It should be constantly stressed that Poland's farmers mostly need a real market for their products.
Elco Industries Inc. said it expects net income in the year ending June 30, 1990, to fall below a recent analyst's estimate of $1.65 a share.
The Rockford, Ill., maker of fasteners also said it expects to post sales in the current fiscal year that are "slightly above" fiscal 1989 sales of $155 million.
The company said its industrial unit continues to face margin pressures and lower demand.
In fiscal 1989, Elco earned $7.8 million, or $1.65 a share.
The company's stock fell $1.125 to $13.625 in over-the-counter trading yesterday.
Oshkosh Truck Corp., Oshkosh, Wis., estimated earnings for its fourth quarter ended Sept. 30 fell 50% to 75% below the year-earlier $4.5 million, or 51 cents a share.
The truck maker said the significant drop in net income will result in lower earnings for the fiscal year.
In fiscal 1988, the company earned $17.3 million, or $1.92 a share, on revenue of $352.9 million.
Oshkosh Truck attributed the downturn in its earnings to higher start-up costs of its new chassis division, a softer motor-home market and higher administrative costs of compliance with government contractor regulations.
The company said it is in the process of phasing out John Deere, its current source of production for midsized motor home chassis.
In anticipation of the start-up of its new factory, the company said a larger-than-normal chassis supply has been built to carry it through the transition period.
Tokyo stocks edged up Wednesday in relatively active but unfocused trading.
London shares finished moderately higher.
At Tokyo, the Nikkei index of 225 selected issues, which gained 132 points Tuesday, added 14.99 points to 35564.43.
In early trading in Tokyo Thursday, the Nikkei index fell 63.79 points to 35500.64.
Wednesday's volume on the First Section was estimated at 900 million shares, in line with Tuesday's 909 million.
Declining issues slightly outnumbered advancing issues, 454 to 451.
Investors switched trading focus quickly as they did Tuesday, reflecting uncertainty about long-term commitments to any issue or sector, traders said.
Speculation, on the other hand, sparked buying in certain incentive-backed issues, though rumors underlying such shares eventually proved untrue.
The development, traders said, showed that there is more than ample liquidity available for investment despite the market's recent directionless trend.
Dealers led the market Wednesday by actively trading for their own accounts, observers said.
Institutions mostly remained on the sidelines because of uncertainty regarding interest rates and the dollar.
The Tokyo Stock Price Index (Topix) of all issues listed in the First Section, which gained 16.05 points Tuesday, was down 1.46 points, or 0.05%, at 2691.19.
The Second Section index, which added 6.84 points Tuesday, was up 5.92 points, or 0.16%, to close at 3648.82.
Volume in the second section was estimated at 18 million shares, up from 14 million Tuesday.
Akio Yamamoto, managing director of Nomura Investment Trust Management, said that if the U.S. federal funds rate declines to around 8.5%, institutions would acquire a clearer idea regarding the direction of the market and thus more comfortably participate in active buying.
Tokyu Group, Mitsubishi Estate and Bridgestone/Firestone, which advanced Tuesday, declined on profit-taking.
Wednesday's dominant issue was Yasuda Fire & Marine Insurance, which continued to surge on rumors of speculative buying.
It ended the day up 80 yen (56 cents) to 1,880 yen ($13.15).
Due to continuingly high gold prices tied to uncertainty about the U.S. currency, investor interest was directed toward oil and mining shares, which traders called a "defensive" action frequently taken when the dollar is expected to fall or during times of inflation.
Teikoku Oil, also stimulated by rumors of speculative buying, advanced 100 yen to 1,460.
Showa Shell gained 20 to 1,570 and Mitsubishi Oil rose 50 to 1,500.
Sumitomo Metal Mining fell five yen to 692 and Nippon Mining added 15 to 960.
Among other winners Wednesday was Nippon Shokubai, which was up 80 at 2,410.
Marubeni advanced 11 to 890.
London share prices were bolstered largely by continued gains on Wall Street and technical factors affecting demand for London's blue-chip stocks.
The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed 17.5 points higher at 2160.1.
It rose largely throughout the session after posting an intraday low of 2141.7 in the first 40 minutes of trading.
The index ended the day near its session high of 2163.2, which was posted within the last half-hour of trading.
Dealers said most investor interest was focused on defensive blue-chip stocks, particularly those with limited U.K. exposure.
Also, several key blue chips were pushed higher in thin volume because of a technical squeeze among market makers.
Sterling's firm tone, combined with a steady opening on Wall Street, also tempted some investors to come back to the market, dealers said.
There were concerns early in the day that Wall Street's sharp gains on Tuesday were overdone and due for a reversal.
The FT 30-share index settled 16.7 points higher at 1738.1.
Volume was 372.9 million shares, up from 334.5 million on Tuesday.
Dealers said institutions were still largely hugging the sidelines on fears that the market's recent technical rally might prove fragile.
They cited Wall Street's recent volatility and the lack of a clear indication over the market's short-term direction as factors in the institutional caution.
Jaguar, a U.K. luxury auto maker being pursued by Ford Motor and General Motors, gained 10 pence (16 cents) a share to close at 879 pence ($13.90).
It shed about 7 pence, however, after dealers said the market was disappointed that Ford didn't move to tender a bid for control of the company.
Dealers said the U.K. government's decision Tuesday to waive its protective "golden share" in the auto maker raised prospects of a bidding war between the two U.S. auto giants.
But the waiver also was seen as a signal that Ford, a major U.K. auto industry employer, was able to gain government acceptance of its bid for control of Jaguar.
Dealers said that interpretation sparked expectations of an imminent bid by Ford.
B.A.T Industries, which is being pursued by Sir James Goldsmith's Hoylake Investments, rose 9 to 753 on speculation that Hoylake will sweeten its bid, dealers said.
Like Jaguar, B.A.T also eased off its highs in afternoon dealings.
Reed International, a U.K. publishing group, gained 15 to 397 despite reporting a 3.7% drop in interim pretax profit.
Analysts said the fall in pretax profit was due to the group's recent restructuring and sale of peripheral units, and that its remaining businesses are performing well.
Dealers said the market agreed.
Stocks boosted by market-makers shopping to cover book requirements in FT-SE 100 shares included Carlton Communications, which climbed 32 to 778.
Drug companies in the key index also notched gains as market-makers searched for stock in anticipation of demand due to the sector's defensive qualities.
Wellcome gained 18 to 666 on a modest 1.1 million shares.
Glaxo, the U.K.'s largest pharmaceutical concern, advanced 23 to # 14.13.

Criminal charges were filed against Diceon Electronics Inc. and two company officials alleging waste disposal violations in its Chatsworth, Calif., facility.
The Los Angeles County district attorney's office filed seven felony and five misdemeanor counts charging that late last year and early this year the Irvine, Calif.-based circuit-board manufacturer illegally disposed of acid, caustic and heavy metals into the sewer system, and stored hazardous materials in leaky, unlabeled or open-top containers.
Named as defendants were Roland Matthews, president, and Peter Jonas, executive vice president and chief financial officer, as well as a former plant manager.
The company said local authorities held hearings on the allegations last spring and had returned the plant to "routine inspection" in August.
"The company does not feel that it or any of the individuals violated any criminal statute and the company expects full vindication in court."
Arraignments are scheduled for Nov. 14.
Consumer confidence stayed strong in October, despite the unsettling gyrations of the stock market.
"The sharp stock market decline in late October appears to have had little or no effect on consumers," said Fabian Linden, executive director of the Conference Board's consumer research center.
"Survey returns received after the drop in the Dow Jones average were about the same as the views expressed prior to that event."
The nonprofit, industry-supported group said its Consumer Confidence Index was 116.4 in October, barely changed from a revised 116.3 in September.
The index was 116.9 in October 1988 and in the past year has ranged from a low of 112.9 to a high of 120.7.
It uses a base of 100 in 1985.
In October, more people said that present business conditions were "good" than in September.
An equal number in each month said that employment conditions were good.
And 19.6% of consumers contacted believed business conditions will improve in the coming six months, compared with 18.3% in September.
Also, more people said conditions will worsen in the period.
In October 1988, 21.1% said business conditions would improve.
In October 1989, 16.9% said more jobs will be created in the coming six months, compared with 17.4% in September and 18.6% in October 1988.
Only 26.8% in October, compared with 28.5% in September and 26.8% in October 1988, said income would increase.
"The sustained level of confidence can be attributed to the continued favorable circumstances which affect the consumer's day-to-day economic life," said Mr. Linden.
"Unemployment continues at a relatively low level, providing a sense of job security, and a low inflation rate has kept the purchasing power of the weekly paycheck reasonably strong."
The consumer confidence survey, covering 5,000 U.S. households, is conducted in the first two weeks of each month for the Conference Board by National Family Opinion Inc., a Toledo, Ohio, market researcher.
Buying plans were mixed in October, with fewer households indicating plans to buy cars and more saying they will buy homes and appliances in the coming six months.
In October, 6.7% of respondents said they will buy a car, easing from September when 8.1% anticipated a purchase.
In October 1988, 7.3% said they would buy a car.
Home purchase plans increased to 3.3% from 3.1% in the two recent months.
In October 1988, 3.7% said they would buy a house.
In 1989, home purchase plans have ranged monthly from 2.9% to 3.7% of respondents.
In October, 30.6% said they will buy appliances in the coming six months, compared with 27.4% in September and 26.5% in October 1988.
Despite a deluge of economic news, the Treasury market remained quiet but the corporate market was abuzz over International Business Machines Corp.'s huge debt offering.
"There were so many economic reports but the market didn't care about any of them," said Kathleen Camilli, a money market economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
"So the focus turned to other fixed-income markets, corporate and mortgages in particular," she said.
IBM, the giant computer maker, offered $750 million of non-callable 30-year debentures priced to yield 8.47%, or about 1/2 percentage point higher than the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds.
The size of IBM's issue was increased from an originally planned $500 million as money managers and investors scrambled to buy the bonds.
In the investment-grade corporate market, "it's rare that you get an opportunity to buy a name that has such broad appeal and has such attractive call features," said James Ednie, a Drexel industrial bond trader.
Money managers ranked IBM's offering as the most significant investment-grade sale of the year because large issues of long-term debt by companies with triple-A credit are infrequent.
Syndicate officials at lead underwriter Salomon Brothers Inc. said the debentures were snapped by up pension funds, banks, insurance companies and other institutional investors.
In the Treasury market, investors paid scant attention to the day's economic reports, which for the most part provided a mixed view of the economy.
"Whether you thought the economy was growing weak or holding steady, yesterday's economic indicators didn't change your opinion," said Charles Lieberman, a managing director at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp.
The government reported that orders for manufactured goods were essentially unchanged in September while construction spending was slightly lower.
Both indicators were viewed as signs that the nation's industrial sector is growing very slowly, if at all.
A survey by the Federal Reserve's 12 district banks and the latest report by the National Association of Purchasing Management blurred that picture of the economy.
In a monthly report prepared for use at the Fed's next Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Nov. 14., the nation's central bank found that price increases have moderated and economic activity has grown at a sluggish pace in recent weeks.
Among other things, the survey found that manufacturing activity varied considerably across districts and among industries.
The Philadelphia and Cleveland districts, for example, reported declines in manufacturing activity while the Boston, Dallas and San Francisco banks noted that business expanded.
The purchasing managers index of economic activity rose in October, although it remains below 50%.
A reading below 50% indicates that the manufacturing sector is slowing while a reading above 50% suggests that the industry is expanding.
Mr. Lieberman said the diverse showing in yesterday's reports "only enhances the importance of the employment data."
The employment report, which at times has caused wide swings in bond prices, is due out tomorrow.
The average estimate of 22 economists polled by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report was that non-farm payrolls expanded by 152,000 in October.
The economists forecast a 0.1% rise in the unemployment rate to 5.4%.
In a surprise announcement, the Treasury said it will reopen the outstanding benchmark 30-year bond rather than create a new one for next week's quarterly refunding of the federal debt.
The Treasury will raise $10 billion in fresh cash by selling $30 billion of securities, including $10 billion of new three-year notes and $10 billion of new 10-year notes.
But rather than sell new 30-year bonds, the Treasury will issue $10 billion of 29year, nine-month bonds -- essentially increasing the size of the current benchmark 30-year bond that was sold at the previous refunding in August.
Credit market analysts said the decision to reopen the current benchmark, the 8 1/8% bond due August 2019, is unusual because the issue trades at a premium to its face amount.
Some dealers said the Treasury's intent is to help government bond dealers gauge investor demand for the securities, given uncertainties about when the auction will occur.
The Treasury said the refunding is contingent upon congressional and presidential passage of an increase in the federal debt ceiling.
Until such action takes places, the Treasury has no ability to issue new debt of any kind.
Meanwhile, Treasury bonds ended modestly higher in quiet trading.
The benchmark 30-year bond about 1/4 point, or $2.50 for each $1,000 face amount.
The benchmark was priced at 102 22/32 to yield 7.88% compared with 102 12/32 to yield 7.90% Tuesday.
The latest 10-year notes were quoted at 100 22/32 to yield 7.88% compared with 100 16/32 to yield 7.90%.
The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills was essentially unchanged at 7.79%, while the rate on six-month bills was slightly lower at 7.52% compared with 7.60% Tuesday.
IBM's $750 million debenture offering dominated activity in the corporate debt market.
Meanwhile, most investment-grade bonds ended unchanged to as much as 1/8 point higher.
In its latest compilation of performance statistics, Moody's Investors Service found that investment-grade bonds posted a total return of 2.7% in October while junk bonds showed a negative return of 1.5%.
Moody's said those returns compare with a 3.8% total return for longer-term Treasury notes and bonds.
Total return measures price changes and interest income.
For the year to date, Moody's said total returns were topped by the 16.5% of longer-term Treasury issues, closely followed by 15% for investment-grade bonds.
Junk bonds trailed the group again.
"Even the 7.2% return from the risk-free three-month Treasury bill has easily outdistanced the 4.1% return from junk bonds," wrote Moody's economist John Lonski in yesterday's market report.
"Little wonder that buyers for junk have been found wanting," he said.
Moody's said the average net asset value of 24 junk-bond mutual funds fell by 4.2% in October.
Mortgage securities ended slightly higher but trailed gains in the Treasury market.
Ginnie Mae's 9% issue for November delivery finished at 98 5/8, up 2/32, and its 9 1/2% issue at 100 22/32, also up 2/32.
The Ginnie Mae 9% securities were yielding 9.32% to a 12-year average life.
Activity was light in derivative markets, with no new issues priced.
Municipal bonds were mostly unchanged to up 1/8 point in light, cautious trading prior to tomorrow's unemployment report.
A $114 million issue of health facility revenue bonds from the California Health Facilities Financing Authority was temporarily withdrawn after being tentatively priced by a First Boston Corp. group.
An official for the lead underwriter declined to comment on the reason for the delay, but market participants speculated that a number of factors, including a lack of investor interest, were responsible.
The issue could be relaunched, possibly in a restructured form, as early as next week, according to the lead underwriter.
A $107.03 million offering of Santa Ana Community Redevelopment Agency, Calif., tax allocation bonds got off to a slow start and may be repriced at lower levels today, according to an official with lead underwriter Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp.
Bucking the market trend, an issue of $130 million general obligation distributable state aid bonds from Detroit, Mich., apparently drew solid investor interest.
West German dealers said there was little interest in Treasury bonds ahead of Thursday's new government bond issue.
So far, they said, investors appear unenthusiastic about the new issue which might force the government to raise the coupon to more than 7%.
It is generally expected to be the usual 10-year, four billion mark issue.
Rumors to the contrary have been that it would be a six billion mark issue, or that the last Bund, a 7% issue due October 1999, would be increased by two billion marks.
-- In Japan, the benchmark No. 111 4.6% issue due 1998 ended on brokers screens unchanged at 95.09 to yield 5.435%.
-- In Britain, the benchmark 11 3/4% bond due 2003/2007 fell 14/32 to 111 2/32 to yield 10.19%.
The 12% notes due 1995 fell 9/32 to 103 3/8 to yield 11.10%.
Standard & Poor's Corp. lowered to double-C from triple-C the rating on about $130 million of debt.
The rating concern said the textile and clothing company's interest expense exceeds operating profit "by a wide margin" and it noted United's estimated after-tax loss of $24 million for the year ended June 30.
Travelers Corp.'s third-quarter net income rose 11%, even though claims stemming from Hurricane Hugo reduced results $40 million.
Net advanced to $94.2 million, or 89 cents a share, from $85 million, or 83 cents a share, including net realized investment gains of $31 million, up from $10 million a year ago.
But revenue declined to $3 billion from $3.2 billion.
Travelers estimated that the California earthquake last month will result in a fourth-quarter pre-tax charge of less than $10 million.
The insurer's earnings from commercial property/casualty lines fell 59% in the latest quarter, while it lost $7.2 million in its personal property/casualty business, compared with earnings of $6.1 million a year ago.
Travelers's employee benefits group, which includes its group health insurance operations, posted earnings of $24 million, compared with a loss of $3 million last year.
In the first nine months, net was $306 million, compared with a loss of $195 million in the 1988 period.
The year-ago results included a $415 million charge in the 1988 second quarter for underperforming real estate and mortgage loans.
The British Department of Trade and Industry ordered an investigation of the competitive impact of Michelin Tyre PLC's planned acquisition of National Tyre Service Ltd.
The department said it referred the takeover to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission because of the purchase's possible effects on the U.K. market for distribution of replacement tires.
BTR PLC, a U.K. industrial conglomerate, said in June it had sold its National Tyre Service business to Michelin Investment Ltd., a U.K. unit of the tire maker, for # 140 million ($221.4 million).
Michelin Tyre is a unit of France's Michelin S.A.
Michelin officials couldn't immediately comment on the referral, but they noted the purchase from BTR has already been concluded.
National Tyre, which has 420 branches throughout the U.K., had 1988 pretax profit of # 8.5 million.
Rep. John Dingell, an important sponsor of President Bush's clean-air bill, plans to unveil a surprise proposal that would break with the White House on a centerpiece issue: acid rain.
The Michigan Democrat's proposal, which is expected today, is described by government sources and lobbyists as significantly weaker than the Bush administration's plan to cut utility emissions that lead to acid rain.
The administration's plan could cost utilities, mainly those that use coal, up to $4 billion a year.
The proposal comes as a surprise even to administration officials and temporarily throws into chaos the House's work on clean-air legislation.
As chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Mr. Dingell has almost single-handed control over clean-air legislation.
People close to the utility industry said Mr. Dingell's proposal appears to guarantee only an estimated seven-million-ton cut in annual sulfur-dioxide emissions that lead to acid rain, though additional cuts could be ordered later.
Mr. Bush's legislative package promises to cut emissions by 10 million tons -- basically in half -- by the year 2000.
Although final details weren't available, sources said the Dingell plan would abandon the president's proposal for a cap on utilities' sulfur-dioxide emissions.
That proposal had been hailed by environmentalists but despised by utilities because they feared it would limit their growth.
It also would junk an innovative market-based system for trading emissions credits among polluters.
In addition, it is believed to offer a cost-sharing mechanism that would help subsidize the clean-up costs for the dirtiest coal-fired utilities in the country, sparing their customers from exorbitant jumps in their electric bills.
The administration, sticking to its vow of avoiding tax increases, has staunchly opposed cost-sharing.
Mr. Dingell's staff was expected to present its acid-rain alternative to other committee members, apparently in an attempt to appease Midwestern lawmakers from high-polluting states who insist on cost-sharing.
It isn't clear, however, whether support for the proposal will be broad enough to pose a serious challenge to the White House's acid-rain plan.
While the new proposal might appeal to the dirtiest utilities, it might not win the support of utilities, many in the West, that already have added expensive cleanup equipment or burn cleaner-burning fuels.
Lawmakers representing some of the cleaner utilities have been quietly working with the White House to devise ways to tinker with the administration bill to address their acid-rain concerns.
American City Business Journals Inc. said its president, Michael K. Russell, will resign rather than relocate to new headquarters in Charlotte, N.C.
Mr. Russell, who co-founded the Kansas City, Mo.-based local business publications concern here, said he would have a five-year consulting agreement with the company, which recently underwent an ownership change.
Earlier this year Shaw Publishing Inc., Charlotte, acquired 30% of American City and has an agreement to acquire a further 25% from E.W. Scripps Co. next year.
Ray Shaw, chairman of American City, said he would assume Mr. Russell's responsibilities if a successor isn't found this month.
A nickname for measures to stop the market from plunging too far too fast.
Several moves were taken following the October 1987 crash to coordinate -- and sometimes deliberately disconnect -- the stock and futures markets in times of heightened volatility.
On the Big Board, a "side car" is put into effect when the S&P futures rise or fall 12 points.
The side car routes program trades into a special computer file that scans for imbalances of buy and sell orders.
On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, S&P 500 futures are not allowed to fall further than 12 points from the previous day's close for half an hour.
If, when trading resumes, the S&P futures fall 30 points from the previous day's close, a one-hour trading halt takes effect.
Also, the reforms allow the Big Board to halt trading for one hour if the Dow Jones Industrial Average falls 250 points, and for two more hours if the Dow slides an additional 150 points on the same day.
DOT System -- The "Designated Order Turnaround" System was launched by the New York Stock Exchange in March 1976, to offer automatic, high-speed order processing.
A faster version, the SuperDot, was launched in 1984.
Used by program traders and others to zip orders into the exchange, SuperDot handles about 80% of all orders entered at the exchange.
Futures Contracts -- Obligations to buy (for those who have purchased a contract) or deliver (for those who sold one) a quantity of the underlying commodity or financial instrument at the agreed-upon price by a certain date.
Most contracts are simply nullified by an opposite trade before they come due.
Indexing -- Many investors, mainly institutions, follow an investment strategy of buying and holding a mix of stocks to match the performance of a broad stock-market barometer such as the S&P 500.
Many institutional index funds are active program traders, swapping their stocks for futures when profitable to do so.
Program trading -- A wide range of computer-assisted portfolio trading strategies involving the simultaneous purchase or sale of 15 or more stocks.
Quant -- Generally, any Wall Street analyst who employs quantitive research techniques.
The newest breed, also called "rocket scientists" because of their backgrounds in physics and mathematics, devise the complex hedging and trading strategies that are popularly known as program trading.
Stock-index arbitrage -- Buying or selling baskets of stocks while at the same time executing offsetting trades in stock-index futures or options.
Traders profit by trying to capture fleeting price discrepancies between stocks and the index futures or options.
If stocks are temporarily "cheaper" than futures, for example, an arbitrager will buy stocks and sell futures.
Stock-index futures -- Contracts to buy or sell the cash value of a stock index by a certain date.
The cash value is determined by multiplying the index number by a specified amount.
The most common program-trading vehicles are futures contracts on Standard & poor's 500-stock index (traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange); the Major Market Index, a 20-stock index that mimics the Dow Jones Industrial Average (traded on the chicago Board of Trade); and the S&P 100 options (traded on the Chicago Board Options Exchange, and based on 100 stocks selected from the S&P 500).
Stock-index options -- Options give holders the right, but not the obligation, to buy (a call) or sell (a put) a specified amount of an underlying investment by a certin date at a preset price, known as the strike price.
For stock indexes, the underlying investment may be a stock-index futures contract or the cash value of a stock index.
For example, there are options on the S&P 500 futures contract and on the S&P 100 index.
Uptick -- An expression signifying that a transaction in a listed security occurred at a higher price than the previous transaction in that security.
New York financier Saul Steinberg sought federal permission to buy more than 15% of United Airlines' parent, UAL Corp., saying he might seek control of the nation's second-largest airline.
Although takeover experts said they doubted Mr. Steinberg will make a bid by himself, the application by his Reliance Group Holdings Inc. could signal his interest in helping revive a failed labor-management bid.
Such an application for federal antitrust clearance is necessary for any investor that might seek control.
But some investors have used such filings to boost the value of their stock holdings, which -- without buying more stock -- they then sold.
Takeover stock traders were puzzled by the Reliance filing and cautioned that it doesn't mean Mr. Steinberg will definitely seek control.
"Maybe he just wants to make something happen," said one takeover expert.
One investment banker said Mr. Steinberg may be trying to position himself as a friendly investor who could help UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf revive a failed labor-management bid.
Mr. Steinberg, he suggested, could replace British Airways PLC, which has withdrawn from the buy-out group.
Reliance had already bought and sold UAL stock at a big profit without making an antitrust filing before the collapse Oct. 13 of the $6.79 billion, $300-a-share labor-management buy-out.
Reliance acquired a 7% UAL stake early this year at an average cost of $110 a share, and reduced its stake to 4.7% after UAL accepted the bid at prices higher than $282 a share.
Market sources said Reliance has already sold its entire UAL stake, and thus wouldn't have any reason to file the application simply to boost the value of its stock.
But the exact amount of Reliance's current holding hasn't been formally disclosed.
The filing adds a new twist to market speculation that Coniston Partners, a New York money manager, has bought more than 5% of UAL stock and may challenge the UAL board's decision last week to remain independent.
Speculation about Coniston has caused the stock to rebound from a low of $145.
UAL's announcement came after the market closed yesterday.
In composite New York Stock Exchange trading, the shares closed at $177, up $1.50.
UAL wouldn't elaborate on a statement that it had been notified of the filing by Reliance.
Reliance confirmed the filing but wouldn't elaborate.
Some takeover experts were skeptical, saying it was possible that Mr. Steinberg made the filing only to help boost the value of any remaining Reliance stake in UAL.
Mr. Steinberg is thought to be on friendly terms with UAL's Mr. Wolf.
The investor was instrumental in tapping Mr. Wolf to run the air cargo unit of Tiger International Inc.
Mr. Wolf's success in that job helped him land the top job with UAL in December 1987.
But any potential acquirer must attempt to reach some kind of accord with the company's employees, primarily its pilots and the powerful machinists' union, which has opposed a takeover.
A.L. Williams Corp. was merged into Primerica Corp., New York, after a special meeting of Williams shareholders cleared the transaction, the companies said.
Primerica, which had owned nearly 70% of Williams, will pay about 16.7 million shares, currently valued at almost $472 million, for the rest of Williams.
The financial-services company will pay 0.82 share for each Williams share.
Williams shares, which were to be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange after the close of composite trading yesterday, closed at $23.25, off 12.5 cents.
Primerica closed at $28.25, down 50 cents.
Williams, Duluth, Ga., is an insurance and financial-services holding company.
Its subsidiaries' services are marketed by closely held A.L. Williams & Associates.
Primerica, as expected, also acquired certain assets of the agency and assumed certain of its liabilities.
Terms weren't disclosed.
Intelogic Trace Inc., San Antonio, Texas, said it bought 2.7 million shares, or about 18%, of its common stock from an unaffiliated shareholder for $3.625 a share, or $9.9 million.
The move boosts Intelogic Chairman Asher Edelman's stake to 20% from 16.2% and may help prevent Martin Ackerman from making a run at the computer-services concern.
Mr. Ackerman already is seeking to oust Mr. Edelman as chairman of Datapoint Corp., an Intelogic affiliate.
The action followed by one day an Intelogic announcement that it will retain an investment banker to explore alternatives "to maximize shareholder value," including the possible sale of the company.
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Intelogic shares rose 37.5 cents to close at $2.75.
Mr. Edelman declined to specify what prompted the recent moves, saying they are meant only to benefit shareholders when "the company is on a roll."
He added, "This has nothing to do with Marty Ackerman and it is not designed, particularly, to take the company private."
But Mr. Ackerman said the buy-back, and the above-market price paid, prove that Mr. Edelman is running scared.
Dow Jones & Co. said it extended its $18-a-share offer for Telerate Inc. common stock until 5 p.m. EST Nov. 9.
The offer, valued at about $576 million for the 33% of Telerate that Dow Jones doesn't already own, had been set to expire Nov. 6.
Dow Jones, which owns about 64 million of Telerate's 95 million common shares outstanding, said that about 24,000 shares have been tendered under its offer.
Telerate's two independent directors have rejected the offer as inadequate.
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Telerate shares closed at $19.50, up 12.5 cents.

Rockwell International Corp. reported flat operating earnings for the fourth quarter ended Sept. 30.
The aerospace, automotive supply, electronics and printing-press concern also indicated that the first half of fiscal 1990 could be rough.
In an interview, Donald Beall, chairman, said first-half profit certainly would trail the past year's, primarily because of weakness in the heavy-truck and passenger-car markets.
Still, he added, if the industrial sector remains relatively stable, Rockwell should be able to recover in the second half and about equal fiscal 1989's operating profit of $630.9 million.
For fiscal 1989's fourth quarter, Rockwell's net income totaled $126.1 million, or 50 cents a share.
That compares with operating earnings of $132.9 million, or 49 cents a share, the year earlier.
The prior-year period includes a one-time favorable tax adjustment on the B-1B bomber program and another gain from sale of the industrial sewing-machine business, which made net $185.9 million, or 70 cents a share.
Sales rose 4% to $3.28 billion from $3.16 billion.
Mr. Beall said that he was generally pleased with the latest numbers and cited a particularly strong showing by the company's electronics segment.
Overall, pretax electronics earnings soared 12% to $107.9 million from $96.4 million.
All four areas had higher revenue for the three months ended Sept. 30.
For the year, electronics emerged as Rockwell's largest sector in terms of sales and earnings, muscling out aerospace for the first time.
The graphics business, which also was singled out by the chairman as a positive, saw its operating earnings for the quarter jump 79% to $42.1 million from $23.5 million.
For the year, bolstered by the introduction of the Colorliner newspaper-printing press, graphics earnings almost doubled.
Aerospace earnings sagged 37% for the quarter and 15% for the year, largely due to lower B-1B program profit; the last of the bombers rolled out in April 1988.
That was partially offset by the resumption of space shuttle flights and increased demand for expendable launch-vehicle engines.
The company also took hits in the fourth quarters of 1989 and 1988 on a fixed-price weapons-modernization development program -- probably the C-130 gunship, according to analysts.
For fiscal 1989, the company posted net of $734.9 million, or $2.87 a share, down from $811.9 million, or $3.04 a share, in fiscal 1988.
Excluding one-time additions to profit in each year, earnings per share were $2.47, up 7.4% from $2.30 in fiscal 1988.
Sales for the year rose 5% to $12.52 billion from $11.95 billion in fiscal 1988.
Dell Computer Corp. said it cut prices on several of its personal computer lines by 5% to 17%.
The Austin, Texas-based company, which specializes in the direct sale of personal computers and accessories, said its price cuts include a $100 reduction on its System 210 computer with 512 kilobytes of memory, a 40-megabyte hard disk and a color monitor.
That package now sells for about $2,099.
A computer using the more-advanced Intel Corp. 386 microprocessor, with four megabytes of memory and a 100-megabyte hard disk now sells for $5,699, down from $6,799.
Personal computer prices for models using the Intel 286 and 386 microprocessors, which the Dell models use, generally have been coming down as chip prices have fallen.
World sugar futures prices soared on rumors that Brazil, a major grower and exporter, might not ship sugar this crop year and next.
Prices also were boosted by another rumor that Mexico, usually a large producer and exporter, might have to buy a large quantity of sugar.
Although traders rushed to buy futures contracts, many remained skeptical about the Brazilian development, which couldn't be confirmed, analysts said.
The March and May contracts rose to fresh life-of-contract highs of 14.54 cents and 14.28 cents at their best levels of the day.
The March delivery, which has no limits, settled at 14.53 cents, up 0.56 cent a pound.
The May contract, which also is without restraints, ended with a gain of 0.54 cent to 14.26 cents.
The July delivery rose its daily permissible limit of 0.50 cent a pound to 14.00 cents, while other contract months showed near-limit advances.
According to reports carried by various news services, the Brazilian government told its sugar producers that they won't be allowed to export sugar during the current 1989-90 season, which began May 1, and the 1990-91 season so that it can be used to produce alcohol for automobile fuel.
One analyst, Arthur Stevenson, of Prudential-Bache Securities, New York, estimated that 65% or more of Brazil's newly made automobiles run on alcohol and can't use gasoline.
"This is a demand that must be met, regardless of the price of oil," said Mr. Stevenson.
Brazil is the third-largest producer and the fifth-largest exporter of sugar in the world.
A shift to producing more alcohol and less sugar had been expected, but the latest news, if true, indicates a more drastic shift than had been anticipated.
During the current crop year, Brazil was expected to produce 6.9 million tons of sugar, a drop from 8.1 million tons in 1988-89.
"It is these 645,000 tons that are in question for this crop year," explained Judith Ganes, analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton, New York.
"Producers were granted the right earlier this year to ship sugar and the export licenses were expected to have begun to be issued" yesterday.
As a result, Ms. Ganes said, it is believed that little or no sugar from the 1989-90 crop has been shipped yet, even though the crop year is six months old.
More than a half of all sugar produced in Brazil goes for alcohol production, according to Ms. Ganes.
Also, there has been a switch in the past decade to planting of orange trees in areas that were previously used for cane, and this change is being felt now, she said.
Most important, Ms. Ganes noted, "Brazilian officials said that no decision has as yet been made on the suspension of exports."
Thomas Oxnard, sugar analyst for PaineWebber in Hackensack, N.J., said: "I am highly skeptical that Brazil will curtail sugar exports, particularly with the price of sugar at over 14 cents a pound."
Above all, Mr. Oxnard noted, the situation is extremely confused.
"Professional sugar people here who have strong contacts with the Brazilian sugar industry have been unable to confirm the reports or get enough information to clarify the situation," he said.
"It's the type of nervous atmosphere in which a report can be put out, such as the one saying exports will be suspended, and no one can confirm it."
Mr. Oxnard observed that the situation in Brazil is also very complicated.
On the one hand, Brazil started an ethanol program about 15 years ago to fuel a huge portion of its national fleet of cars and is now committed to this program.
"It has to weigh, on the other hand, the relatively high price of sugar it can earn on the export market in making decisions as to whether to produce sugar or alcohol," Mr. Oxnard said.
Mexico, which is normally a sugar exporter, has had production problems in the past two years, analysts said.
Last year, it had to buy sugar on the world market to meet export commitments, they noted.
This year it is expected to be a net importer and is said to be seeking to buy about 200,000 tons of sugar to meet internal needs, analysts said.
Petroleum futures were generally higher with heating oil leading the way.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, heating oil for December delivery increased 1.25 cents to settle at 60.36 cents a gallon.
Gasoline futures were mixed to unchanged.
But the strength in heating oil helped push up crude oil.
West Texas Intermediate crude for December delivery rose 13 cents a barrel to settle at $20.07.
The firmness in heating oil was attributed to colder weather in parts of the U.S. and to the latest weekly report by the American Petroleum Institute, which showed a decline in inventories of the fuel.
Prices closed mostly higher in relatively light trading as farmers continued to withhold their crops from the marketplace in the hope of higher prices to come.
Trading was muted in part because of the observance of All Saints' Day across much of Europe.
Continued export demand also supported prices.
As an indicator of the tight grain supply situation in the U.S., market analysts said that late Tuesday the Chinese government, which often buys U.S. grains in quantity, turned instead to Britain to buy 500,000 metric tons of wheat.
Traders said prices also were supported by widespread rumors that the Soviet Union is on the verge of receiving most favored nation status from the U.S..
That designation would, among other things, provide more generous credit terms under which the Soviets could purchase grain.
The Soviets are widely believed to need additional supplies, despite running up record one-month purchases of 310 million bushels of corn in October.
Futures prices rose, extending Tuesday's gains.
The December contract advanced 2.50 cents a pound to $1.1650.
Buying for the most part carried over from the previous session, and traders apparently ignored reports that a Chilean mine strike may have ended almost before it began, an analyst said.
According to news service reports, most workers at the Disputado mines owned by Exxon Corp. agreed to a new two-year wage contract that includes a 5% increase and other benefits.
However, some workers haven't yet accepted the new contract and are continuing negotiations, the analyst said.
Separately, Reuter reported that the Papua-New Guinea government urged its Parliament to extend a state of emergency in copper-rich Bougainville Island for two months.
The Bougainville copper mine has been inoperative since May 15 because of attacks by native landowners who want Bougainville to secede from Papua-New Guinea.
The parent of Younkers, after failing to find a buyer for the chain of Midwestern department stores, said it will sell a stake in the chain to management and take other steps to reduce its investment in retailing.
Equitable of Iowa Cos., Des Moines, had been seeking a buyer for the 36-store Younkers chain since June, when it announced its intention to free up capital to expand its insurance business.
But Equitable said it was unable to find a buyer willing to pay what it considers "fair value" for Younkers because of recent turmoil in the bond and stock markets and in retailing.
Younkers rang up sales in 1988 of $313 million.
It operates stores mostly in Iowa and Nebraska.
Younkers management is likely to buy a 10% to 20% interest in the chain in January, said Fred S. Hubbell, Equitable's president and chief executive officer.
He said Equitable hopes to eventually reduce its stake in Younkers to less than 50%.
Tony Lama Co. said that Equus Investment II Limited Partnership has proposed changing the offer for the company to $13.65 in cash and stock from an all-cash transaction.
Under terms of the new proposal, Equus, managed by Equus Capital Corp., Houston, would pay $12 cash and one new preferred share with a liquidation preference of $1.65 a share for each of Tony Lama's 2.1 million shares outstanding.
Previously, it offered $13.65 a share in cash, or $29 million.
The El Paso, Texas, maker of Western boots and leather accessories said the preferred stock would accrue dividends at a 12% rate, but wouldn't be paid for the first two years.
The stock would be redeemed in five years, subject to terms of the surviving company's debt.
Neither Equus nor Tony Lama gave a reason for the changed offer and Tony Lama couldn't be reached for comment.
However, Tony Lama said it would promptly submit the offer to a special committee of the company's board.
Reuters Holdings PLC said Michael Reupke resigned as general manager to pursue unspecified interests, a move the news organization termed an "amicable separation."
Mr. Reupke, 52 years old and a 27-year Reuters veteran, had been the information-services company's general manager for only six months.
His appointment to that post, which has senior administrative, staff and policy responsibilities, followed a several-year tenure as Reuters's editor in chief.
No successor was named, and Mr. Reupke's duties will be split among three other senior Reuters executives, the company said.
In a telephone interview, Mr. Reupke said his departure was for "personal reasons," which he declined to specify.
"There is no business reason for my departure," nor any disagreement over policy, he added.
He also rejected reports that his departure stemmed from disappointment the general manager's post hadn't also led to a board directorship at the London-based news organization.
Mr. Reupke was one of three executives on Reuters's eight-person executive committee who didn't also serve on the company's board of directors.
"If I were choosing the people of tomorrow, I would have chosen the people who are now on the board," he said.
A Reuters spokesman said the departure reflects "no change in strategy or profits."
Mark Shepperd, an analyst at UBS Phillips & Drew in London, said, "I suspect (the departure) will be fairly irrelevant for the company.
I would be very surprised if his departure signals any change in strategy or change in profit expectations."
On London's Stock Exchange, Reuters shares rose five pence to 913 pence ($14.43).
In the U.S. over-the-counter market, American depositary shares for Reuters, each representing three shares in the London market, closed unchanged at $43.875.
The senior of the three executives who will assume Mr. Reupke's duties is Nigel Judah, 58, finance director and a Reuters board director.
Peter Holland, 45, deputy general manager, becomes director of corporate affairs.
And Patrick Mannix, 46, international technical manager, becomes director of group quality programs.
DD Acquisition Corp., a partnership of Unicorp Canada Corp.'s Kingsbridge Capital Group and Cara Operations Ltd., extended to Nov. 20 its $45-a-share offer for all Dunkin' Donuts Inc. shares outstanding.
The offer, which was due to expire yesterday, is conditional on 50.1% of Dunkin' common shares, on a fully diluted basis, being tendered and on the withdrawal of the company's poison pill rights plan.
DD Acquisition has launched a suit in a Delaware court seeking the withdrawal of Dunkin's poison pill rights and employee stock ownership plans, which it claims were put in place to deter bidders.
DD Acquisition said 2.2 million shares, or about 38.5% of the shares outstanding, have been tendered under its offer.
The partners said they already hold 15% of all shares outstanding.
Dunkin' has set Nov. 10 as the deadline for the receipt of any competing bids.
DD Acquisition said the extension is to allow this process to be completed.
Dunkin' is based in Randolph, Mass.
Cara, a food services chain operator and Unicorp, a holding company, are based in Toronto.
Savin Corp. reported a third-quarter net loss of $35.2 million, or 31 cents a share, compared with year-earlier profit of $3.8 million, or one cent a share.
A spokesman for the Stamford, Conn.based company said operations had a loss of $5.5 million for the quarter; in addition, the loss was magnified by nonrecurring charges totaling $23.5 million and $8.2 million in asset-valuation adjustments that he described as "unusual."
The charges were partly offset by a $2 million gain on the sale of investments of two joint ventures, he said.
Revenue declined 8% to $85.7 million, from $93.3 million a year earlier.
Savin cited "a general softening in the demand for office products in the market segments in which Savin competes.
Hadson Corp. said it expects to report a third-quarter net loss of $17 million to $19 million because of special reserves and continued low natural-gas prices.
The Oklahoma City energy and defense concern said it will record a $7.5 million reserve for its defense group, including a $4.7 million charge related to problems under a fixed-price development contract and $2.8 million in overhead costs that won't be reimbursed.
In addition, Hadson said it will write off about $3.5 million in costs related to international exploration leases where exploration efforts have been unsuccessful.
The company also cited interest costs and amortization of goodwill as factors in the loss.
A year earlier, net income was $2.1 million, or six cents a share, on revenue of $169.9 million.
A lack of enthusiasm with the latest economic data hampered the stock market's bid to extend Tuesday's sharp gains, as prices closed slightly higher in sluggish trading.
While renewed optimism about the outlook for takeover activity boosted several so-called deal stocks, traders said profit-taking weighed on the market, with blue-chips bearing the brunt of the selling.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had jumped 41.60 points on Tuesday, drifted on either side of its previous close and finished with a gain of just 0.82 at 2645.90.
Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index added 0.84 to 341.20; the rise was equivalent to a gain of about six points in the industrial average.
The Dow Jones Equity Market Index gained 0.99 to 319.75 and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index went up 0.60 to 188.84.
Advancing stocks led decliners on the New York Stock Exchange by 847 to 644.
Big Board volume amounted to 154,240,000 shares, down from 176.1 million Tuesday.
The October survey of corporate purchasing managers, as expected, provided evidence that economic growth remains subdued.
An index of economic activity drawn from the survey stood last month at 47.6%; a reading above 50% would have indicated that the manufacturing sector was improving.
But with the index proving somewhat better than expected and the widely anticipated report on October employment scheduled to arrive tomorrow, stock prices firmed only modestly in response to the report and then faltered.
"This market's still going through its pains," said Philip Puccio, head of equity trading at Prudential-Bache Securities.
Uncertainty about the prospects for further action to curtail stock-index arbitrage, a form of program trading blamed for recent volatility in the market, also contributed to its lack of direction, Mr. Puccio said.
Arbitrage-related trading during the session was confined largely to a round of buy programs near the close, which helped offset the impact of profit-taking among blue chips.
Trading is expected to remain subdued as the market awaits tomorrow's release of the jobs data with the hope that it will point toward a decline in interest rates.
Campbell Soup jumped 3 3/8 to 47 1/8 as the resignation of R. Gordon McGovern as president and chief executive officer sparked a revival of rumors that the company could become a takeover target.
Prudential-Bache Securities boosted the stock's short-term investment rating in response to the departure; analyst John McMillin said he believes the company will turn to new management "that's more financially oriented."
Other rumored takeover and restructuring candidates to attract buyers included Woolworth, which went up 1 3/4 to 59 1/2; Avon Products, up 1 3/4 to 29 1/4; Paramount Communications, up 2 to 57 7/8, and Ferro, up 2 5/8 to 28 3/4.

Texaco rose 3/4 to 53 3/8 as 4.4 million shares changed hands.
Most of the volume came from trades designed to capture the stock's next dividend; Texaco has a yield of 5.6% and goes ex-dividend today.
Santa Fe Pacific dropped 1 1/8 to 17 3/4.
The company's proposal to sell a 20% stake in its real-estate unit for around $400 million has caused analysts to consider whether to cut their estimates of Santa Fe's asset value.

Freeport-McMoRan Inc. said it will convert its Freeport-McMoRan Energy Partners Ltd. partnership into a publicly traded company through the exchange of units of the partnership for common shares.
The company said the restructuring isn't expected to have any impact, adverse or otherwise, on its financial results.
Freeport-McMoRan, a New Orleans-based diversified energy conglomerate, said the partnership will exchange its assets for common shares of a yet-to-be-formed entity.
Freeport-McMoRan Energy Partners will be liquidated and shares of the new company distributed to the partnership's unitholders.
Unitholders will receive two additional 55 cents-a-unit distribution payments before the trust is liquidated in early 1990, the company said.
It is expected that common shares equal to the number of units outstanding -- about 108 million on Sept. 30 -- will be issued during the first quarter of 1990.
Freeport-McMoRan, the parent company, holds roughly 80% of the units outstanding.
Nissan Motor Co., Japan's second-largest car maker, announced Wednesday that the parent concern's pretax earnings in the first half ended last Sept. 30 rose 14% to 88.32 billion yen ($618.1 million) from 77.6 billion yen a year earlier.
Nissan cited strong domestic sales against the backdrop of continuous economic expansion.
Profit surged 42% to 40.21 billion yen, or 16.09 yen a share, from 28.36 billion yen, or 11.72 yen a share.
Sales totaled 1.916 trillion yen, climbing 17% from 1.637 trillion yen in the year-earlier period.
Nissan scheduled a seven-yen interim dividend payment, unchanged.
Atsushi Muramatsu, executive vice president and chief financial officer of Nissan, said, "The company has experienced a remarkable turnaround in terms of profitability since the fiscal year ending March 1987, when the sharp and rapid appreciation of the yen caused many difficulties.
"It can be said that the trend of financial improvement has been firmly set," he added.
Heritage Media Corp., New York, said it offered to buy the shares of POP Radio Corp. it doesn't already own in a stock swap.
Heritage, which owns 51% of POP's 3.6 million shares outstanding, said it will exchange one share of a new preferred stock for each POP common share it doesn't already own.
Depending upon how many warrants and options are exercised prior to completion of the transaction, Heritage would issue between 1.8 million and 2.35 million preferred shares, a Heritage spokesman estimated.
In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, POP plunged $4 to $14.75.
The preferred stock, which would have a dividend rate of $1.76 a year, would be convertible into Heritage common at a rate of four common shares for each preferred.
New York-based POP Radio provides, through a national, in-store network, a customized music, information and advertising service which simulates live radio.
Heritage owns and operates television and radio stations and in-store advertising and promotion programs.
GenCorp Inc., hurt by a plant accident and other unexpected costs, said it expects to report that fiscal fourth-quarter profit from continuing operations will be significantly below last year's $25 million.
The Fairlawn, Ohio-based company also said that full-year profit from continuing operations will be far below last year's $148 million.
Last year's figures include a one-time loss of $12 million for restructuring and unusual items.
But the automotive parts and aerospace concern expects that net for the year ending Nov. 30 will exceed last fiscal year's net of $70 million, or $2.19 a share, primarily because of $200 million in gains from sales of discontinued operations.
Harry Millis, an analyst at McDonald & Co. in Cleveland, said GenCorp's unanticipated losses come largely from an accident at a government-owned assembly plant in Kansas, run by a private subcontractor, that makes cluster bombs for GenCorp's Aerojet Ordnance business.
Transamerica Corp., San Francisco, said third-quarter profit was essentially flat despite a large one-time gain a year earlier.
The insurance and financial services concern said profit for the quarter rose 1.1% to $93.9 million, or $1.19 a share, compared with $92.9 million, or $1.18 a share, the year earlier.
The results reflected a 24% gain in income from its finance businesses, and a 15% slide in income from insurance operations.
Transamerica said third-quarter investment gains were $10.2 million, compared with $6.4 million the year earlier.
It said insurance profit reflected a $6 million loss from Hurricane Hugo.
It also estimated that losses from the Oct. 17 earthquake in California would be no more than $6 million, and would be included in fourth-quarter results.
RMS International Inc., Hasbrouk Heights, N.J., facing a cash-flow squeeze, said it is seeking other financing sources and waivers from debenture holders.
The company said that because of softening sales it isn't in compliance with requirements that it maintain $3 million in working capital.
RMS distributes electronic devices and produces power supplies and plastic literature displays.
RMS said it had a loss of $158,666, or 10 cents a share, in the third quarter, compared with a year-earlier loss of $26,956, or two cents a share.
Sales rose to $3 million from $2.9 million.
For the nine months, the company reported a net loss of $608,413, or 39 cents a share, compared with year-earlier net income of $967,809, or 62 cents a share.
Sales rose to $9.8 million from $8.9 million.
Meridian National Corp. said it sold 750,000 shares of its common stock to the McAlpine family interests, for $1 million, or $1.35 a share.
The sale represents 10.2% of Meridian's shares outstanding.
The McAlpine family, which operates a number of multinational companies, including a London-based engineering and construction company, also lent to Meridian National $500,000.
That amount is convertible into shares of Meridian common stock at $2 a share during its one-year term.
The loan may be extended by the McAlpine group for an additional year with an increase in the conversion price to $2.50 a share.
The sale of shares to the McAlpine family along with the recent sale of 750,000 shares of Meridian stock to Haden MacLellan Holding PLC of Surrey, England and a recent public offering have increased Meridian's net worth to $8.5 million, said William Feniger, chief executive officer of Toledo, Ohio-based Meridian.
Ratners Group PLC, a fast-growing, acquisition-minded London-based jeweler, raised its price for Seattle-based specialty jeweler Weisfield's Inc. to $57.50 a share, or $62.1 million, from $50 a share, or $55 million, after another concern said it would be prepared to outbid Ratners's initial offer.
The other concern wasn't identified.
Ratners's chairman, Gerald Ratner, said the deal remains of "substantial benefit to Ratners."
In London at mid-afternoon yesterday, Ratners's shares were up 2 pence (1.26 cents), at 260 pence ($1.64).
The sweetened offer has acceptances from more than 50% of Weisfield's shareholders, and it is scheduled for completion by Dec. 10.
The acquisition of 87-store Weisfield's raises Ratners's U.S. presence to 450 stores.
About 30% of Ratners's profit already is derived from the U.S..
Carnival Cruise Lines Inc. said potential problems with the construction of two big cruise ships from Finland have been averted.
Last week, Miami-based Carnival disclosed that Waertsilae Marine Industries, the Finnish shipyard that is building Carnival's new cruise ships, planned to file for bankruptcy.
Yesterday, Carnival said a new company has been formed in Finland that will carry on Waertsilae's shipbuilding operations.
Carnival said it will be an 11% shareholder in the new company.
Carnival said the Fantasy, a 2,050-passenger ship that was slated to be delivered this month, will be delivered in January.
A second ship is now expected to be delivered late next year or early in 1991.
Carnival had expected that ship to be delivered next fall.
A planned third ship still may be built in the Finnish shipyard, or may be built elsewhere, Carnival said.
Valley Federal Savings & Loan Association took an $89.9 million charge as it reported a third-quarter loss of $70.7 million, or $12.09 a share.
The Van Nuys, Calif., thrift had net income of $132,000, or three cents a share, a year ago.
The bulk of the pretax charge is a $62 million write-off of capitalized servicing at the mobile home financing subsidiary, which the company said had been a big drain on earnings.
The company said the one-time provision would substantially eliminate all future losses at the unit.
Valley Federal also added $18 million to realestate loan reserves and eliminated $9.9 million of good will.
The thrift said that "after these charges and assuming no dramatic fluctuation in interest rates, the association expects to achieve near record earnings in 1990."
Valley Federal is currently being examined by regulators.
New loans continue to slow; they were $6.6 million in the quarter compared with $361.8 million a year ago.
The thrift has assets of $3.2 billion.
First of America Bank Corp. said it completed its acquisition of Midwest Financial Group Inc. for about $250 million.
First of America, which now has 45 banks and $12.5 billion in assets, announced an agreement to acquire the Peoria, Ill., bank holding company in January.
Midwest Financial has $2.3 billion in assets and eight banks.
The Midwest Financial subsidiary banks will continue to operate under their current names until early 1990, when each will adopt the First of America name.
Kalamazoo, Mich.-based First of America said it will eliminate the 13 management positions of the former Midwest Financial parent company.
First of America said some of the managers will take other jobs with First of America.
But it said that severance payments to those executives not staying with the company will reduce First of America's operating results for 1989 by $3 million to $4 million, or 15 cents to 20 cents a share.
Coleco Industries Inc., a once high-flying toy maker whose stock peaked at $65 a share in the early 1980s, filed a Chapter 11 reorganization plan that provides just 1.125 cents a share for common stockholders.
Under the plan, unsecured creditors, who are owed about $430 million, would receive about $92 million, or 21 cents for each dollar they are owed.

Xerox Corp. has told employees in its Crum & Forster personal insurance operations that it is laying off about 300 people, or 25% of the staff.
A spokeswoman for Crum & Forster said employees were told early this week that numerous staff functions for the personal insurance lines were going to be centralized as a cost-cutting move.
She said the move would result in a after-tax charge of less than $4 million to be spread over the next three quarters.
By comparison, for the first nine months, Xerox earned $492 million, or $4.55 a share, on revenue of $12.97 billion.
Earnings at Xerox's financial-services operations actually rose slightly, but that was largely because capital gains at Crum & Forster offset Hurricane Hugo payments and the reserves set up to cover future payments.
Property/casualty insurance has been a tough business in recent quarters, as pricing has been cutthroat and natural disasters such as Hurricane Hugo and the California earthquake have resulted in huge payments.
Komatsu Ltd., a large integrated maker of construction machinery, posted a 32% unconsolidated gain in first-half pretax profit.
For the period ended Sept.30, it earned 16.68 billion yen, (US$ 116.7 million) up from 12.68 billion yen the year before.
Sales rose 11% to 292.32 billion yen from 263.07 billion yen.

Junk-bond markdowns, an ongoing Securities and Exchange Commission investigation, a Drexel Burnham Lambert connection, a fizzled buy-out rumor.
All this has cast a pall over Columbia Savings & Loan Association and its high-rolling 43-year-old chairman, Thomas Spiegel, who built the $12.7 billion Beverly Hills, Calif., thrift with high-yield junk bonds.
Bears have targeted Columbia's stock because of the thrift's exposure to the shaky junk market.
And some investors fault Mr. Spiegel's life style; he earns millions of dollars a year and flies around in Columbia's jet planes.
Columbia stock recently hit 4 1/8, after reaching 11 3/4 earlier this year on rumors that Mr. Spiegel would take the thrift private.
Moreover, junk professionals think Columbia's huge third-quarter markdown of its junk portfolio to $4.4 billion wasn't enough, meaning another markdown could be coming.
But in recent days, Columbia has edged up, closing at 5 1/4, up 3/8, yesterday on revived speculation that the thrift might restructure.
Mr. Spiegel's fans say Columbia's Southern California branches are highly salable, and the thrift has $458 million of shareholders equity underlying its assets.
That's almost $10 of equity for each Columbia share, including convertible preferred shares, though more junk markdowns would reduce the cushion.
Columbia has only about 10 million common shares in public hands.
The Spiegel family has 25% of the common and 75% of the votes.
Other big common holders are Carl Lindner's American Financial, investor Irwin Jacobs and Pacific Financial Research, though the latter cut its stake this summer.
While many problems would attend a restructuring of Columbia, investors say Mr. Spiegel is mulling such a plan to mitigate Columbia's junk problems.
Indeed, Columbia executives recently told reporters they were interested in creating a separate unit to hold Columbia's junk bonds and perhaps do merchant banking.
Columbia won't comment on all the speculation.
But like other thrifts, it's expected to seek regulators' consent to create a distinct junk-bond entity.
Plans to do this are due to be filed in a week or so.
New rules force thrifts to write down their junk to market value, then sell the bonds over five years.
That's why Columbia just wrote off $130 million of its junk and reserved $227 million for future junk losses.
But if Columbia could keep its junk bonds separate from the thrift till they mature -- at full value, unless the issuer goes bust or restructures -- the junk portfolio might do all right.
Columbia, a longtime Drexel client, won't provide current data on its junk.
But its 17 big junk holdings at year end showed only a few bonds that have been really battered.
These were Allied Stores, Western Union Telegraph, Gillett Holdings, SCI Television and Texas Air, though many other bonds in Columbia's portfolio also have lost value.
Possibly offsetting that, Columbia recently estimated it has unrealized gains on publicly traded equity investments of more than $70 million.
It also hopes for ultimate gains of as much as $300 million on equity investments in buy-outs and restructurings.
One trial balloon Mr. Spiegel is said to have floated to investors: Columbia might be broken up, as Mellon Bank was split into a good bank and a bad bank.
But Columbia's good bank would be a regulated thrift, while the bad bank would be a private investment company, holding some of Columbia's junk bonds, real estate and equity investments.
Some think Columbia's thrift, which now is seeking a new chief operating officer, might be capitalized at, say $300 million, and shopped to a commercial bank that wants a California presence.
The thrift surely could be sold for more than the value of its equity, financial industry executives say.
Meanwhile, the bad bank with the junk bonds -- and some capital -- might be spun off to Columbia shareholders, including Mr. Spiegel, who might then have a new career, investors say.
It isn't clear how much a restructuring would help Columbia stockholders.
But "the concept is workable.
You sell the good bank as an ongoing operation and use some of the proceeds to capitalize the bad bank," says thrift specialist Lewis Ranieri of Ranieri Associates in New York.
Mr. Spiegel's next career move is a subject of speculation on Wall Street.
Few people think Mr. Spiegel wants to run a bread-and-butter thrift, which current rules would force Columbia to become.
"They aren't really a thrift," says Jonathan Gray, a Sanford C. Bernstein analyst.
Of course, regulators would have to approve Columbia's reorganization.
And some investment bankers say a restructuring isn't feasible while the SEC still is scrutinizing Mr. Spiegel's past junk-bond trades.

Genetics Institute Inc., Cambridge, Mass., said it was awarded U.S. patents for Interleukin-3 and bone morphogenetic protein.
The patent for Interleukin-3 covers materials and methods used to make the human blood cell growth factor via recombinant DNA technology.
Sandoz Ltd. has licensed certain manufacturing and marketing rights for Interleukin-3 from Genetics Institute and is conducting preclinical studies with it.
Interleukin-3 may help in treating blood cell deficiencies associated with cancer treatment, bone marrow transplants and other blood-cell disorders, Genetics Institute said.
The second patent describes bone morphogenetic protein-1, a substance that can induce formation of new cartilage.
The patent covers BMP-1 type proteins and pharmaceutical compositions and methods for treating bone or cartilage defects, Genetics Institute said.
The company added that it has filed patent applications "on a large number of different BMP proteins" and the patent on BMP-1 is the first it has received.
BMP products may be useful in fracture healing and in treating bone loss associated with periodontal disease and certain cancers, the company said.
The Bush administration's nomination of Clarence Thomas to a seat on the federal appeals court here received a blow this week when the American Bar Association gave Mr. Thomas only a "qualified" rating, rather than "well qualified."
People familiar with the Senate Judiciary Committee, which will vote on the nomination, said some liberal members of the panel are likely to question the ABA rating in hearings on the matter.
Mr. Thomas, currently chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, would add another conservative voice to the closely divided court.
Groups have accused him of advocating policies that narrowed rights of older workers and of ignoring discrimination by large companies.
Fourteen members of the House with jurisdiction over the EEOC have said they oppose Mr. Thomas's nomination because of "serious questions about his judgment {and} respect for the law."
A senior Justice Department official, however, said the administration isn't worried about the ABA rating.
"We're pleased the ABA rated him qualified," David Runkel, the department's chief spokesman, said in an interview.
The ABA gives a "qualified" rating to nominees it believes would perform "satisfactorily" on the bench.
In contrast, the lawyers' association gives a "well qualified" rating to those "regarded as one of the best available for the vacancy.
Metallgesellschaft AG said it agreed to acquire 51% of Lentjes AG from the Ferdinand Lentjes Foundation.
Terms weren't disclosed.
Metallgesellschaft, a diversified Frankfurt, West Germany-based metals group, said it is buying the stake in the specialized engineering company to expand its production of environmental supplies for power plants.
Lentjes' product mix of specialized boilers and pipes provides a good fit with its own Lurgi G.m.b. H. plant engineering unit, the company said.
The move is part of a strategy to focus on its core metals trading, processing and plant engineering activities while shedding peripheral units, the company said.
Lentjes had 1988 sales of 800 million marks ($434.4 million) and has a current order backlog of 2.5 billion marks.
The sale comes in place of a planned initial public offering of Lentjes stock.
A plan to bring the stock to market before year end apparently was upset by the recent weakness of Frankfurt share prices.
The U.S. International Trade Commission issued preliminary rulings under the U.S. anti-dumping act that imports of sweaters from Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea may be injuring a domestic industry.
Because of the rulings, the Commerce Department will continue to investigate complaints by U.S. sweater makers that the imports are reaching the U.S. at unfairly low prices in violation of the U.S. anti-dumping act.
The law defines unfairly low prices as ones below the cost of production or below prices in an exporter's home market.
ITC officials said final Commerce Department and ITC rulings won't come until next March or later.
If both agencies find violations of the U.S. trade law, the U.S. would assess penalty duties on the imports, which already are subject to import quotas under bilateral textile and apparel trade agreements.
Imports of manmade-fiber sweaters in 1988 totaled about $405 million from Taiwan, $400 million from South Korea and $125 million from Hong Kong, according to the ITC.
In another action, the ITC dismissed anti-dumping act complaints filed by Du Pont Co. of Wilmington, Del., against imports of neoprene, a type of synthetic rubber, from France and West Germany.
These imports totaled about $17 million last year.
Upjohn Co. said it will offer an early retirement package to as many as 1,100 employees in a cost-cutting move expected to result in a fourth-quarter charge.
Upjohn officials said they couldn't estimate the size of the charge until they determine which employees, and how many, will participate in the retirement plan.
But the pharmaceutical company said it "anticipates the long-term savings resulting from the plan's implementation will more than offset short-term costs."
The program, available to Upjohn employees 55 years old or older, could increase an individual's retirement benefits 10% to 20%.
In addition, Upjohn is offering a one-time retirement bonus equal to six months of base pay.
Chairman Theodore Cooper called the program part of the company's two-year strategy to implement budget constraints and "an effective headcount-control program."
But some analysts questioned how much of an impact the retirement package will have, because few jobs will end up being eliminated.
"It's a cosmetic move," said Jonathan S. Gelles of Wertheim Schroder & Co.
According to Upjohn's estimates, only 50% to 60% of the 1,100 eligible employees will take advantage of the plan.
Upjohn further estimated that about 50% of the employees who leave for early retirement may be replaced.
As a result, Upjohn will likely trim only about 275 to 350 of its more than 21,000 jobs world-wide.
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Upjohn shares rose 87.5 cents to $38.875 apiece.
An Upjohn spokesman said he had "heard nothing" to suggest the early retirement package was spurred by shareholder pressure or a potential bidder for the company, which occasionally has been the target of takeover speculation.
The company earlier this year adopted a shareholder-rights plan to ward off unwanted suitors.
The spokesman said it is the first early retirement plan offered under its two-year cost-control strategy.
Earlier staff-reduction moves have trimmed about 300 jobs, the spokesman said.

"Feeding Frenzy" (Henry Holt, 326 pages, $19.95), a highly detailed account of the Wedtech scandal, begins on a reassuring note.
Right up front in the preface, co-author William Sternberg gives us an example of his own integrity.
When offered a free trip from the Bronx, Wedtech's home, to Washington, D.C., by one of Wedtech's principals, he tells the reader, "mindful of accepting anything of value from those I was writing about, I declined."
Any question as to why an author would believe this plaintive, high-minded note of assurance is necessary is answered by reading this book about sticky fingers and sweaty scammers.
Bribe by bribe, Mr. Sternberg and his co-author, Matthew C. Harrison Jr., lead us along the path Wedtech traveled, from its inception as a small manufacturing company to the status of full-fledged defense contractor, entrusted with the task of producing vital equipment for the Army and Navy.
The book revolves around John Mariotta, the founder of the company, and Fred Neuberger, who became his partner soon after Wedtech's creation.
Although started in 1965, Wedtech didn't really get rolling until 1975, when Mr. Neuberger discovered the federal government's Section 8 (A) minority business program.
This is a Johnson-era, Great Society creation that mandates certain government contracts be awarded noncompetitively to minority businesses.
Mr. Neuberger realized that, although of Italian ancestry, Mr. Mariotta still could qualify as a minority person since he was born in Puerto Rico.
The two partners merely had to falsify the true ownership of the corporation.
Instead of 50/50 it became, on paper only, two-thirds Mariotta, one-third Neuberger, and they were in the program and off to the races.
Besides being a "minority-owned company" Wedtech was located in the South Bronx, a blighted area, made famous by Jimmy Carter in his 1976 presidential campaign.
The company plugged itself right into Carter campaign rhetoric about rebuilding the South Bronx and kept using the minority -- South Bronx angle through the Reagan '80s.
Starting with Congressman Mario Biaggi (now serving a jail sentence), the company began a career of bribing federal, state and local public officials and those close to public officials, right up to and including E. Robert Wallach, close friend and adviser to former Attorney General Ed Meese.
Wedtech didn't just use old fashioned bribery.
It made ample use of the modern techniques of influence peddling, retaining politically connected "respectable" law firms, investment bankers and political consultants, including Reagan confidant Lyn Nofzinger.
When necessary, it sought and received assistance from organized crime.
Sometimes the bribed became partners in the company.
Wedtech management used the merit system.
If you were especially helpful in a corrupt scheme you received not just cash in a bag, but equity.
If you were not an effective crook, you found yourself out in the cold, a fate that eventually befell Mr. Mariotta, the firm's semiliterate "minority" person.
But despite the sensational nature of the revelations and the breezy, easy-to-read tabloid writing style, "Feeding Frenzy" often falls short of gripping reading.
None of the scams show much ingenuity: Auditors found crookery the first day on the job.
Wedtech's scammers simply bribed them to shut up.
The scammers themselves were garden-variety low lifes, conspicuous consumers who wanted big houses, Mercedes cars, beautiful women, expensive clothes.
Among the lot of them, not one is wrestling with good and evil, or especially intelligent or even temporarily insane.
The one character at least somewhat interesting was Irving Louis Lobsenz, a pediatrician who changed his name to Rusty Kent London and became a master gambler and author of a book on blackjack.
He enters the story toward the end, just in time to get arrested.
Absorbed in doling out "Feeding Frenzy's" tidbits, the authors gloss over the root causes of Wedtech, namely the Section 8 (A) federal program under whose auspices the scandal took place.
They do at least come around to saying that the courts might want to end "rigid affirmative action programs."
Programs like Section 8 (A) are a little like leaving gold in the street and then expressing surprise when thieves walk by to scoop it up.
Numerous other scandals, among them the ones at HUD, have the same characteristics as Wedtech.
They take place in government programs that seem tailor-made for corruption.
Why are programs like this not eliminated?
"Feeding Frenzy" does provide a few clues.
In and around all levels of government in the U.S. are groups of people who can best be described as belonging to a political insider commercial party.
They know that whenever government is redistributing wealth, regulating commerce or maintaining a large defense establishment, there is big money to be made in influencing, brokering or selling the processes and decisions of government.
They are our version of the East bloc's Nomenklatura and they have absolutely no wish to see anything change.
How many government programs and policies exist because they line the pockets of political insiders?
This is the real issue raised by the Wedtech scandal.
Mr. Stern was chairman and chief executive officer of the New York State Urban Development Corp., 1983-85.
The Finnish government and major creditors of bankrupt shipyard Waertsilae Marine Industries Oy agreed in principle to form a new company to complete most of the troubled shipyard's backlog of 15 ships.
The new company will attempt to limit the shipyard's losses, participants said.
"The situation is that the bankruptcy court will get out of the shipbuilding business.
Everything will be taken over by the new company," said Christian Andersson, executive vice president of Oy Waertsilae, former parent of Waertsilae Marine.
Once its ownership is finalized, the new company will open talks with state-appointed receivers to buy or lease Waertsilae Marine's shipyard facilities.
Subcontractors will be offered a settlement and a swift transition to new management is expected to avert an exodus of skilled workers from Waertsilae Marine's two big shipyards, government officials said.
Under an accord signed yesterday, the government and Union Bank of Finland would become major shareholders in the new company, each injecting 100 million Finnish markkaa ($23.5 million).
Oy Waertsilae is to contribute 200 million markkaa, most of it as subordinated debt, and take a minority stake in the new company.
Customers holding contracts for Waertsilae Marine's undelivered ships are expected to subscribe most of the remaining 170 million markkaa in share capital, government officials said.
Waertsilae Marine's biggest creditor is Miami-based Carnival Cruise Lines Inc.
Carnival, which has three ships on order from Waertsilae Marine, presented claims for $1.5 billion damages in the bankruptcy court this week.
Waertsilae Marine's bankruptcy proceedings began Tuesday in a Helsinki court.
Its plans to be acquired dashed, Comprehensive Care Corp. said it plans to sell most of its psychiatric and drug abuse facilities in California and some other assets to pay its debt and provide working capital.
In all, the company hopes to repay $45 million in debt through the sales, which will completely discharge its secured debt, the company said.
In addition, the company has replaced its president and chief executive, naming W. James Nichol, head of the company's contract health services, to succeed B. Lee Karns.
Mr. Nichol said he was "extremely disappointed in the continuing deterioration of the company's operations while it attempted to conclude the reorganization during the past four months."
Concurrent with Mr. Nichol's appointment, Comprehensive Care moved its corporate headquarters from Irvine, Calif., to St. Louis, where the company maintained its contract services offices.
Mr. Karns continues as chairman.
Comprehensive Care had agreed to be acquired by closely held First Hospital Corp. of Norfolk, Va., but the sale sputtered almost from the beginning and finally collapsed last week.
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Comprehensive Care closed at $3.75 a share, up 12.5 cents.
Ralston Purina Co. reported a 47% decline in fourth-quarter earnings, reflecting restructuring costs as well as a more difficult pet food market.
The St. Louis company earned $45.2 million, or 65 cents a share, compared with $84.9 million, or $1.24 a share, a year earlier.
Sales in the latest period were $1.76 billion, a 13% increase from last year's $1.55 billion.
For the year ended Sept. 30, Ralston earned $422.5 million, or $6.44 a share, up 8.9% from $387.8 million, or $5.63 a share.
This year's results included a gain of $70.2 million on the disposal of seafood operations.
Sales for the full year were $6.6 billion, up 13% from $5.8 billion.
Ralston said its restructuring costs include the phase-out of a battery facility in Greenville, N.C., the recent closing of a Hostess cake bakery in Cincinnati and a reduction in staff throughout the company.
The battery plant, which makes rechargeable nickel cadmium and carbon zinc products, will be closed over the next year or so, a spokesman said.
Ralston attributed its fourth-quarter slump partly to higher costs of ingredients in the pet food business as well as competitive pressures, which required higher advertising spending.
For the year, pet food volume was flat, the company said.
Its cereal division realized higher operating profit on volume increases, but also spent more on promotion.
The Continental Baking business benefited from higher margins on bread and on increased cake sales, it added.
Ralston said its Eveready battery unit was hurt by continuing economic problems in South America.
Ralston shares closed yesterday at $80.50, off $1, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.

First Chicago Corp. said it completed its $55.1 million cash-and-stock acquisition of closely held Ravenswood Financial Corp., another Chicago bank holding company.
The record corn-buying binge by the Soviet Union is causing serious bottlenecks in the U.S. grain pipeline.
The Soviet purchases are so massive that exporters are struggling to find enough river barges and trains to move the recently harvested Midwest crop to ports for loading onto Soviet ships.
River barge rates have soared 40% this fall from a year earlier.
Railroad companies and some ports are reaping a sudden windfall of business.
And some grain analysts are predicting that corn prices might gyrate this month as exporters scrounge to find enough of the crop to meet their obligations to the Soviets.
The Soviet Union bought roughly 310 million bushels of U.S. corn in October, which is the most ever sold to the Soviet Union in one month from the U.S..
The Soviet Union wants much of it delivered by January, which would be a strain in most years.
But it is particularly difficult this autumn because of low water levels on the Mississippi River, on which flows much of the U.S. corn that is shipped overseas.
"We are shipping the most corn in that short of time period to one customer on record," said William Dunton, a U.S. Agriculture Department transportation expert.
"It is going to be real tight."
Because of persistent dry weather in the northern Plains, the water level on the upper section of the Mississippi River is so low that many river operators are already trimming the number of barges their tows push at one time.
In a few weeks, many barges probably won't be able to operate fully loaded south of St. Louis because the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is beginning to reduce the flow of the Missouri River, which feeds into the Mississippi River.
The Army Corps is cutting the flow of the Missouri River about two weeks earlier than normal because of low water levels in the reservoirs that feed it.
Barge rates on the Mississippi River sank yesterday on speculation that widespread rain this week in the Midwest might temporarily alleviate the situation.
But the Army Corps of Engineers expects the river level to continue falling this month.
At St. Louis, the water level of the Mississippi River is already 6.5 feet below normal and it could drop an additional 2.5 feet when the flow of the Missouri River is slowed, an Army Corps spokesman said.
Similar levels hamstrung barge shipments last year in the wake of the worst drought in 50 years.
So far, the grain industry's budding logistical problems haven't been a major factor in the trading of corn contracts at the Chicago Board of Trade.
Many grain processors and exporters use the price of the corn futures contracts traded there to calculate the price they offer to buy corn from farmers.
At the Board of Trade yesterday the price of the corn contract for December delivery slipped 3.5 cents a bushel to settle at $2.375 a bushel.
Corn prices have been sluggish this fall despite the huge Soviet orders because the harvest has allowed farmers to rebuild the stockpiles depleted by the 1988 drought.
With the harvest winding down, however, some analysts are speculating that prices might jump in some regions as U.S. exporters try to gather the corn they are obligated to deliver.
Farmers are in the best position of many years to push up corn prices.
Because the drought reduced U.S. stockpiles, they have more than enough storage space for their new crop, and that permits them to wait for prices to rise.
In parts of Iowa, for example, some grain elevators are offering farmers $2.15 a bushel for corn.
Many farmers probably wouldn't sell until prices rose at least 20 cents a bushel, said Lyle Reed, president of Chicago Central & Pacific Railroad Co. of Waterloo, Iowa.
It isn't clear, however, who would win a waiting game.
Although U.S. corn stockpiles shrank by roughly half in the wake of the drought, the Agriculture Department projects that nearly one-fifth of the harvest will still be in storage before the 1990 corn harvest begins.
Some analysts are worried that reports of the grain industry's problems might spark investors to begin buying corn futures contracts -- only to see little appreciation.
"The public is buying the market when in reality there is plenty of grain to be shipped," said Bill Biedermann, Allendale Inc. research director.
Although much of this country's export corn goes to New Orleans by barge, it is possible for exporters to sidestep the Mississippi River by shipping a larger-than-normal amount of corn by train to the port.
Ports in the Great Lakes and Atlantic Coast can also relieve pressure on New Orleans.
One railroad, for example, is already increasing its grain hauling service from Indiana to Baltimore.
And it isn't clear that the Soviet Union will stay on its record buying pace.
The Soviet orders were compressed into the month of October because of delays.
The Soviet Union usually begins buying U.S. crops earlier in the fall.
But its purchases apparently were delayed by a reorganization of its agricultural bureaucracy as well as budget problems.
ENERGY: Crude oil futures prices increased in moderate trading, but much of the action was in heating oil.
Prices rose on the news that a sizable West German refinery was damaged in a fire, tightening an already tight European market.
Heating oil for November delivery ended at 58.64 cents a gallon, up one cent on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
West Texas Intermediate for December delivery advanced 22 cents to $19.94 a barrel.
Gasoline futures continued a sell-off that began Monday.
PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices eased as increased stability and strength came into the securities markets.
December delivery gold fell $3.20 an ounce to $377.60.
December silver declined 6.50 cents an ounce to $5.2180.
January platinum was down $5.70 an ounce at $494.50.
Precious metals, gold in particular, currently are being influenced more by stock market gyrations than the dollar as traders seek greater investment stability, according to William O'Neill, vice president of research at Elders Futures in New York.
"The recent rally in precious metals was a result of uncertainty and volatility in equities," he said.
Yesterday, the stock market rose strongly, creating a more defensive attitude among precious metals traders, he said.
Silver and platinum, which have more of an industrial nature than gold, were even weaker, he said.
Silver is also under pressure of "extremely high" inventories in warehouses of the Commodity Exchange, he said.
Yesterday, these stocks rose by 170,262 ounces to a record of 226,570,380 ounces, according to an exchange spokesman.
COPPER: Futures prices partially recovered Monday's declines because Chilean miners voted to strike.
The December contract rose 1.20 cents a pound to $1.14.
In Chile, workers at two copper mines, Los Bronces and El Soldado, which belong to the Exxon-owned Minera Disputada, yesterday voted to begin a full strike tomorrow, an analyst said.
Reasons for the walkout, the analyst said, included a number of procedural issues, such as a right to strike.
The analyst noted that also inherent in all metal markets was a sympathetic reaction to stocks.
In the case of copper, he said, the upbeat mood of stocks was reflected in demand for futures contracts because a stronger economy means greater buying interest for the metal.
Also contributing to the firmness in copper, the analyst noted, was a report by Chicago purchasing agents, which precedes the full purchasing agents' report that is due out today and gives an indication of what the full report might hold.
The Purchasing Management Association of Chicago's October index rose to 51.6% after three previous months of readings below 50%.
The September index was 47.1%.
A reading below 50% generally indicates a slowing in the industrial sector of the economy, while a reading above 50% points to expansion.
The Chicago report raised the possibility that the October survey of the National Association of Purchasing Management would also show a reading above 50%.
NCR Corp. unveiled two models of its Tower line of midrange computers and introduced advanced networking software to allow the Tower family to operate as a central hub in a network of computers.
The new software is based on Novell Inc.'s NetWare network operating system software.
USX Corp. posted a 23% drop in third-quarter profit, as improved oil results failed to offset weakness in steel and natural gas operations.
The nation's largest steelmaker earned $175 million, or 62 cents a share, compared with the year-earlier $228 million, or 80 cents a share.
The recent quarter includes pretax gains of $98 million from asset sales, while like gains in the year-earlier quarter totaled $61 million.
In the 1988 period, USX also had a $71 million after-tax gain from a tax dispute settlement.
Sales rose 5% to $4.4 billion from $4.2 billion.
The earnings drop appears particularly steep in comparison with last year's unusually strong third quarter, when the company was riding an industrywide boom in demand and pricing.
However, third-quarter operating profit fell 14%, as USX sold sizable chunks of its diversified and steel segments, eliminating income from those operations.
Among segments that continue to operate, though, the company's steel division continued to suffer from soft demand for its tubular goods serving the oil industry and other markets.
Peter Marcus, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc., said that a downturn in the appliance industry, coupled with sluggish automotive sales, hurt USX results.
Moreover, USX exports more than other steelmakers, and the overseas market has been under more severe pricing pressure.
The company attributed lower sales and earnings for the steel segment to the loss of results from the Lorain, Ohio, plant, which now is a 50-50 joint venture with Japan's Kobe Steel Ltd.
In the steel division, operating profit dropped 11% to $85 million.
Profit per ton of steel shipped dropped to about $33 a ton from $42 a ton last year and $53 a ton in the second quarter, analysts said.
Still, USX fared better than other major steelmakers, earning more per ton of steel shipped than either Bethlehem Steel Corp., which posted a 54% drop in net income, or Inland Steel Industries Inc., whose profit plummeted 70%.
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, USX shares closed up $1.25, at $34.625, as the reported earnings exceeded projections by some analysts who hadn't expected as great a volume of asset sales.
The rise in the stock's price may also reflect the fact that USX's steel segment fared better than some other steelmakers' .
Charles Bradford, an analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, said USX may have received orders lost by competitors who were involved in labor contracts earlier this year.
He said USX also appeared to sell a richer mix of steel products, such as the more profitable pipe and galvanized coated sheet, than lower-priced structural goods.
The energy segment, with a 15% rise in operating profit, is clearly the company's strongest.
Higher crude oil prices helped boost operating profit for the Marathon Oil Co. unit to $198 million from $180 million.
The Texas Oil & Gas division continues to operate in the red, although losses narrowed to $9 million from $15 million.
USX announced in October that it was soliciting bids to sell TXO's oil and gas reserves.
Proceeds of that sale are to be used to reduce debt and buy back shares.
The company noted that it has reduced debt by $1.6 billion since the end of 1988 and bought back about 15.5 million shares of common stock since the fourth quarter of 1987.
USX has about $5.5 billion in long-term debt and 257 million shares outstanding.
The announced sale of the reserves was followed by news that investor Carl Icahn had increased his stake in USX to 13.1% and threatened a takeover or other business combination.
Mr. Icahn has said he believes USX would be worth more if broken up into steel and energy segments.
Profit for the nine months jumped 21% to $721 million, or $2.62 a share, from $598 million, or $2.07 a share.
Sales rose 10% to $13.8 billion from $12.5 billion.
John F. Barrett, 40, formerly executive vice president and chief financial officer, was named president and chief operating officer, posts which had been vacant.
Leon J. Level, vice president and chief financial officer of this computer services concern, and F. Warren McFarlan, a professor at Harvard University's Graduate School of Business, were elected directors, increasing board membership to nine.
David A. DiLoreto, president of metal container division, was named to the additional post of group vice president, packaging products, at this packaging, industrial and aerospace products concern, succeeding Delmont A. Davis, who was named president and chief operating officer in August.
Two leading constitutional-law experts said President Bush doesn't have the legal authority to exercise a line-item veto.
Professors Philip Kurland of the University of Chicago and Laurence Tribe of Harvard Law School said any effort by President Bush to claim authority for a line-item veto would contradict the text of the Constitution and the intent of its authors, as well as the views of previous presidents.
A line-item veto is a procedure that would allow a president to veto part of a big congressional spending bill without having to scuttle the entire measure.
Mr. Bush has said he would like to be able to use this procedure.
A White House spokesman said last week that the president is considering declaring that the Constitution implicitly gives him the authority for a line-item veto to provoke a test case.
But the two legal experts, responding to an inquiry by Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.), wrote in a joint letter that the president "lacks the constitutional authority to exercise a line-item veto."
The two professors represent different ends of the political spectrum -- Mr. Kurland is a conservative and Mr. Tribe is a liberal.
The two professors said the Constitution authorizes the president to veto entire bills, not partial measures.
Moreover, they said the first appropriations bill passed 200 years ago covered many different items, and there was no discussion of a line-item veto.
They also said that more than a dozen presidents have called for line-item veto authority since the Civil War, and "all have shared the view that such lawmaking power is beyond the reach" of the president.
Sen. Kennedy said in a separate statement that he supports legislation to give the president line-item veto power, but that it would be a "reckless course of action" for President Bush to claim the authority without congressional approval.
Trinity Industries Inc. said it reached a preliminary agreement to sell 500 railcar platforms to Trailer Train Co. of Chicago.

Investors are appealing to the Securities and Exchange Commission not to limit their access to information about stock purchases and sales by corporate insiders.
A SEC proposal to ease reporting requirements for some company executives would undermine the usefulness of information on insider trades as a stock-picking tool, individual investors and professional money managers contend.
They make the argument in letters to the agency about rule changes proposed this past summer that, among other things, would exempt many middle-management executives from reporting trades in their own companies' shares.
The proposed changes also would allow executives to report exercises of options later and less often.
Many of the letters maintain that investor confidence has been so shaken by the 1987 stock market crash -- and the markets already so stacked against the little guy -- that any decrease in information on insider-trading patterns might prompt individuals to get out of stocks altogether.
"The SEC has historically paid obeisance to the ideal of a level playing field," wrote Clyde S. McGregor of Winnetka, Ill., in one of the 92 letters the agency has received since the changes were proposed Aug. 17.
"Apparently the commission did not really believe in this ideal."
Currently, the rules force executives, directors and other corporate insiders to report purchases and sales of their companies' shares within about a month after the transaction.
But about 25% of the insiders, according to SEC figures, file their reports late.
The changes were proposed in an effort to streamline federal bureaucracy and boost compliance by the executives "who are really calling the shots," said Brian Lane, special counsel at the SEC's office of disclosure policy, which proposed the changes.
Investors, money managers and corporate officials had until today to comment on the proposals, and the issue has produced more mail than almost any other issue in memory, Mr. Lane said.
The SEC will probably vote on the proposal early next year, he said.
Not all those who wrote oppose the changes.
The Committee on Federal Regulation of Securities for the American Bar Association argues, for example, in its lengthy letter to the SEC, that the proposed changes "would substantially improve the {law} by conforming it more closely to contemporary business realities."
What the investors who oppose the proposed changes object to most is the effect they say the proposal would have on their ability to spot telltale "clusters" of trading activity -- buying or selling by more than one officer or director within a short period of time.
According to some estimates, the rule changes would cut insider filings by more than a third.
The SEC's Mr. Lane vehemently disputed those estimates.
The rules will eliminate filings policy-making divisions, such as sales, marketing, finance and research and development, Mr. Lane said.
The proposed rules also would be tougher on the insiders still required to file reports, he said.
Companies would be compelled to publish in annual proxy statements the names of insiders who fail to file reports on time.
Considered as a whole, Mr. Lane said, the filings required under the proposed rules "will be at least as effective, if not more so, for investors following transactions."
But Robert Gabele, president of Invest/Net, a North Miami, Fla., company that packages and sells the insider-trading data, said the proposal is worded so vaguely that key officials may fail to file the reports.
Many investors wrote asking the SEC to require insiders to report their purchases and sales immediately, not a month later.
But Mr. Lane said that while the SEC regulates who files, the law tells them when to do so.
Investors who want to change the required timing should write their representatives in Congress, he added.
The SEC would likely be amenable to legislation that required insiders to file transactions on a more timely basis, he said.
The nation's largest pension fund, which oversees $80 billion for college employees, plans to offer two new investment options to its 1.2 million participants.
The Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association-College Retirement Equities Fund said it will introduce a stock and bond fund that will invest in "socially responsible" companies, and a bond fund.
Both funds are expected to begin operation around March 1, subject to Securities and Exchange Commission approval.
For its employees to sign up for the options, a college also must approve the plan.
Some 4,300 institutions are part of the pension fund.
The new options carry out part of an agreement that the pension fund, under pressure to relax its strict participation rules and to provide more investment options, reached with the SEC in December.
The new "social choice" fund will shun securities of companies linked to South Africa, nuclear power and in some cases, Northern Ireland.
Also excluded will be investments in companies with "significant" business stemming from weapons manufacture, alcoholic beverages or tobacco.
Sixty percent of the fund will be invested in stocks, with the rest going into bonds or short-term investments.
The bond fund will invest in high-grade or medium-grade bonds, mortgages or asset-backed securities, including as much as 15% in foreign securities.
The fund also might buy and sell futures and options contracts, subject to approval by the New York State Insurance Department.
Under two new features, participants will be able to transfer money from the new funds to other investment funds or, if their jobs are terminated, receive cash from the funds.
The investment choices offered by the pension fund currently are limited to a stock fund, an annuity and a money-market fund.
New Brunswick Scientific Co., a maker of biotechnology instrumentation and equipment, said it adopted an anti-takeover plan giving shareholders the right to purchase shares at half price under certain conditions.

Solo woodwind players have to be creative if they want to work a lot, because their repertoire and audience appeal are limited.
The oboist Heinz Holliger has taken a hard line about the problem: He commissions and splendidly interprets fearsome contemporary scores and does some conducting, so he doesn't have to play the same Mozart and Strauss concertos over and over again.
Richard Stoltzman has taken a gentler, more audience-friendly approach.
Years ago, he collaborated with the new music gurus Peter Serkin and Fred Sherry in the very countercultural chamber group Tashi, which won audiences over to dreaded contemporary scores like Messiaen's "Quartet for the End of Time."
Today, the pixie-like clarinetist has mostly dropped the missionary work (though a touch of the old Tashi still survives) and now goes on the road with piano, bass, a slide show, and a repertoire that ranges from light classical to light jazz to light pop, with a few notable exceptions.
Just the thing for the Vivaldi-at-brunch set, the yuppie audience that has embraced New Age as its very own easy listening.
But you can't dismiss Mr. Stoltzman's music or his motives as merely commercial and lightweight.
He believes in what he plays, and he plays superbly.
His recent appearance at the Metropolitan Museum, dubbed "A Musical Odyssey," was a case in point.
It felt more like a party, or a highly polished jam session with a few friends, than a classical concert.
Clad in his trademark black velvet suit, the soft-spoken clarinetist announced that his new album, "Inner Voices," had just been released, that his family was in the front row, and that it was his mother's birthday, so he was going to play her favorite tune from the record.
He launched into Saint-Saens's "The Swan" from "Carnival of the Animals," a favorite encore piece for cellists, with lovely, glossy tone and no bite.
Then, as if to show that he could play fast as well, he offered the second movement from Saint-Saens's Sonata for Clarinet, a whimsical, puckish tidbit that reflected the flip side of the Stoltzman personality.
And so it went through the first half: an ingeniously chosen potpourri of pieces, none longer than five minutes, none that would disturb or challenge a listener.
Mr. Stoltzman introduced his colleagues: Bill Douglas, pianist/bassoonist/composer and an old buddy from Yale, and jazz bassist Eddie Gomez.
An improvisational section was built around pieces by Mr. Douglas, beginning with "Golden Rain," a lilting, laid-back lead in to the uptempo "Sky," which gave Mr. Stoltzman the opportunity to wail in a high register and show off his fleet fingers.
Bach's "Air" followed.
Mr. Stoltzman tied the composer in by proclaiming him "the great improviser of the 18th century," and then built on the image by joining with Mr. Douglas in some Bach two-part inventions, cleverly arranged for clarinet and bassoon by Mr. Douglas.
Keeping the mood light, the two then chanted and chortled their way through some murderous polyrhythms, devised by Mr. Douglas as an alternative to Hindemith's dry theory-teaching techniques, and then, with Mr. Gomez, soared and improvised on the composer's tight "Bebop Etudes."
The end of the first half, however, brought what the standing-room-only crowd seemed to be waiting for: the pop singer Judy Collins, who appears on "Inner Voices."
Glamorous and pure-voiced as ever, Ms. Collins sang Joni Mitchell's "For Free" -- about an encounter with a street-corner clarinetist, to which Mr. Stoltzman contributed a clarinet obligatto -- and Mr. Douglas's lush setting of a Gaelic blessing, "Deep Peace."
"Deep Peace" also featured a slide show of lovely but predictable images of clouds, beaches, deserts, sunsets, etc.
It was all too mellow to be believed, but they probably would have gotten away with it, had they not felt compelled to add Ms. Collins's signature tune, "Amazing Grace," and ask for audience participation.
That went over the permissible line for warm and fuzzy feelings.
Was this why some of the audience departed before or during the second half?
Or was it because Ms. Collins had gone?
Either way it was a pity, because Mr. Stolzman offered the most substantial music of the evening just after intermission: Steve Reich's "New York Counterpoint," one of a series of Reich works that juxtapose a live performer with recorded tracks of his or her own playing.
Mr. Stoltzman must have worried that his audience might not be able to take it: He warned us in advance that "New York Counterpoint" lasts 11 1/2 minutes.
He also unfortunately illustrated this intricate, jazzy tapestry with Mr. Pearson's images, this time of geometric or repeating objects, in a kitschy mirroring of the musical structure that was thoroughly distracting from Mr. Reich's piece and Mr. Stoltzman's elegant execution of it.
The rest of the concert was more straight jazz and mellow sounds written by Charlie Parker, Ornette Coleman, Bill Douglas and Eddie Gomez, with pictures for the Douglas pieces.
It was enjoyable to hear accomplished jazz without having to sit in a smoke-filled club, but like the first half, much of it was easy to take and ultimately forgettable.
Is this the future of chamber music?
Managers and presenters insist that chamber music concerts are a hard sell, but can audiences really enjoy them only if the music is purged of threatening elements, served up in bite-sized morsels and accompanied by visuals?
What's next?
Slides to illustrate Shostakovich quartets?
It was not an unpleasant evening, certainly, thanks to the high level of performance, the compositional talents of Mr. Douglas, and the obvious sincerity with which Mr. Stoltzman chooses his selections.
But it was neither deep nor lasting: light entertainment that was no substitute for an evening of Brahms.

One of Ronald Reagan's attributes as President was that he rarely gave his blessing to the claptrap that passes for "consensus" in various international institutions.
In fact, he liberated the U.S. from one of the world's most corrupt organizations -- UNESCO.
This is the U.N. group that managed to traduce its own charter of promoting education, science and culture.
Ever since, the remaining members have been desperate for the United States to rejoin this dreadful group.
Now UNESCO apologists are lobbying President Bush to renege on President Reagan's decision to depart.
But we can think of many reasons to stay out for the foreseeable future and well beyond.
The U.S., along with Britain and Singapore, left the agency when its anti-Western ideology, financial corruption and top leadership got out of hand.
The personal antics of agency Director Amadou-Mahtar M'Bow drew much attention, such as when several of his top aides were uncovered as KGB plants and ejected from France and when a mysterious office fire was set just before Congress sent accountants to trace U.S. funds.
Mr. M'Bow was an extreme case, but even his replacement, the more personally genial Spanish biochemist Federico Mayor, has had little success at achieving reforms.
Several ridiculous projects continue, including the "New International Economic Order," which means redistributionism from the West to pay for everyone else's statism.
The Orwellian "New World Information Order" would give government officials rights against the press; journalists would be obliged to kowtow to their government, which would have licensing and censorship powers and, indeed, duties to block printing of "wrong" ideas.
UNESCO somehow converted the founding U.N. ideals of individual rights and liberty into "peoples' rights."
Million-dollar conferences were held to chew on subjects such as "ethical responsibilities of scientists in support of disarmament" and "the impact of the activities of transnational corporations."
The agency was so totally subverted from the high principles of its founding that even the Soviets now wonder about an agency that seemed so congenial to them.
Glasnost may be partly responsible, but Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze last year admitted, "The exaggerated ideological approach undermined tolerance intrinsic to UNESCO."
UNESCO is now holding its biennial meetings in Paris to devise its next projects.
Mr. Mayor's hope that references to "press freedom" would survive unamended seems doomed to failure; the current phrasing is "educating the public and media to avoid manipulation."
He hasn't been able to replace the M'Bow cabal.
Soviets remain in charge of education programs, a former head of an African military tribunal for executions is in charge of culture, and a hard-line Polish communist in exile directs the human-rights and peace division.
Of the agency's 2,750 staff members, 230 are in the field working on actual projects, such as literacy and oceanographic research.
The position of the United States, which once contributed 25% of the budget, is that nothing has changed.
John Bolton, the assistant secretary of state for international organizations, told Congress that the continuing "statist, restrictive, nondemocratic" programs make rejoining any time soon "extremely unlikely."
This hasn't much bothered the UNESCO delegates, who last week couldn't even agree to raise funds by selling off a fancy 19th-century French chateau the agency somehow owns.
Other countries, including West Germany, may have a hard time justifying continued membership.
We see an even stronger argument against UNESCO than its unsurprising failure to reform.
This is that the Reagan Revolution spanning Eastern Europe and Tiananmen Square shows the power of ideas unencumbered by international civil servants or government functionaries.
Free markets, free minds and free elections have an appeal that seems to get muddled only when delivered through U.N. organizations -- which of course are made up largely of governments that fear these principles at home.
The Babelists of the United Nations are experts at obfuscation.
This can have its purposes at times, but there's no reason to cloud the importance and allure of Western concepts of freedom and justice.
We can see plenty of reasons to stay out, and none to rejoin UNESCO.
Researchers at Plant Genetic Systems N.V. in Belgium said they have developed a genetic engineering technique for creating hybrid plants for a number of key crops.
The researchers said they have isolated a plant gene that prevents the production of pollen.
The gene thus can prevent a plant from fertilizing itself.
Such so-called male-sterile plants can then be fertilized by pollen from another strain of the plant, thereby producing hybrid seed.
The new generation of plants will possess the flourishing, high-production trait known as "hybrid vigor," similar to that now seen in hybrid corn.
"The development could have a dramatic effect on farm production, especially cotton," said Murray Robinson, president of Delta & Pine Land Co., a Southwide Inc. subsidiary that is one of the largest cotton seed producers in the U.S..
On a commercial scale, the sterilization of the pollen-producing male part has only been achieved in corn and sorghum feed grains.
That's because the male part, the tassel, and the female, the ear, are some distance apart on the corn plant.
In a labor-intensive process, the seed companies cut off the tassels of each plant, making it male sterile.
They sow a row of male-fertile plants nearby, which then pollinate the male-sterile plants.
The first hybrid corn seeds produced using this mechanical approach were introduced in the 1930s and they yielded as much as 20% more corn than naturally pollinated plants.
The vast majority of the U.S. corn crop now is grown from hybrid seeds produced by seed companies.
A similar technique is almost impossible to apply to other crops, such as cotton, soybeans and rice.
The male part, the anthers of the plant, and the female, the pistils, of the same plant are within a fraction of an inch or even attached to each other.
The anthers in these plants are difficult to clip off.
In China, a great number of workers are engaged in pulling out the male organs of rice plants using tweezers, and one-third of rice produced in that country is grown from hybrid seeds.
At Plant Genetic Systems, researchers have isolated a pollen-inhibiting gene that can be inserted in a plant to confer male sterility.
Jan Leemans, research director, said this gene was successfully introduced in oil-producing rapeseed plants, a major crop in Europe and Canada, using as a carrier a "promoter gene" developed by Robert Goldberg at the University of California in Los Angeles.
The sterilizing gene is expressed just before the pollen is about to develop and it deactivates the anthers of every flower in the plant.
Mr. Leemans said this genetic manipulation doesn't hurt the growth of that plant.
The researchers also pulled off a second genetic engineering trick in order to get male-sterile plants in large enough numbers to produce a commercial hybrid seed crop.
They attached a second gene, for herbicide resistance, to the pollen-inhibiting gene.
Both genes are then inserted into a few greenhouse plants, which are then pollinated and allowed to mature and produce seed.
The laws of heredity dictate that half of the plants springing from these greenhouse-produced seeds will be male sterile and herbicide resistant and half will be male fertile and herbicide susceptible.
The application of herbicide would kill off the male-fertile plants, leaving a large field of male-sterile plants that can be cross-pollinated to produce hybrid seed.
Mr. Leemans said the hybrid rapeseeds created with this genetic engineering yield 15% to 30% more output than the commercial strains used currently.
"This technique is applicable to a wide variety of crops," he said, and added that some modifications may be necessary to accommodate the peculiarities of each type of crop.
He said the company is experimenting with the technique on alfalfa, and plans to include cotton and corn, among other crops.
He said that even though virtually all corn seeds currently planted are hybrids, the genetic approach will obviate the need for mechanical emasculation of anthers, which costs U.S. seed producers about $70 million annually.
In recent years, demand for hybrid seeds has spurred research at a number of chemical and biotechnology companies, including Monsanto Co., Shell Oil Co. and Eli Lilly & Co.
One technique developed by some of these companies involves a chemical spray supposed to kill only a plant's pollen.
But there have been problems with chemical sprays damaging plants' female reproductive organs and concern for the toxicity of such chemical sprays to humans, animals and beneficial insects.
However, Paul Johanson, Monsanto's director of plant sciences, said the company's chemical spray overcomes these problems and is "gentle on the female organ."
Biosource Genetics Corp., Vacaville, Calif., is developing a spray containing a gene that spreads from cell to cell and interferes with the genes that are responsible for producing pollen.
This gene, called "gametocide," is carried into the plant by a virus that remains active for a few days.
Robert Erwin, president of Biosource, called Plant Genetic's approach "interesting" and "novel," and "complementary rather than competitive."
"There is a large market out there hungry for hybrid seeds," he said.
Mr. Robinson of Delta & Pine, the seed producer in Scott, Miss., said Plant Genetic's success in creating genetically engineered male steriles doesn't automatically mean it would be simple to create hybrids in all crops.
That's because pollination, while easy in corn because the carrier is wind, is more complex and involves insects as carriers in crops such as cotton.
"It's one thing to say you can sterilize, and another to then successfully pollinate the plant," he said.
Nevertheless, he said, he is negotiating with Plant Genetic to acquire the technology to try breeding hybrid cotton.
A bitter conflict with global implications has erupted between Nomura Securities Co. and Industrial Bank of Japan, two of the world's most powerful financial companies.
The clash is a sign of a new toughness and divisiveness in Japan's once-cozy financial circles.
Not only are Japan's financial institutions putting their enormous clout to work; increasingly they're squaring off against one another in unprecedented public fashion.
Already, the consequences are being felt by other players in the financial markets -- even governments.
What triggered the latest clash was a skirmish over the timing of a New Zealand government bond issue.
Nomura was attempting to organize the 50 billion-yen ($352 million) borrowing in Japan at a time when many Japanese banks, led by Industrial Bank of Japan, were pressuring the Wellington government to help them recover loans made to a defunct investment bank that had been owned by New Zealand's civil-service pension fund.
Unwilling to put up new money for New Zealand until those debts are repaid, most banks refused even to play administrative roles in the new financing, forcing an embarrassed Nomura to postpone it this week.
The dispute shows clearly the global power of Japan's financial titans.
Aside from Nomura's injured pride, the biggest victim so far has been the New Zealand government.
Barred by its budget law from making any new domestic bond issues, Wellington's Debt Management Office had been casting abroad to raise the 3 billion New Zealand dollars (US$ 1.76 billion) to NZ$ 4 billion it needs to come up with by the end of its fiscal year next June 30.
With Japan's cash-flush banks aligned against it, though, raising money may be difficult.
Not only can they block Wellington from raising money in Japan, bankers here say, but as the largest underwriters in the Eurobond market, they might be able to scuttle borrowings there, too.
New Zealand's finance minister, David Caygill, lashed out at such suggestions.
He told reporters in Wellington Tuesday that the government hadn't guaranteed the loans to DFC New Zealand Ltd., an investment bank 80%-owned by the National Provident Fund, and wouldn't bail it out.
"It may very well be what the Japanese banks want," he told Radio New Zealand.
"I think it would be irresponsible and I am not about to be blackmailed by Japanese banks or any other international interests."
No less significant than the Japanese banks' attempt to cut off funds to pressure a foreign government are the implications of a confrontation between Japan securities and banking industries.
Anxiety is rising over recent government proposals to eventually lower the strict barriers that now separate -- and protect -- the two industries from each other.
Both sides are jealously guarding their turf, and relations have been at a flashpoint for months.
The banks badly want to break into all aspects of the securities business.
Meanwhile, the securities companies -- most of them smaller than the banks -- are seeking access only to limited kinds of banking that wouldn't open them to the full brunt of competition from the banks.
Nomura, the world's biggest securities company largely by virtue of its protected home field, and Industrial Bank of Japan, Japan's most innovative and aggressive bank in capital markets abroad, captain the opposing sides.
And their suspicions of each other run deep.
In the past year, both have tried to stretch the limits of their businesses.
Nomura started a credit-card venture with American Express Co. that allowed cardholders to use their Nomura securities accounts like a bank account, attracting the wrath of banks.
And Industrial Bank of Japan started up a London securities subsidiary that sells Japanese stocks to non-Japanese institutions overseas, a move that stirred the anger of the stock brokerage firms.
The New Zealand bond issue simply has brought the two institutions face-to-face.
ITEL CORP. reported third-quarter earnings, which were mistakenly shown in the Quarterly Earnings Surprises table in yesterday's edition to be lower than the average of analysts' estimates.
On a pretax basis, Itel's third-quarter earnings of 30 cents a share were actually 7.14% higher than the average of estimates.

He will be in charge of research, equity sales and trading, and the syndicate operation of Rothschild.
Mr. Conlon was executive vice president and director of the equity division of the international division of Nikko Securities Co.
As Yogi Berra might say, it's deja vu all over again.
Crouched at shortstop, Bert Campaneris, once Oakland's master thief, effortlessly scoops up a groundball and flips it to second.
In the outfield, Paul Blair, the Orioles' eight-time Gold Glove winner, elegantly shags a fly.
On the mound, former Red Sox great Luis Tiant, the wily master of 1,001 moves, throws an off-speed strike.
"Babies, kiddies," growls their manager -- a fellow named Earl Weaver, who, in a different time, handled four World Series teams and now handles the Gold Coast Suns.
"Old-time kiddies," he says.
Perhaps.
But for the next few months, these boys of summers long past are going to be reveling in an Indian summer of the soul.
Now that the baseball season is officially over, you see, it's time for a new season to begin.
Today is the debut of the Senior Professional Baseball Association, a new eight-team pro sports circuit, modeled after the highly successful senior tennis and golf tours and complete with good salaries, a cable television contract and even expansion plans.
One hundred and ninety two former greats, near greats, hardly knowns and unknowns begin a 72-game, three-month season in spring-training stadiums up and down Florida.
For everyone involved, it's one more swig of that elixir of youth, baseball.
"Someone always makes you quit," says legendary St. Louis Cardinals centerfielder Curt Flood, the league's commissioner.
"You feel you want one more -- one more at-bat, one more hit, one more game."
Until the baby-faced heroes of today reclaim these ballparks for spring training, there is one more.
And not just for the players.
It's one more for the baseball-loving lawyers, accountants and real estate developers who ponied up about $1 million each for the chance to be an owner, to step into the shoes of a Gene Autry or have a beer with Rollie Fingers.
"Nothing can be better than this," says Don Sider, owner of the West Palm Beach Tropics.
Early in the morning Mr. Sider, an estate lawyer, pores over last wills and testaments.
Midmorning, he dons an orange-and-blue uniform and, for fun, may field a bunt from Dave Kingman.
It's one more, too, for the fans who dream of a season that never ends.
"I feel like a little kid," says a gleeful Alex de Castro, a car salesman, who has stopped by a workout of the Suns to slip six Campaneris cards to the Great Man Himself to be autographed.
The league's promoters hope retirees and tourists will join die-hard fans like Mr. de Castro and pack the stands to see the seniors.
The league is the brainchild of Colorado real estate developer James Morley -- once a minor-leaguer himself -- who says he had the idea last January while lying on a beach in Australia.
When he sent letters offering 1,250 retired major leaguers the chance of another season, 730 responded.
Eventually, about 250 made the trip to Florida to compete for the available slots.
For some players, the lure is money -- up to $15,000 a month.
Others, just released from the majors, hope the senior league will be their bridge back into the big-time.
But as they hurl fireballs that smolder rather than burn, and relive old duels in the sun, it's clear that most are there to make their fans cheer again or recapture the camaraderie of seasons past or prove to themselves and their colleagues that they still have it -- or something close to it.
"My fastball is good.
Real good," says 39-year-old Pete Broberg, working in the midday heat of the Tropics camp.
Mr. Broberg, who started with the now-defunct Washington Senators, says that when he left baseball in 1978, he "never looked back."
For a long time, he ignored baseball altogether, even the sports pages.
Now Mr. Broberg, a lawyer, claims he'd play for free.
"You can't give it up that easily," he says.
"I tried."
The nagging memory of one afternoon fourteen years ago drove Jim Gideon, a lean 36-year-old righthander to take a four-month leave from selling insurance in Texas to try out for Mr. Weaver's team.
"It doesn't replace pitching in the majors, but it proves to me that I would have been able to play if I'd stayed healthy," he says.
Back in 1975, late in the season, a then-21 Mr. Gideon made his only major league appearance, five and two-thirds innings for the Texas Rangers against the Chicago White Sox.
He gave up seven hits, walked five and didn't get a decision.
Arm troubles forced him back to the minors the next year.
"There's a satisfaction in going against the rules," offers Will McEnaney, once a stopper with Cincinnati's Big Red Machine.
He means the rule that a player can't cut it after a certain age.
These days he hustles to house-painting jobs in his Chevy pickup before and after training with the Tropics.
While sipping a beer after practice, he vividly recounts getting the Red Sox's Carl Yastrzemski to pop out to end the 1975 World Series, and repeating the feat against the Yankees' Roy White in 1976.
Some of the game's reigning philosophers dislike the idea of middle-aged men attempting a young man's sport.
"I personally don't enjoy seeing players who I remember vividly from their playing days running about and being gallant about their deficiencies," says Roger Angell, New Yorker magazine's resident baseball sage.
"I feel people should be allowed to remember players as they were."
Worse, says baseball author Lawrence Ritter, "Someone will get a heart attack and that will be the end of the whole story."
But the ballplayers disagree.
Most are trim.
Some have been training for months; others only recently left active status.
And there's pride.
"I'm not going to look stupid," vows former Pittsburgh Pirate second baseman Rennie Stennett, sweat dotting his brow as he prepares for some practice swings.
"It's going to be a tough league," promises the 47-year-old Mr. Campaneris.
"There will be a lot of malice."
Men who have played hard all their lives aren't about to change their habits, he says.
Nonetheless, one can't help wonder whether the game will be just a little bit slower.
At the weatherbeaten Pompano Beach municipal stadium, Mr. Blair, the 45-year-old former Oriole, knows his power isn't what it used to be.
So he adjusts.
He no longer crowds the plate.
He's not thinking about home runs anymore, just base hits.
Still, "how sweet it is," he says, savoring the fat sound of the well-hit line drive that bounces off the center field wall.
And don't expect many complete games by pitchers -- perhaps three out of 288, laughs Mr. Fingers, the former Oakland reliever.
Expect "tricky" stuff from pitchers, says Mr. Weaver, the manager.
Expect brushbacks but no beanballs, says Mr. McEnaney.
Even expect stolen bases, says the wiry and fit Mr. Campaneris: "If you know how to slide, it's no problem," he says.
And expect slower fastballs.
"I'm not so young anymore," concedes the cigar-chomping, 48-year-old Mr. Tiant.
"I won't be throwing 90 mph, but I will throw 80-plus," he says.
White-haired Pedro Ramos, at 54 the league's oldest player and a pitcher-coach with the Suns, has lost even more speed.
Stuffing a wad of Red Man into his cheek, he admits the fastball he brought into the majors in 1955 has become a slowball.
Its maximum velocity is 72 mph.
But he isn't worried.
He will compensate with the guile learned from his years in the majors.
He has good control.
He will keep the ball down, move it around.
After all, he says, "Even to make love, you need experience.
Alltel Corp. said it will acquire the 55% of Pond Branch Telephone Company Inc.'s cellular franchise that it doesn't own already.

In a surprise move, the British government cleared the way for a bidding war for Jaguar PLC by agreeing to remove an obstacle to a takeover of the auto maker.
Trade and Industry Secretary Nicholas Ridley told the House of Commons yesterday that he will relinquish the government's so-called golden share in the company as long as Jaguar shareholders agree.
The golden share restricts any individual holding to 15% and expires at the end of 1990.
It was in Jaguar's best interests "for the company's future to be assured and the present climate of uncertainty resolved as quickly as possible," Mr. Ridley said.
Mr. Ridley's decision fires the starting pistol for perhaps a costly contest between the world's auto giants for Britain's leading luxury-car maker.
Both General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. have been trying to amass 15% stakes in Jaguar.
Ford, which already has an unwelcome 13.2% holding, is prepared to bid for the entire company and had lobbied the government to lift the takeover restrictions early.
GM has been negotiating a friendly transaction with Jaguar that likely would involve joint ventures and an eventual stake of just under 30%.
But the government's action, which caught Jaguar management flat-footed, may scuttle the GM minority deal by forcing it to fight for all of Jaguar.
"I can't believe they (GM) will let Ford have a free run," said Stephen Reitman, a European auto industry analyst at UBS-Phillips & Drew.
"I am sure they will be going for a full bid."
Many investors certainly believe a bidding war is imminent.
Jaguar shares skyrocketed yesterday after Mr. Ridley's announcement, following their temporary suspension on London's Stock Exchange.
In late trading, the shares were up a whopping 122 pence ($1.93) -- a 16.3% gain -- to a record 869 pence on very heavy volume of 9.7 million shares.
In the U.S. over-the-counter market, Jaguar shares trading as American Depositary Receipts closed at $13.625, up $1.75.
Analysts expect Ford will make the first move, perhaps today, with an initial offer of about 900 pence ($14.25) a share.
Such a proposal values Jaguar at more than # 1.6 billion ($2.53 billion).
Speculation about a takeover fight has sent Jaguar shares soaring in the past six weeks.
The share price was languishing at about 400 pence before Ford's Sept. 19 announcement of its interest in a minority stake.
Ford is "in the driving seat at the moment," observed Bob Barber, an auto analyst at brokers James Capel & Co.
An aggressive Ford bid for Jaguar would put pressure on GM to make a better offer as the British company's "white knight."
Such a countermove could end Jaguar's hopes for remaining independent and British-owned.
But it isn't clear how long GM would be willing to fight Ford for Jaguar.
Because of their longstanding rivalry, GM just "wants to make sure Ford pays a huge packet for (Jaguar)," said John Lawson, an auto analyst at London's Nomura Research Institute.
People close to the GM-Jaguar talks agreed that Ford now may be able to shut out General Motors.
"It's either going to be a shootout, or there only may be one player in town," one person said.
Another person close to the talks said, "It is very hard to justify paying a silly price for Jaguar if an out-and-out bidding war were to start now."
In a statement, Jaguar's board said they "were not consulted about the (Ridley decision) in advance and were surprised at the action taken."
The statement emphasized that holders representing 75% of the shares voting at a special shareholders' meeting must agree to lift the takeover restrictions.
Jaguar officials in the U.S. noted that Ford, as Jaguar's largest shareholder, now has the power to call for such a meeting.
U.S. auto analysts also noted that Ford is in the best position to benefit from the large number of Jaguar shares that have moved over the past month into the hands of arbitragers waiting for the highest takeover bid.
Jaguar's own defenses against a hostile bid are weakened, analysts add, because fewer than 3% of its shares are owned by employees and management.
Ford officials in the U.S. declined to comment on the British government's action or on any plans to call a special Jaguar shareholders meeting.
But GM officials said they, too, were surprised by the move, which left them to "consider all our options and explore matters further."
Although GM has U.S. approval to buy up to 15% of Jaguar's stock, it hasn't yet disclosed how many shares it now owns.
In a prepared statement, GM suggested its plans for Jaguar would be more valuable in the long run than the initial windfalls investors might reap from a hostile Ford bid.
"Our intensive discussions with Jaguar, at their invitation," GM said, "have as their objectives to create a cooperative business relationship with Jaguar that would provide for the continued independence of this great British car company, to ensure a secure future for its employees and to provide an attractive long-term return for its shareholders."
Jaguar was shocked by Mr. Ridley's decision, because management had believed the government wouldn't lift the golden share without consulting the company first.
Indeed, the government is taking a calculated risk.
Mr. Ridley's announcement set off a howl of protests from members of the opposition Labor Party, who accused the Thatcher administration of backing down on promised protection for a privatized company.
The Conservative government's decision may reflect its desire to shed a politically sensitive issue well before the next election, expected in late 1991.
"It's now a very good time politically to get this over and done with," observed Daniel Jones, professor of motor industry management at the University of Cardiff in Wales.
The government, already buffeted by high interest rates and a slowing economy, has been badly hurt by last week's shake-up in Mrs. Thatcher's cabinet.
At the same time, the government didn't want to appear to favor GM by allowing a minority stake that might preclude a full bid by Ford.
Mr. Ridley hinted at this motive in answering questions from members of Parliament after his announcement.
He said he was giving up the golden share "to clear the way so the playing field is level between all contestants."

William A. Wise, 44 years old, president of the El Paso Natural Gas Co. unit of this energy and natural-resources concern, was named to the additional post of chief executive officer, succeeding Travis H. Petty, 61, who continues as a vice chairman of the parent.
Erwin Tomash, the 67-year-old founder of this maker of data communications products and a former chairman and chief executive, resigned as a director.
Dataproducts is fighting a hostile tender offer by DPC Acquisition Partners, a group led by New York-based Crescott Investments Associates.
Under the circumstances, Dataproducts said, Mr. Tomash said he was unable to devote the time required because of other commitments.
Mr. Tomash will remain as a director emeritus.
The company had no comment on whether a replacement would be named.
Robert Q. Marston, president emeritus, University of Florida, and a director of this maker of medical devices, was named chairman.
Dr. Marston, 66 years old, succeeds Alexander T. Daignault, 72, who didn't stand for re-election due to mandatory board retirement policy.
SFE Technologies said William P. Kuehn was elected chairman and chief executive officer of this troubled electronics parts maker.
The 45-year-old Mr. Kuehn, who has a background in crisis management, succeeds Alan D. Rubendall, 45.
Jerome J. Jahn, executive vice president and chief financial officer, said Mr. Rubendall was resigning by "mutual agreement" with the board.
"He is going to pursue other interests," Mr. Jahn said.
Mr. Rubendall couldn't be reached.
Mr. Kuehn, the company said, will retain the rest of the current management team.
For the nine months ended July 29, SFE Technologies reported a net loss of $889,000 on sales of $23.4 million.
That compared with an operating loss of $1.9 million on sales of $27.4 million in the year-earlier period.
In national over-the-counter trading, SFE Technologies shares closed yesterday at 31.25 cents a share, up 6.25 cents.
Sales of new cars in Europe fell 4.2% in September from a year earlier and analysts say the market could continue to soften in the months ahead.
After a stronger-than-expected pace early this year, analysts say the market, after a series of sharp swings in recent months, now shows signs of retreating.
Statistics from 12 countries which normally account for 94% of non-communist Europe's passenger car sales showed new car registrations totaled 911,606 in September, down 21% from August and down 4.2% for the year to date.
Tokyo stocks rebounded Tuesday from two consecutive daily losses in relatively active dealings.
London shares also rose, while trading in Frankfurt, West Germany, ended higher.
In Tokyo, the Nikkei index of 225 selected issues was up 132.00 points to 35549.44.
The index fell 109.85 Monday.
Volume on the First Section was estimated at 900 million shares, up from 582 million shares Monday.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners 542 to 362, while 208 issues were unchanged.
Small-lot buying targeted at incentive-backed issues pushed up the Nikkei.
But other sectors failed to attract investor interest and remained sluggish, making overall trading appear mixed.
Individuals and corporations, as well as dealers trading for their own account, actively bought Tuesday.
An official at Wako Securities said these investors feel the need to make quick profits, despite destabilizing external factors, such as political uncertainty tied to the ruling party's fate at next year's Lower House elections-an event which could directly affect the stock market.
The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the First Section, which declined 5.16 on Monday, was up 16.05, or 0.60%, at 2692.65 on Tuesday.
The Second Section index, which fell 21.44 points Monday, was up 6.84 points, or 0.19%, to close at 3642.90.
Second Section volume was estimated at 14 million shares, unchanged from Monday.
Institutional investors mostly remained on the sidelines Tuesday.
A fund manager at a life-insurance company said three factors make it difficult to read market direction.
First, he said, domestic interest rates are likely to stay at higher levels as increased anticipation of inflation followed rising consumer prices reported last week.
Second, the dollar is showing persistent strength despite a slowdown in the U.S. economy shown by economic indicators.
Third, oil prices haven't declined although supply has been increasing.
The topic that attracted participants' attention was Mitsubishi Estate's purchase of 51% of Rockefeller Center Properties, announced late Monday in New York.
Mitsubishi Estate ended the day at 2680, up 150.
The gains also sparked buying interest in other real-estate companies, traders said.
Sumitomo Realty & Development rose 40 to 2170.
Heiwa Real Estate gained 40 to 2210.
Investor focus shifted quickly, traders said.
Many of the morning-session winners turned out to be losers by afternoon.
In other stock-market news, the Tokyo Stock Exchange said that for the week ended Friday, the balance of margin buying rose 189.8 billion yen ($1.34 billion), to 7.160 trillion yen ($50.46 billion).

In London, prices finished at intraday peaks, comforted by a reassuring early performance on Wall Street and news that the British government will waive its "golden share" in auto maker Jaguar.
But trading was very sketchy, as investment decision makers remain wary from gyrations and upsets of recent weeks.
"Volume has been appalling," said a dealer at a British brokerage concern.
"The market was dragged up by the scruff of its neck by Wall Street and by market makers getting caught short.
No one wants stock on their books."
Meanwhile, the broad-based Financial Times 100-share index added 30.4 points to end at 2142.6, while reaching its minimum of 2120.5 a half hour into the session.
At the close, the narrower 30-share index was up 19.7 points to 1721.4.
Volume totaled a modest 334.5 million shares, up from 257.8 million shares Monday.
The market also moved at early afternoon on news that Jaguar shares were being temporarily suspended at 746 pence ($11.80) each.
Secretary of State for Trade and Industry Nicholas Ridley said later in the day that the government would abolish its golden share in Jaguar, the luxury auto maker being stalked by General Motors and Ford Motor.
The golden share dates from Jaguar's public offering in 1984 and was designed to protect the company from takeover.
But although the golden share has been waived, a hostile bidder for Jaguar would still have to alter the British concern's articles of association which ban shareholdings of more than 15%.
Jaguar shares closed at 869 pence, up 122 pence, on hefty turnover of 9.7 million shares.
As the London trading session drew to a close, the market was still listening to the parliamentary debate on the economy, with new Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major expected to clarify his approach to the British economy and currency issues.
On the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, share prices closed higher in fairly thin trading, as selective buying by foreigners helped propel prices.
The DAX index closed at 1472.76, up from 1466.29.
Despite the modest gains, traders said the market remains dull, with investors remaining cautiously on the sidelines.
Contributing to the market's reserved stance was the release later in the day of new data on the health of the U.S. economy, in the form of the U.S. index of leading indicators.
Additionally, the end of the month position-squaring might have also played a minor role, traders said.
Elsewhere, share prices closed higher in Amsterdam, Brussels, Milan and Paris.
Prices were mixed in Zurich and lower in Stockholm.
Stocks closed higher in Hong Kong, Manila, Singapore, Sydney and Wellington, but were lower in Seoul.
Taipei was closed for a holiday.
Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva.
To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100.
The percentage change is since year-end.
French consumer prices rose 0.2% in September from the previous month and were up 3.4% from a year earlier, according to definitive figures from the National Statistics Institute.
The state agency's figures confirm previous estimates and leave the index at 178.9, up from 178.5 in August and 173.1 a year earlier.
The index is based on 1980 equaling 100.
A breakdown showed that food prices were the most active part of growth with a rise of 0.6%.
An official linked the gain essentially to higher prices for beef and pork.
He said summer drought problems that had hit several southern agricultural regions had stopped being a major source of price pressure in September.
Japan's index of leading indicators rose to 63.6 in August, above the so-called boom-or-bust line of 50 for the first time since May, the Economic Planning Agency said.
The leading index recovered from July's revised level of 36.6 on strong performances in consumer durables and machinery orders, among other factors, according to an agency spokeswoman.
The index is intended to measure future economic performance.
A figure above 50 indicates the economy is likely to expand; one below 50 indicates a contraction may be ahead.
Metromedia Co. said its Metromedia Long Distance unit has been renamed Metromedia-ITT Long Distance, reflecting acquisitions from ITT Corp., which licenses its name to closely held Metromedia.
Metromedia said its unit is the fifth-largest provider of long-distance communications service in the U.S., with projected 1989 revenue of more than $550 million.
Metromedia, headed by John W. Kluge, has interests in telecommunications, robotic painting, computer software, restaurants and entertainment.
South Korean consumer prices rose 5% in the first 10 months of this year, matching the government's target for the entire year, according to the Bank of Korea and the Economic Planning Board.
According to reports released by the two government agencies, domestic consumer and wholesale prices each rose by 0.2% in October from the previous month.
As a result, consumer prices for the first 10 months of 1989 surged by 5% and wholesale prices by 1.3%.
The South Korean government had been projecting a 5% consumer price increase for the entire year.
Martin Marietta Corp. said it won a $38.2 million contract from the U.S. Postal Service to manufacture and install automated mail-sorting machines.
Under terms of the three-year contract, Martin Marietta said it will make and install 267 of the new machines at 156 postal offices.
The new machines are capable of sorting by zip code up to 10,000 large flat mail pieces, including magazines and parcels, an hour.
Thomas A. Donovan, 37 years old, formerly vice president, West Coast operations, at this hazardous-waste-site remediation concern, was named executive vice president and chief operating officer, both newly created posts, and a director, filling a vacancy.
Canonie said it anticipates naming Mr. Donovan to succeed Richard F. Brissette, 55, as president and chief executive officer, effective March 1.
Mr. Brissette will remain a Canonie board member and will be a consultant to the company.
Yields on savings-type certificates of deposit dropped slightly in the week ended yesterday.
The average yield on a six-month CD of $50,000 or less was 7.90%, compared with 7.94% a week earlier.
The average one-year savings-type CD was down to 7.99% from 8.01%, according to Banxquote Money Markets, a New York information service that tracks CD yields.
"This week was uneventful for the CD market," said Norberto Mehl, chairman of Banxquote.
"The major banks haven't even reacted to sharp rises in the three-month Treasury bill rates" in the past two weeks.
Banks that adjusted payouts on CDs in the most recent week made only fractional moves, he said.
The CD trend runs counter to the direction of short-term interest rates at the Treasury bill auction Monday.
The average six-month bill was sold with a yield of 8.04%, up from 7.90%.
The average three-month issue rose to 8.05% from 7.77%.
Typically, banks offer CD yields higher than those on Treasury bills, which are considered the safest short-term investments; banks need a competitive edge to sell their products.
But when market interest rates move up rapidly, increases in bank CD yields sometimes lag.
Most yields on short-term jumbo CDs, those with denominations over $90,000, also moved in the opposite direction of Treasury bill yields.
The average six-month yield on a jumbo CD was at 7.90%, down from 7.93%, Banxquote said.
For longer-term CDs, yields were up.
The average two-year and five-year jumbos were up 0.02 of a percentage point to 7.91% and 7.96%, respectively.
However, CDs sold through major broker-dealer networks were up slightly almost across the board.
The average six-month CD in that category added 0.05 percentage point to 8.35%, for example.
Mr. Mehl attributed the rise specifically to the Treasury bill increase.
Among the major banks surveyed by Banxquote in six regions of the country, 8.33% is the highest yield available.
It is offered by the flagship banks of New York's Manufacturers Hanover Corp. in the one-year maturity only.
The yield is offered across a range of maturities at San Francisco's BankAmerica Corp. and Wells Fargo & Co.
Just two weeks ago, BankAmerica's yields in many of those maturities was 8.61%.
Still, on average, the major California banks have the highest yields on CDs, according to Banxquote.
The average yield there on six-month issues is 8.32%.
I had to reach back to French 101 when the monsieur avec clipboard leaned over my shoulder during the coffee phase of dinner and asked whether I wanted to ride in a montgolfiere.
I was a last-minute (read interloping) attendee at a French journalism convention and so far the festivities had been taken up entirely by eating, drinking, smoking, sleeping and drinking.
The man with the clipboard represented a halfhearted attempt to introduce a bit of les sportif into our itinerary.
But as the French embody a Zen-like state of blase when it comes to athletics (try finding a Nautilus machine in Paris), my fellow conventioners were having none of it.
The diners at my table simply lit more Gauloises and scoffed at the suggestion of interrupting a perfectly good Saturday morning to go golfing or even montgolfing (ballooning to you; the brothers Montgolfier, French of course, were the world's first hot-air balloonists).
Back in the U.S.A. this kind of chi-chi airborne activity wins heartwarmingly covetous responses.
As in: "You went ballooning??!!
In France??!!"
Americans it seems have followed Malcolm Forbes's hot-air lead and taken to ballooning in a heady way.
During the past 25 years, the number of balloonists (those who have passed a Federal Aviation Authority lighter-than-air test) have swelled from a couple hundred to several thousand, with some estimates running as high as 10,000.
Some 30 balloon shows are held annually in the U.S., including the world's largest convocation of ersatz Phineas Foggs -- the nine-day Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta that attracts some 800,000 enthusiasts and more than 500 balloons, some of which are fetchingly shaped to resemble Carmen Miranda, Garfield or a 12-story-high condom.
But in Epinal, a gray 16th-century river town adjacent to France's Vosges mountain region, none of these Yankee-come-lately enthusiasms for things aloft was evident.
Ballooning at the de rigueur hour of 6 a.m. held all the attraction for most people of sunrise root-canal work.
Feeling the naggings of a culture imperative, I promptly signed up.
The first thing anybody will tell you about ballooning is that it requires zip in the way of athletic prowess, or even a measure of derring-do.
They will also tell you that even if you hate heights, you can still balloon.
(I still say don't look down.
What they won't tell you is not to go aloft in anything you don't want to get wet.
I'm not referring to the traditional champagne drenching during the back-on-terra-firma toast.
I'm talking about landing in a canal.
In a porous wicker basket.
With a pilot who speaks no English.
To wit, my maiden voyage (and novitiates are referred to as virgins) began at dawn on a dew-sodden fairway and ended at noon in a soggy field.
In between came lots of coffee drinking while watching the balloons inflate and lots of standing around deciding who would fly in what balloon and in what order (the baskets hold no more than four passengers).
When it wasn't my turn in the balloon I followed its progress from the "chase car," listening to the driver holler into a walkie-talkie.
After long stretches of this attendant ground activity came 20 or so lovely minutes of drifting above the Vosges watching the silver mists rise off the river and the French cows amble about the fields.
It's hard not to feel that God's in his heaven with this kind of bird's-eye view of the world, even if your pilote in silly plaid beret kept pointing out how "belle" it all was.
Eventually little French farmers and their little French farmwives came out of their stone houses and put their hands above their tiny eyes and squinted at us.
No wonder.
We were coming down straight into their canal.
See, the other rule of thumb about ballooning is that you can't steer.
And neither can your pilot.
You can go only up or down (by heating the balloon's air with a propane burner, which does make the top of your head feel hot) and ride the air currents.
Which makes the chase car necessary.
Most balloonists seldom go higher than 2,000 feet and most average a leisurely 5-10 miles an hour.
When the balloon is cruising along at a steady altitude there is little sense of motion.
Only when one is ascending -- or in our case descending a tad trop rapidement -- does one feel, well, airborne in a picnic basket.
"What's he doing?" hissed my companion, who was the only other English-speaking member of the convention and whose knuckles were white.
"Attention," yelled our pilot as our basket plunged into the canal.
"You bet attention," I yelled back, leaping atop the propane tanks, "I'm wearing alligator loafers!"
Our pilot simply laughed, fired up the burner and with another blast of flame lifted us, oh, a good 12-inches above the water level.
We scuttled along for a few feet before he plunged us into the drink again.
Eventually we came to rest in a soggy patch of field where we had the exquisite pleasure of scrambling out of the basket into the mud while the French half of our ballooning tag team scrambled in.
I looked at my watch.
Barely half-an-hour aloft.
Back in the chase car, we drove around some more, got stuck in a ditch, enlisted the aid of a local farmer to get out the trailer hitch and pull us out of the ditch.
We finally rendezvoused with our balloon, which had come to rest on a dirt road amid a clutch of Epinalers who watched us disassemble our craft -- another half-an-hour of non-flight activity -- that included the precision routine of yanking the balloon to the ground, punching all the air out of it, rolling it up and cramming it and the basket into the trailer.
It was the most exercise we'd had all morning and it was followed by our driving immediately to the nearest watering hole.
This meant returning to the golf course, where we watched a few French duffers maul the first tee while we sat under Cinzano umbrellas, me nursing an espresso and my ego.
A whole morning of ballooning and I had been off the ground barely 30 minutes.
Still, I figured the event's envy-quotient back in the U.S.A. was near peerless.
As for the ride back to camp, our pilot and all the other French-speaking passengers clambered into the chase car.
My American companion and I were left to ride alfresco in the wicker basket.
As we streaked by a blase gendarme, I couldn't resist rearing up on my soggy loafers and saluting.

Treasury Undersecretary David Mulford defended the Treasury's efforts this fall to drive down the value of the dollar, saying it helped minimize damage from the 190-point drop in the stock market Oct. 13.
Testifying before a House subcommittee, Mr. Mulford said that if the Treasury hadn't intervened in foreign-exchange markets in September and early October to reduce the dollar's value, the plunge in the stock market might have provoked a steep fall in the currency that might have "unhinged financial markets."
Mr. Mulford, responding to critics of intervention, also said intervention is "highly visible," is taken seriously by financial markets and works better than "was recognized some time ago."
Differences between the Treasury and the Federal Reserve on the usefulness of intervention to help restrain the dollar resurfaced at the hearing.
Fed Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson, who had dissented from the Treasury's policy, told lawmakers, "I became convinced about what looked to me like an attempt to push the dollar down against the fundamentals in the market."
Intervention, he added, is useful only to smooth disorderly markets, not to fundamentally influence the dollar's value.
Rep. John LaFalce (D., N.Y.) said Mr. Johnson refused to testify jointly with Mr. Mulford and instead asked to appear after the Treasury official had completed his testimony.
A Fed spokesman denied Mr. LaFalce's statement.
Mr. Mulford said reports of tension between the Treasury and Fed have been exaggerated, insisting that they involved "nuances."
Mr. Johnson also said that "in the scheme of things, these things are minor."
On other matters, Mr. Mulford said West Germany is contributing to imbalances in the world economy because of its success as an exporter.
"The solution is stronger domestic growth {in Germany}," he said.
But because the growth of the German economy has been stronger than expected, Mr. Mulford said, it's difficult for the U.S. to argue that Germany ought to adopt more stimulative monetary and fiscal policies.
Germany's trade surplus is largely with other European countries rather than with the U.S., Mr. Mulford acknowledged.
But nonetheless U.S. companies might be more successful in European markets if not for the German export push, he said.
Five officials of this investment banking firm were elected directors: E. Garrett Bewkes III, a 38-year-old managing director in the mergers and acquisitions department; Michael R. Dabney, 44, a managing director who directs the principal activities group which provides funding for leveraged acquisitions; Richard Harriton, 53, a general partner who heads the correspondent clearing services; Michael Minikes, 46, a general partner who is treasurer; and William J. Montgoris, 42, a general partner who is also senior vice president of finance and chief financial officer.
The board increased by one to 26 members.
In the past year, one inside director resigned, while three others retired.
Some U.S. allies are complaining that President Bush is pushing conventional-arms talks too quickly, creating a risk that negotiators will make errors that could affect the security of Western Europe for years.
Concerns about the pace of the Vienna talks -- which are aimed at the destruction of some 100,000 weapons, as well as major reductions and realignments of troops in central Europe -- also are being registered at the Pentagon.
Mr. Bush has called for an agreement by next September at the latest.
But some American defense officials believe the North Atlantic Treaty Organization should take more time to examine the long-term implications of the options being considered.
For one thing, Pentagon officials, who asked not to be identified, worry that the U.S. will have a much tougher time persuading Europeans to keep some short-range nuclear weapons on their soil once Soviet armored forces are thinned out.
At the same time, they contend that a reduction of NATO forces under a treaty will increase the possibility of a conventional Soviet attack unless the West retains a residual force of nuclear weapons in Europe.
Allies concerned about the deadline include the British, French and smaller NATO allies, some of whom don't have adequate staffs to provide quick answers to the questions being raised by what generally are considered the most complex arms-control talks ever attempted.
So far, no ally has complained openly, preserving the impression that NATO is in line with the Bush position that a quick agreement bringing Soviet conventional forces down to parity with NATO is the West's top bargaining priority.
But even though NATO negotiators have only 10 months left under the Bush timetable, they are still wrestling over such seemingly fundamental questions as "What is a tank?"
Five of the six categories of weapons under negotiation haven't even been defined.
Tanks currently are defined as armored vehicles weighing 25 tons or more that carry large guns.
The Soviets complicated the issue by offering to include light tanks, which are as light as 10 tons.
Oleg A. Grinevsky, the chief Soviet negotiator in the conventional-arms talks, argued that this would mean the Soviets would have to destroy some 1,800 tanks, while the U.S. would lose none because it has no light tanks in Europe.
But the issue is stickier than it seems.
France, Britain and Italy all have light tanks they would like to keep out of the talks.
And some U.S. Army analysts worry that the proposed Soviet redefinition is aimed at blocking the U.S. from developing lighter, more transportable, high-technology tanks.
Defining combat aircraft is even tougher.
The Soviets insisted that aircraft be brought into the talks, then argued for exempting some 4,000 Russian planes because they are "solely defensive."
NATO hasn't budged from its insistence that any gun-carrying plane has offensive capability.
The dispute over that issue, according to one U.S. official, is a "potential treaty stopper," and only President Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev may be able to resolve it.
Accounting problems raise more knotty issues.
Greece and Turkey, for example, are suspected of overstating their arsenals in hopes that they can emerge from the arms-reduction treaty with large remaining forces to deter each other.
Other nations aren't sure how many weapons they have in their own arsenals.
"It's just going to be sloppy, both on our side and theirs {the Warsaw Pact's}," says one NATO analyst.
So far, neither the Bush administration nor arms-control experts in Congress seem moved by arguments that these problems may take more time to thrash out than President Bush has allowed.
They argue that the bigger danger would be that the West would delay action so long that the Soviets might back away from the current conciliatory attitude.
"So what if you miss 50 tanks somewhere?" asks Rep. Norman Dicks (D., Wash.), a member of the House group that visited the talks in Vienna.
"The bottom line is that if we can get that {Warsaw Pact} superiority brought down to parity, we ought to keep pressing ahead as quickly as possible.
I worry more about things becoming so unraveled on the other side that they might become unable to negotiate.
International Lease Finance Corp. announced a leasing contract with charter carrier American Trans Air Inc., in a transaction involving six Boeing Co. 757-200s.
The value of the jets, including spares, is in excess of $250 million.
Two of the 757-200s are new aircraft to be delivered to American Trans Air, the main subsidiary of Amtran Inc., in December 1991 and January 1992.
Four of the planes were purchased by International Lease from Singapore Airlines in a previously announced transaction.
Delivery of the first aircraft is set for early November, a second for December and two for April 1990.
Norway's unemployment rate for October was 3.6%, unchanged from September but up from 2.6% in the same month last year.
The figure excludes a record number employed by extraordinary government work programs, the Labor Directorate announced Tuesday.
Including those in the state programs, there were 143,800 Norwegians, or about 6.5% of the work force, without permanent employment in October, up from September's 136,800.
The number of people registered as jobless at the end of October declined by 900 from September to 78,600.
Those employed in state-funded special programs increased by 7,400 to 65,200 in the same period, the Directorate said.
In October 1988, there were 40,800 fewer employed by government programs.
Coca-Cola Co., aiming to boost soft-drink volume in Singapore, said it is discussing a joint venture with Fraser & Neave Ltd., its bottling franchisee in that country.
The venture would be the latest in Coke's rapid expansion of overseas investment.
So far this year, it has put nearly $700 million into bottling operations in Australia, New Zealand and France.
The move also reflects Coke's eagerness to have a hand in developing the soft-drink markets in Pacific Basin countries.
Aside from Europe, the Pacific division is where Coke will be focusing much of its attention for years to come.
That's because when Coke looks to the Pacific area, it sees an economic and demographic gold mine.
In countries such as Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore, economies are growing, resulting in a rise in disposable income that consumers can use for soft drinks.
And unlike Europe and the U.S., where populations are aging, the Pacific Basin countries have growing proportions of youths -- the heaviest consumers of Coca-Cola and other sodas.
A Coca-Cola spokesman said it is too early to say how the joint venture would be structured, or how much the company would invest in the transaction.
In the past, however, Coke has typically taken a minority stake in such ventures.
By acquiring stakes in bottling companies in the U.S. and overseas, Coke has been able to improve bottlers' efficiency and production, and in some cases, marketing.
Coke has tended to increase its control when results were sluggish in a given country.
That doesn't appear to be the case in Singapore, a country of about three million people with a relatively high soft-drink consumption rate -- a key indicator of Coke's success in a market.
In Singapore, per-capita consumption is about one-third that of the U.S..
And combining Fraser & Neave's own soft drinks with Coca-Cola's gives the Singapore company more than half the share of the soda market there, Coke said.
Fraser & Neave, which also has interests in packaging, beer and dairy products, holds the Coke licenses for Malaysia and Brunei, where per-capita consumption isn't as high as in Singapore.
Coke could be interested in more quickly developing some of the untapped potential in those markets.
A Coke spokesman said he couldn't say whether that is the direction of the talks.
Coke said the joint-venture arrangement, which needs approval from both companies' boards, should be completed early next year.
AMERICAN BRANDS Inc., Old Greenwich, Conn., said it increased its quarterly 11% to 68 cents a share from 61 cents, payable Dec. 1 to stock of record Nov. 10.
The increase follows the company's report of strong earnings for the third quarter, and reflects what American Brands called its "tradition of sharing earnings growth" with shareholders.
American Brands is a consumer products company with core businesses in tobacco, distilled spirits and life insurance.
As of Sept. 30, American Brands had 95.2 million shares outstanding.
Giovanni Agnelli & Co. announced a transaction that will strengthen its indirect control of Fiat S.p. A. and will admit Prince Karim Aga Khan as its first non-family shareholder.
Giovanni Agnelli, a limited partnership that is the master holding company for Fiat's Agnelli family, owns approximately 75% of the shares in Istituto Finanziario Industriale, which in turn owns approximately 40% of Fiat, Italy's biggest private-sector industrial group.
The company said Maria Sole Agnelli Teodorani, sister of Fiat Chairman Giovanni Agnelli, agreed to trade her shares in IFI for new ordinary shares in the limited partnership, which will give her control of 4.67% of Giovanni Agnelli & Co.
The Aga Khan, meanwhile, agreed to trade some of his stake in Luxembourg-based Ifint S.A., another Agnelli family company, for 7.45% of Giovanni Agnelli & Co.'s capital.
His new stake would be in the form of preferred shares, which receive higher dividends but have voting rights only in extraordinary shareholders assemblies.
The Aga Khan owns 10% of Ifint's capital, while IFI owns 23%.
As a result of the transaction, which is expected to be approved at a shareholders meeting Nov. 24, Giovanni Agnelli & Co. will control 79.18% of IFI's ordinary shares.
Its capital will also be raised to 232.4 billion lire ($172.5 million) from the current 204.3 billion lire.
IFI also has nonvoting preferred shares, which are quoted on the Milan stock exchange.
The value of the two transactions wasn't disclosed, but an IFI spokesman said no cash would change hands.
The move strengthens the existing links between the Agnellis and the Aga Khan, the head of the world's Ismaili Moslems who is a longtime family friend and frequently goes sailing with Mr. Agnelli.
Mr. Agnelli and the Aga Khan also have some business ties, and a spokesman for the Agnelli company didn't rule out that the current agreement could lead to further collaboration.
For instance, Ifint earlier this year bought an 18% stake in Alisarda, the Aga Khan's airline, which flies between Italy and Sardinia.
Giovanni Agnelli & Co., which was formed in January 1987 as a way of keeping the Agnellis' controlling stake in Fiat together despite an ever-growing family tree, has been playing a more active role in the Agnelli group of late.
It raised financing of 300 billion lire for the purchase this summer by another Agnelli-related group of the food concern Galbani S.p. A., by selling a chunk of its IFI shares to Mediobanca S.p. A.
Mediobanca said during the weekend that it agreed to sell the shares back to Giovanni Agnelli for 333 billion lire.
Your Oct. 2 page-one article on people riding so-called "railbikes" on railroad tracks was a disservice to your readers.
It unfortunately encourages others to engage in a highly dangerous and illegal activity that only a very few are doing now.
And it treats such activities in a frivolous, cavalier fashion, with total indifference to common sense and public safety.
MCI Communications Corp. said it received a three-year contract valued at more than $15 million to provide network, credit-card and other telecommunications services to Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
Congressional Democrats and the Bush administration agreed on a compromise minimum-wage bill, opening the way for the first wage-floor boost in more than nine years.
The agreement ended a long impasse between the congressional leaders and the White House over the wage issue.
President Bush in June vetoed a measure passed by Congress and said he wouldn't accept any minimum-wage rise that went beyond limits he set early in this year's debate on the issue.
The compromise was a somewhat softened version of what the White House had said it would accept.
Under the agreement with the House and Senate leaders, the minimum wage would rise from the current $3.35 an hour to $4.25 an hour by April 1991.
Employers could also pay a subminimum "training wage" for 90 days to new workers who are up to 19 years old, and then for another 90 days if the company institutes a specific training program for the newcomers.
White House officials were delighted that the compromise includes the concept of a training wage, which Mr. Bush has fought for throughout the year.
"For the first time in history, we have a training wage that will be part" of the nation's labor laws, said Roger Porter, assistant to the president for economic and domestic policy.
White House aides said that although they made a small compromise on the length of a training wage, the final minimum-wage increase will meet the standards set by Mr. Bush.
The bill vetoed by the president in June, which the House failed to override, would have lifted the minimum wage to $4.55 an hour by late 1991, with a training wage for up to two months, generally for a worker's first job.
Mr. Bush had been holding out for a bill boosting the wage floor to $4.25 an hour by the end of 1991, coupled with a six-month training wage for workers newly hired by any employer.
Under the compromise, the $4.25 level would be reached nine months earlier, while the training subminimum would be shorter, unless it is tied to a training plan.
Democrats argued that the training wage was a way of allowing employers to pay less than the minimum wage, while new workers need far less than six months to be trained for their jobs.
Democrats had been negotiating with some Republican congressional leaders on a compromise lately.
With congressional elections next year, GOP leaders have worried about opposing a minimum-wage rise for low-paid workers at a time when Congress is moving toward a capital-gains tax cut that would directly benefit wealthier taxpayers.
Republicans have been imploring the White House to compromise on the wage issue.
In the Senate, Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.), chairman of the Labor Committee, and Pete Domenici, (R., N.M.) ranking minority member of the Budget Committee, have been working on a compromise, and their soundings showed that the Senate appeared to be heading toward enough strength to override another Bush veto, a Democratic staff official said.
The House is scheduled to vote this week on the compromise, as a substitute to a new Democratic bill, itself watered down from last spring's version.
The Senate will probably vote not long afterward.
Some Democrats thought they might have compromised too much.
Rep. Austin Murphy (D., Pa.), chairman of the House labor standards subcommittee, said they might have done better "if we'd held their feet to the fire."
Mr. Kennedy suggested Democrats "yielded a great deal" on the size of the increase, but he cited concessions from the White House on the training wage, which he said make it "less harsh."
With only 16-year-olds to 19-year-olds eligible, 68% of workers getting less than $4.25 an hour, who are adults, won't be subject to the training wage, he said.
The AFL-CIO, which previously opposed the administration's subminimum idea, said the compromise has "adequate safeguards, so the youth are not exploited and older workers are not displaced."

Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it lowered the ratings on about $3.2 billion of Houston Lighting & Power Co.'s securities because of the company's low levels of interest coverage and internal cash generation.
Houston Lighting is a unit of Houston Industries Inc., a utility holding company in Houston.
Downgraded by Moody's were Houston Lighting's first-mortgage bonds and secured pollution-control bonds to single-A-3 from single-A-2; unsecured pollution-control bonds to Baa-1 from single-A-3; preferred stock to single-A-3 from single-A-2; a shelf registration for preferred stock to a preliminary rating of single-A-3 from a preliminary rating of single-A-2; two shelf registrations for collateralized debt securities to a preliminary rating of single-A-3 from a preliminary rating of single-A-2, and the unit's rating for commercial paper to Prime-2 from Prime-1.
Moody's said Houston Lighting's current situation has some positive aspects, including managing "very well" the construction and commercial operation risks of Units 1 and 2 of the South Texas Project nuclear power plant.
Capital requirements will be declining and no new generating facilities will be required for several years, Moody's said.
Scott C. Smith, formerly vice president, finance, and chief financial officer of this media concern, was named senior vice president.
Mr. Smith, 39, retains the title of chief financial officer.
Armstrong World Industries Inc. agreed in principle to sell its carpet operations to Shaw Industries Inc.
The price wasn't disclosed but one analyst estimated that it was $150 million.
Armstrong, which has faced a takeover threat from the Belzberg family of Canada since July, said that disposing of the carpet business would improve "total financial performance."
The move also would allow the company to concentrate on core businesses, which include ceramic tile, floor coverings and furniture.
Moreover, such a sale could help Armstrong reassure its investors and deter the Belzbergs, who own a 9.85% stake in the Lancaster, Pa., company.
Analysts expect Armstrong to use proceeds of the sale to reduce debt, buy back stock or perhaps finance an acquisition.
The carpet division had 1988 sales of $368.3 million, or almost 14% of Armstrong's $2.68 billion total revenue.
The company has been manufacturing carpet since 1967.
Recently it upgraded its plants so that it could make stain-resistant products with higher quality dyes.
For the past year or two, the carpet division's operating profit margins have hovered around 5%, high by industry standards, but disappointing compared with the 13% to 19% margins for two of Armstrong's chief businesses, flooring and building products.
Analysts hailed the planned transaction as being beneficial to Armstrong and Shaw, the market leader in the U.S. carpet industry, with an estimated 17% to 20% share.
Shaw, based in Dalton, Ga., has annual sales of about $1.18 billion, and has economies of scale and lower raw-material costs that are expected to boost the profitability of Armstrong's brands, sold under the Armstrong and Evans-Black names.
Yesterday, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Shaw's shares closed ex-dividend at $26.125, up $2.25.
Armstrong's shares, also listed on the Big Board, closed at $39.125, up 12.5 cents.
Yesterday, Armstrong reported flat earnings for the third quarter and nine months, worsened by the stock dilution of an employee stock ownership plan adopted earlier this year.
For the quarter, earnings were $47 million, or 92 cents a share, including a one-time gain of $5.9 million.
In the year-ago quarter, earnings were $42.9 million, or 93 cents a share.
Yesterday, Armstrong announced an agreement to sell its small Applied Color Systems unit to a subsidiary of the Swiss company, Brauerei Eichof Ltd.
The price wasn't disclosed.
Armstrong expects to close the sale of the color unit in late November and the carpet sale in December, with the gains to be applied to fourth quarter or first-quarter results.
The government's primary economic-forecasting gauge rose a slight 0.2% in September, but economists said the report offered little new information on the degree to which the U.S. economy is slowing.
The small increase in the index of leading indicators, which had climbed 0.5% in August but was unchanged in July, does lend support to the view that the economy has slowed noticeably.
However, it doesn't give much of a clue as to whether a recession is on the horizon.
"I don't think it provides much new information on the economy," said Richard Rippe, economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
So far this year, the index of leading indicators has risen in four months, fallen in four months and remained unchanged in the other month.
In another report yesterday, the Commerce Department said sales of new single-family houses plunged 14% in September to an annual rate of 618,000 from 719,000 in August.
The declines were particularly pronounced in the Northeast and in the South, where Hurricane Hugo was a factor.
Although September's weakness followed two strong months for home sales, the decline supports other indications that the drop in mortgage rates earlier this year has had only a limited beneficial effect on the housing market.
The September drop was the largest since a 19% drop in January 1982, but monthly changes in this measure are even less reliable than those in other economic indicators.
Because the figures are based on a small sample, the department said it is 90% confident only that new-home sales fell somewhere between 5% and 23% during the month.
The department also said it takes four months to establish a trend.
So far this year, 534,000 newly built homes have been sold, down 4.5% from the like months of 1988.
The index of leading indicators got a major boost in September from a surge in consumer expectations as measured by the University of Michigan.
This measure had dropped sharply in August.
The Commerce Department said that as a result of a new adjustment to the formula used to calculate the index, the influence of this component has been reduced.
Of the 11 components to the index, only three others rose in September: the money supply, the length of the average work week and stock prices.
Several components that track the health of the manufacturing sector of the economy turned down in September.
These include new orders for manufactured consumer goods, lead times on vendor deliveries, orders for new plant and equipment, and backlogs of orders for durable goods.
Meanwhile, the National Association of Manufacturers said yesterday a recent poll of 53 executives on its board found that 61% don't expect a recession to occur until 1991 or later.
Although manufacturers often are quick to call for lower interest rates, 60% of the executives said they would prefer that the Fed keep inflation-fighting as its top priority even if that means higher rates.
The other 40% said the Fed ought to worry less about inflation and bring interest rates down.
All the figures are adjusted to remove usual seasonal patterns.
Here are the net contributions of the components of the Commerce Department's index of leading indicators.
After various adjustments, they produced a 0.5% rise in the index for August and a 0.2% rise for September.
September, and the change from August, are: from 1.11 in the previous month.
Boston Edison Co. said it will take a previously reported $60 million charge against earnings in the fourth quarter.
The charge resulted from a settlement approved yesterday by the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities.
As expected, the settlement limits rate increases for three years and ties future charges to customers for operation of the troubled Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station to that plant's performance.
In its order, the state regulatory agency said the company "must be held accountable for the mistakes made in the management of the plant's operation."
Pilgrim had been closed for 32 months.
The average interest rate rose to 8.3875% at Citicorp's $50 million weekly auction of 91-day commercial paper, or corporate IOUs, from 8.337% at last week's sale.
Bids totaling $515 million were submitted.
Accepted bids ranged from 8.38% to 8.395%.
Citicorp also said that the average rate rose to 8.0087% at its $50 million auction of 182-day commercial paper from 7.962% at last week's sale.
Bids totaling $475 million were submitted.
Accepted bids ranged from 8% to 8.019%.
The bank holding company will auction another $50 million in each maturity next Tuesday.
An imaginative novelist writing a thriller about amateur spy-chasing might invent a Clifford Stoll, but it's unlikely.
It's also unnecessary.
Amateur spy-chaser Clifford Stoll is a real person, or as he might waggishly put it, a surreal person.
He is 37, an astronomer with impressive credentials, and something of a genius at making computers do his bidding.
He once described himself as a "Berkeley Hippie," and played the role well; obligatory ragged jeans, a thicket of long hair and rejection of all things conventional, including, for a time at least, formal marriage to his "sweetheart," Martha Matthews.
He also is an entertaining writer, combining wisecracks and wordplay with programmatic detail and lucid explanations of how computers work.
In "The Cuckoo's Egg" (Doubleday, 326 pages, $19.95), he spins a remarkable tale of his efforts over 18 months to catch a computer spy.
The result last spring was the arrest by West German authorities of five young West Germans, accused of stealing information from computers in the U.S. and Europe and selling it to the Soviet KGB.
One of them, 25-year-old Markus Hess of Hannover, allegedly used the international telecommunications network to break into more than 30 high-security computers in the U.S., searching for secrets.
He probably didn't penetrate any top-secret files, but the KGB in East Berlin was willing to pay two of his associates, Peter Carl and Dirk Brezinski, $15,000 for some of the material Hess collected.
They promised yet more for really good stuff.
Mr. Stoll draws his title from the cuckoo's habit of laying eggs in the nests of other birds, making them surrogate parents.
The computer spy had discovered that a popular editing/electronic mail program called Gnu-Emacs could do tricks with the widely used Unix operating system created by AT&T.
Using Gnu-Emacs, the spy could substitute a bogus "atrun" program for the one that routinely cleans up the Unix system every five minutes.
Once his cuckoo's egg was laid, he could enter Unix and become a "super-user," with access to everything.
Mr. Stoll was scanning the heavens at the Keck observatory of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in 1986 when his grant ran low and he was asked to switch to helping run the lab's computers.
He discovered a 75-cent discrepancy in the charges made to various departments for computer time and traced it to a user named "Hunter," who had no valid billing address.
Mr. Stoll suspected the intruder was one of those precocious students who has fun breaking into computers.
But after much tracking, it became evident to Mr. Stoll, through various clues, that the hacker was not on the Berkeley campus or even in California.
Finding him became an obsession for Mr. Stoll.
He made a midnight requisition of all the printers he could lay hands on so that he could monitor all the telephone lines coming into the lab's computers.
After discovering that the hacker had taken over the dormant account of a legitimate user named Joe Sventek, he rigged up an alarm system, including a portable beeper, to alert him when Sventek came on the line.
Some nights he slept under his desk.
His boss complained about neglect of other chores.
The hacker was pawing over the Berkeley files but also using Berkeley and other easily accessible computers as stepping stones to the network of computers used by the military and national security agencies.
The White Sands missile range and CIA contractor Mitre Inc. were among the targets.
When the hacker moved, Mr. Stoll moved too, calling up other systems managers to alert them but keeping his own system open to avoid arousing suspicion.
Sometimes, if the hacker seemed to be into a sensitive file, he would drag his keychain across the terminal to create static or slow the system down to frustrate his quarry.
The FBI initially showed little interest, and he had the impression other federal security agencies were tangled up in legal red tape.
The CIA told him it does not do domestic counterespionage.
One learns a lot from this book, or seems to, about crippling federal bureaucracy.
"Seems to" because it's possible that the CIA and the National Security Agency were more interested than they let on to Mr. Stoll.
Finally, he got help.
Tymnet is a major network linking computers.
One of its international specialists, Steve White, took a quick interest in Mr. Stoll's hunt, ultimately tracing the hacker to West Germany.
The West Germans then took over and finally found Markus Hess.
Eventually, Mr. Stoll was invited to both the CIA and NSA to brief high-ranking officers on computer theft.
He savored the humor of his uncombed appearance among these buttoned-up chaps.
Back in Berkeley, he was violently scolded by a left-wing lady friend for consorting with such people.
He became angry in return.
He had developed a hatred for the hacker and a grudging appreciation of the federal "spooks" who make national security their business.
At several different levels, it's a fascinating tale.

Mips Computer Systems Inc. today will unveil a new general-purpose computer that will compete with more expensive machines from companies such as Sun Microsystems Inc. and Digital Equipment Corp.
The closely held Sunnyvale, Calif., company also will announce an agreement to supply computers to Control Data Corp., which will sell Mips machines under its own label.
The new Mips machine, called the RC6280, will cost $150,000 for a basic system.
The computer processes 55 million instructions per second and uses only one central processing chip, unlike many rival machines using several processors.
The machine employs reduced instruction-set computing, or RISC, technology.
At that price, an analyst familiar with the machine said, the computer offers up to 10 times the performance of similar machines.
"In the price range it's a tremendously high-performing product," said Sandy Gant, an analyst at the market-research firm InfoCorp.
The machine is part of an effort by Mips to establish itself as a supplier of computers, not just of integrated-circuit technology.
Mips also wants to wedge into markets other than traditional RISC applications such as engineering; Mips said the new machine will also be used by businesses and for communications.
"This clearly demonstrates that Mips is a systems company rather than just a chip company," said Mips Vice President John Hime.
The Control Data deal is a boon for Mips because it gives the the five-year-old company one more ally as it battles more established electronic concerns such as Sun, Hewlett-Packard Co., Motorola Inc. and Intel Corp. for the emerging market for RISC machines.
RISC technology speeds up a computer by simplifying the internal software.
For Mips, which expects revenue of $100 million this year, big-name allies such as Control Data are essential to attract software developers to the company's RISC architecture.
"The thing it says about Mips is that they're on a roll right now," said Ms. Gant at InfoCorp.
"They're getting some major wins," she added.
Last month, for example, Mips agreed to supply its computers to Nixdorf Computer AG of West Germany and France's Groupe Bull.
Sony Corp., Tandem Computers Inc. and Digital Equipment have agreed to sell MIPS computers and companies such as Japan's NEC Corp. and West Germany's Siemens A.G. have agreed to make Mips chips under license.
Today's agreement gives Control Data a machine to compete against Digital and other general-purpose computer makers, said John Logan, a computer-market analyst at Aberdeen Group Inc. of Boston.
The machine is essentially a mainframe computer, he said.
"Suddenly CDC (Control Data) has a competitive product to fight back against the VAX9000," a machine Digital announced last month, he added.
Control Data, based in Minneapolis, Minn., expects its sales of Mips systems, including the new RC6280, to amount to more than $100 million by the end of 1991, Mips said.
Nixdorf, Bull and others will also sell versions of the machine, said Mips President Robert Miller.
Mips will start shipping its new machine in the first quarter of 1990, he said.
The machine uses a single processor, which makes it easier to program than competing machines using several processors.
The computer can process 13.3 million calculations called floating-point operations every second.
The machine can run software written for other Mips computers, the company said.
Another fight is brewing between Congress and the Bush administration over how to pay for the savings-and-loan bailout without adding to the federal budget deficit.
In a hearing before the House Ways and Means Committee, the General Accounting Office and the Congressional Budget Office, which both are arms of Congress, advised the new S&L bailout agency to abandon plans to raise temporary working capital through debt issued from an agency that wouldn't be counted on the federal budget.
Officials of the Resolution Trust Corp. have said privately that such a plan was the most likely alternative to raise short-term cash for the bailout.
Instead, the GAO and the Congressional Budget Office said, the RTC should consider using Treasury debt, which is less expensive and subject to oversight by Congress.
The spending could be exempted from meeting deficit-reduction targets in the Gramm-Rudman budget law.
The RTC has projected that it will require between $50 billion to $100 billion in temporary working capital.
The borrowing to raise these funds would be paid off as assets of sick thrifts are sold.
The new S&L law allows the RTC to issue notes for as much as 85% of the value of the assets it holds.
But higher interest rates paid on off-budget debt could add billions to the bailout costs, and wouldn't be subject to congressional scrutiny, Ways and Means members argued.
"To allow this massive level of unfettered federal borrowing without prior congressional approval would be irresponsible," said Rep. Fortney Stark (D., Calif.), who has introduced a bill to limit the RTC's authority to issue debt.
The RTC will have to sell or merge hundreds of insolvent thrifts over the next three years.
The new S&L bailout law allows $50 billion to be spent to sell or merge sick S&Ls and their assets, but that is a net cost.
In the meantime, the agency must raise cash to maintain assets, such as real estate, until they can be sold.
Then the short-term debt is paid off through the proceeds of selling the assets.
David Mullins, assistant secretary of the Treasury, said that the working capital is necessary to reduce the final costs of the bailout, by allowing the agency to sell savings and loans without their bad assets, then hold the assets until they can be sold under favorable conditions.
He said it hasn't yet been determined how the RTC will raise the cash, but the administration doesn't want it to be included on the federal budget, because it would "distort" the budget process by requiring either exemptions from Gramm-Rudman or big increases in the budget deficit.
But the worst possibility would be raising no working capital, he said.
"If working capital financing is not provided," he said, "the RTC may have to slow {S&L sales} or dump acquired assets through fire sales.
Panhandle Eastern Corp. said it applied, on behalf of two of its subsidiaries, to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for permission to build a 352-mile, $273 million pipeline system from Pittsburg County, Okla., to Independence, Miss.
The natural gas pipeline concern said the 500 million cubic feet a day capacity pipeline would be built by a proposed joint venture between two Panhandle Eastern units-Texas Eastern Transmission Corp. and Trunkline Gas Co.
Texas Eastern Transmission will build and operate the system, which will connect the Arkoma Basin with several interstate pipelines.
Now was that a quarter cup or a half cup?
Not a gripping question, unless you're the pastry chef of this city's Chez Panisse restaurant and you've just lost your priceless personal dessert notebook.
Chez Panisse was listed among the top 30 restaurants in the world this year by Connoisseur magazine.
The tattered black binder, bulging with 18 years' worth of recipes held together by rubber bands, was in chef Lindsey Shere's purse when it was stolen from her house recently.
The Berkeley police don't have any leads but doubt the crime was driven by a passion for sweets.
Instead, they figure the culprit probably took money from Ms. Shere's wallet and discarded all the tips in the five-by-eight-inch looseleaf.
Chez Panisse, whose founder, Alice Waters, is considered the inventor of the cooking style known as California cuisine and whose patrons make reservations a month in advance, hasn't exactly subjected diners to vanilla ice cream because of the theft.
For one thing, Ms. Shere can draw on her cookbook, published by Random House four years ago, which is teeming with recipes for such specialties as kiwi sherbet, gooseberry fool (a creamy dish made with crushed stewed berries) and hazelnut "oeufs a la neige."
For another, sympathetic fans have sent Ms. Shere copies of her recipes clipped from magazines over the years.
Still, the restaurant's ever-changing menu of five-course dinners -- it supposedly hasn't repeated a meal since opening in 1971 -- requires constant improvisation.
And that puts added pressure on Chez Panisse dessert-menu planners.
"We make what we know how to make," says business manager Richard Mazzera.
Many in the Bay Area's pastry community express disbelief that Ms. Shere kept only one copy of such valuable notes, but she has received moral support from Baker's Dozen, a group of California pastry chefs that meets regularly to discuss issues like how to keep meringues from weeping and how bovine eating habits affect butter texture.
Ms. Shere has offered a $500 reward for the book's return but figures she'll have to reinvent many recipes from scratch.
"It's an overwhelming job," she says.
"There are so many possible proportions when you consider how many things are made out of eggs and butter and milk.
Newport Electronics Inc. named a new slate of officers, a move that follows replacement of the company's five incumbent directors last week.
Milton B. Hollander, 60 years old, was named chief executive officer, succeeding Barrett B. Weekes.
Mr. Hollander's Stamford, Conn.-based High Technology Holding Co. acquired most of its 49.4% stake in Newport in August.
Mr. Hollander was named chairman last week, succeeding Mr. Weekes, who was among the ousted directors.
The company has declined requests to discuss the changes, but Mr. Weekes has said that Mr. Hollander wanted to have his own team.
Scott Wakeman was named president and chief operating officer of U.S. operations, titles that had been held by Mr. Weekes.
Mr. Wakeman was vice president of the instrument and controls division of closely held Omega Engineering Inc., another company controlled by Mr. Hollander.
A company spokesman didn't know Mr. Wakeman's age.
James R. Lees, 51, vice president of Newport's European operations, was named executive vice president and chief operating officer of European operations, assuming some former duties of Mr. Weekes.
Arthur B. Crozier, 34, an attorney, was named secretary, succeeding John Virtue, who was another of the ousted directors.
UNIFIRST Corp. declared a 2-for-1 stock split.
The Wilmington, Mass., garment service company also boosted its quarterly dividend 20% to three cents a share adjusted for the split.
The dividend had been five cents a share.
The split and quarterly dividend will be payable Jan. 3 to stock of record Nov. 16, the company said.
The split will raise the number of shares outstanding to about 10.2 million.
Separately, UniFirst reported that net income rose 21% to $3 million, or 29 cents a share adjusted for the split, for the fourth quarter ended Aug. 26.
A year earlier UniFirst earned $2.4 million, or 24 cents a share adjusted for the split.
Sales rose to $52.4 million from $50.1 million.
Fibreboard Corp. said it completed the previously reported sale of approximately 27,500 acres of timberland near Truckee, Calif., to closely held Sierra Pacific Industries Corp., Arcata, Calif., for $32.5 million.
The lumber, insulation and fireproofing concern said the transaction, which includes a swap of other timber interests, would result in a $13.5 million after-tax gain, to be recorded in the fourth quarter.
Healthcare International Inc. said it reached a 120-day standstill agreement with its HealthVest affiliate calling for Healthcare to pay HealthVest $5 million right away and additional amounts in the future.
Under the agreement, Healthcare, a manager of health-care facilities, said it would pay HealthVest $3.9 million in overdue rent and mortgage payments and repay $1.1 million in funds that HealthVest advanced for construction work on facilities.
In return, HealthVest agreed that it won't exercise its rights and remedies against Healthcare during the 120-day period.
After the payment, Healthcare still will be $6.5 million in arrears on rent and mortgage payments to HealthVest, a real estate investment trust whose portfolio consists largely of properties operated by Healthcare.
Healthcare has given HealthVest a 12% note for that overdue amount, to be repaid over three years.
In addition, Healthcare agreed to make monthly rent and mortgage payments of $2.7 million to $3 million to HealthVest during the standstill period, to be paid when Healthcare successfully completes asset sales.
Because Healthcare actually owes HealthVest $4.2 million in rent and mortgage payments each month, the amount due above the amount paid will be added to the three-year note.
The funds should help ease a cash bind at HealthVest, which has been unable to pay its debts because Healthcare hasn't made complete rent and mortgage payments since July.
A spokesman said HealthVest has paid two of the three banks it owed interest to in October and is in negotiations with the third bank.
Healthcare, which has been in a severe liquidity bind, said it is able to make the payments because it completed a transaction with Greenery Rehabilitation Group Inc. in which Greenery purchased stock and warrants for $500,000 and loaned Healthcare $9 million.
The loan is backed by Healthcare's 5.4% stake in HealthVest and interest in certain facilities.
I was pleased to note that your Oct. 23 Centennial Journal item recognized the money-fund concept as one of the significant events of the past century.
Actually, about two years ago, the Journal listed the creation of the money fund as one of the 10 most significant events in the world of finance in the 20th century.
But the Reserve Fund, America's first money fund, was not named, nor were the creators of the money-fund concept, Harry Brown and myself.
We innovated telephone redemptions, daily dividends, total elimination of share certificates and the constant $1 pershare pricing, all of which were painfully thought out and not the result of some inadvertence on the part of the SEC.
The crowning moment in the career of Joseph F. O'Kicki came as 300 local and state dignitaries packed into his elegant, marble-columned courtroom here last year for his swearing in as President Judge of Cambria County.
Baskets of roses and potted palms adorned his bench.
The local American Legion color guard led the way.
As the judge marched down the center aisle in his flowing black robe, he was heralded by a trumpet fanfare.
To many, it was a ceremony more befitting a king than a rural judge seated in the isolated foothills of the southern Allegheny Mountains.
But then Judge O'Kicki often behaved like a man who would be king -- and, some say, an arrogant and abusive one.
While his case may be extreme, it reflects the vulnerability of many small communities to domineering judges.
Last March, nine months after the judge's swearing-in, the state attorney general's office indicted him on a sweeping array of charges alleging more than 10 years of "official oppression" in Cambria County, a depressed steel and mining community in western Pennsylvania.
The allegations, ranging from theft and bribery to coercion and lewdness, paint a disquieting picture.
According to testimony in a public, 80-page grand-jury report handed up to the state attorney general, Judge O'Kicki extorted cash from lawyers, muscled favorable loans from banks and bullied local businesses for more than a decade.
Prosecutors, in an indictment based on the grand jury's report, maintain that at various times since 1975, he owned a secret and illegal interest in a beer distributorship; plotted hidden ownership interests in real estate that presented an alleged conflict of interest; set up a dummy corporation to buy a car and obtain insurance for his former girlfriend (now his second wife); and maintained 54 accounts in six banks in Cambria County.
In testimony recorded in the grand jury report, court employees said the judge, now 59 years old, harassed his secretaries, made imperial demands on his staff and hounded anyone who crossed him.
Bailiffs claimed they were required to chauffeur him to and from work, mow his lawn, chop his wood, fix his car and even drop by his house to feed his two grown mutts, Dixie and Husky.
One former bailiff charged that the judge double-crossed him by reneging on a promise of a better paying job after pocketing a $500 bribe.
Some of the allegations are simply bizarre.
Two former secretaries told the grand jury they were summoned to the judge's chambers on separate occasions to take dictation, only to find the judge in his bikini underwear.
One secretary testified that the judge once called her to his office while wearing nothing at all.
The judge, suspended from his bench pending his trial, which began this week, vehemently denies all the allegations against him, calling them "ludicrous" and "imaginative, political demagoguery."
He blames the indictment on local political feuding, unhappiness with his aggressive efforts to clear the courthouse's docket and a vendetta by state investigators and prosecutors angered by some of his rulings against them.
"I don't know whose toes I've stepped on," says the judge.
"I'll find out, eventually, who pushed the state police buttons into action."
Even if only some of the allegations stand up, however, they provide ample testimony to the awesome power of judges in rural communities.
That power can sometimes be abused, particularly since jurists in smaller jurisdictions operate without many of the restraints that serve as corrective measures in urban areas.
Lawyers and their clients who frequently bring business to a country courthouse can expect to appear before the same judge year after year.
Fear of alienating that judge is pervasive, says Maurice Geiger, founder and director of the Rural Justice Center in Montpelier, Vt., a public interest group that researches rural justice issues.
As a result, says Mr. Geiger, lawyers think twice before appealing a judge's ruling, are reluctant to mount, or even support, challenges against him for re-election and are usually loath to file complaints that might impugn a judge's integrity.
Judge O'Kicki, a stern and forbidding-looking man, has been a fixture in the local legal community for more than two decades.
The son of an immigrant stonemason of Slovenian descent, he was raised in a small borough outside Ebensburg, the Cambria County seat, and put himself through the University of Pittsburgh Law School.
He graduated near the top of his class, serving on the school law review with Richard Thornburgh, who went on to become governor of Pennsylvania and, now, U.S. Attorney General.
It was also in law school that Mr. O'Kicki and his first wife had the first of seven daughters.
He divorced his first wife three years ago and married the daughter of his court clerk.
Last year, Pennsylvania Supreme Court Justice John P. Flaherty called Mr. O'Kicki one of the finest judges "not only in Pennsylvania but in the United States."
Clearly, the judge has had his share of accomplishments.
After practicing law locally, he was elected to his first 10-year term as judge in 1971; in 1981, he was effectively re-elected.
Six years ago, Judge O'Kicki was voted president of the Pennsylvania Conference of State Trial Judges by the state's 400 judges.
He has been considered several times for appointments to federal district and appellate court vacancies in Pennsylvania.
And when he ran unsuccessfully for a state appellate court seat in 1983, the Pennsylvania Bar Association rated him "one of the best available," after interviewing local lawyers.
"He probably was the smartest guy who ever sat on our bench," says a former president of Cambria County's 150-member bar association, who, like most lawyers in Cambria County, refuses to talk about the judge publicly.
"He's sharp as a tack.
He could grasp an issue with the blink of an eye."
For more than a decade, virtually no one complained about Judge O'Kicki.
"What about those institutions that are supposed to be the bedrock of society, the banks and the bar association...?" wrote a columnist for the Tribune-Democrat, a newspaper in nearby Johnstown, shortly after the scandal became public.
"If only a banker or a lawyer had spoken out years ago, the judicial process wouldn't be under the taint it is today."
Officials with the Pennsylvania Judicial Inquiry and Review Board, the arm of the state that investigates judicial misconduct, counter that they had no inkling of anything amiss in Ebensburg.
"Nobody told us; nobody called us," says an official close to the case who asked not to be named.
"Nobody had the guts to complain."
Certainly not the lawyers.
Johnstown attorney Richard J. Green Jr. shelled out $500 in loans to the judge over five years, he said in testimony to the grand jury.
"The judge never made a pretense of repaying the money," said Mr. Green.
Eventually, Mr. Green testified, he began ducking out of his office rather than face the judge when he visited.
When Mr. Green won a $240,000 verdict in a land condemnation case against the state in June 1983, he says Judge O'Kicki unexpectedly awarded him an additional $100,000.
Mr. Green thought little of it, he told the grand jury, until the judge walked up to him after the courtroom had cleared and suggested a kickback.
"Don't you think I ought to get a commission... or part of your fee in this case?" Mr. Green said the judge asked him.
Appalled, Mr. Green never paid the money, he testified.
But he didn't complain to the state's Judicial Inquiry and Review Board, either, saying later that he feared retribution.
Mr. O'Kicki said he will respond to Mr. Green's allegation at his trial.
Like most of Cambria County's lawyers and residents who had dealings with the judge, Mr. Green declined to be interviewed for this article.
And no one with a complaint about the judge would allow his name to be printed.
"I don't have anything much to say, and I think that's what you're going to find from everyone else you talk to up here," says local attorney Edward F. Peduzzi.
Says another lawyer: "The practice of law is a matter of biting one's lip when you live in a small community.
One had best not dance on top of a coffin until the lid is sealed tightly shut."
The judge was considered imperious, abrasive and ambitious, those who practiced before him say.
He sipped tea sweetened with honey from his high-backed leather chair at his bench, while scribbling notes ordering spectators to stop whispering or to take off their hats in his courtroom.
Four years ago, he jailed all nine members of the Cambria County School Board for several hours after they defied his order to extend the school year by several weeks to make up for time lost during a teachers' strike.
Visitors in his chambers say he could cite precisely the years, months, weeks and days remaining until mandatory retirement would force aside the presiding president judge, giving Judge O'Kicki the seniority required to take over as the county's top court administrator.
The judge, they say, was fiercely proud of his abilities and accomplishments.
"My name is judge," Judge O'Kicki told a car salesman in Ebensburg when he bought a new red Pontiac Sunbird in October 1984, according to the grand-jury report.
The dealership dutifully recorded the sale under the name "Judge O'Kicki."
Yet, despite the judge's imperial bearing, no one ever had reason to suspect possible wrongdoing, says John Bognato, president of Cambria County's 150-member bar association.
"The arrogance of a judge, his demeanor, the way he handles people are not a basis for filing a complaint," says Mr. Bognato.
"Until this came up and hit the press, there was never any indication that he was doing anything wrong."
State investigators dispute that view now, particularly in light of the judge's various business dealings in Cambria County.
The judge came under scrutiny in late 1987, after the state attorney general's office launched an unrelated investigation into corruption in Cambria County.
The inquiry soon focused on the judge.
Even his routine business transactions caused trouble, according to the grand jury report.
When the judge bought his new Sunbird from James E. Black Pontiac-Cadillac in Ebensburg five years ago, the dealership had "certain apprehensions" about the judge's reputation, according to the grand-jury report.
The dealership took the extra step of having all the paper work for the transaction pre-approved by Ebensburg's local lender, Laurel Bank.
Then, as an additional precaution, the car dealership took the judge's photograph as he stood next to his new car with sales papers in hand -- proof that he had received the loan documents.
But when the judge received his payment book, he disavowed the deal.
"There was no loan, there is no loan, there never shall be a loan," the judge wrote the bank on his judicial stationery, according to the report.
Later, the judge went a step farther.
After Laurel Bank tried to repossess the car, a vice president asked him to intervene in an unrelated legal dispute involving a trust account.
The judge wrote again.
"I find myself in an adversary relationship with Laurel Bank, and I am not inclined to extend myself as far as any favors are concerned," the judge wrote back in a letter attached to the grand jury's report.
"Perhaps if my personal matters can be resolved with Laurel bank in the near future, I may be inclined to reconsider your request...."
The judge now says it was "unfortunate" that he chose to write the letter but says "there was certainly no intent to extort there."
The bank acquiesced.
It refinanced the judge's loan, lowered its interest rate and accepted a trade-in that hadn't originally been part of the deal -- a beat up 1981 Chevy Citation the dealer had to repair before it could be resold.
The incident wasn't the only time the judge got special treatment from his local bank.
Two years later, he wrote to complain that the interest he was paying on an unsecured $10,000 loan was "absolutely onerous."
Paul L. Kane, Laurel's president at the time, quickly responded.
The bank, he wrote back, was "immediately" lowering the rate by 3.5%, "as a concession to you."
The judge says he can't discuss in detail how he will defend himself at his trial, although he contends that if he were as corrupt as state prosecutors believe, he would be far wealthier than he is.
His seven-bedroom cedar and brick house outside of Johnstown is up for sale to pay for his lawyers.
The judge says he is confident he will return to his old bench.
Already, he notes, the 76 charges originally filed against him have been trimmed to 27.
Most of the allegations no longer pending were ethics charges withdrawn by state prosecutors as part of a pre-trial agreement.
The heart of the case -- "official oppression" -- remains intact.
"If I lose, I lose my position, my career, my pension, my home and my investments," says the judge.
"My God and I know I am correct and innocent.
Many thanks for Alexander Cockburn's comic masterpiece ("U.S.. Economy: A House Built on Junk-Bond Sand," Viewpoint, Oct. 19).
The use of the abominable construction practices in the Soviet Union -- as evidenced by the collapse of sand apartment blocks during the Armenian earthquake -- as a metaphor for the U.S. economic system was a sublime example of Mr. Cockburn's satirical muse.
I await his sequel: the economic and social resiliency of the San Francisco Bay area and the outstanding work of the local governments and the private charitable organizations there as metaphors for the supremacy of whatever failed system Mr. Cockburn now believes in.
It should be a scream.
As a money manager and a grass-roots environmentalist, I was very disappointed to read in the premiere issue of Garbage that The Wall Street Journal uses 220,000 metric tons of newsprint each year, but that only 1.4% of it comes from recycled paper.
By contrast, the Los Angeles Times, for example, uses 83% recycled paper.
With newspapers being the largest single component of solid waste in our landfills, and with our country overflowing with trash, all sectors of our society and all types of businesses must become more responsible in our use and disposal of precious natural resources.
The Wall Street Journal is an excellent publication that I enjoy reading (and must read) daily.
Please make me and thousands of other readers more comfortable with our daily purchase of your newspaper by raising your environmental standards to your overall impeccable quality levels, and increase your use of recycled paper.

EG&G Inc. said it acquired Laboratorium Prof. Dr. Berthold, a German maker of scientific instruments.
Terms weren't disclosed.
The Wellesley, Mass., maker of scientific instruments and electronic parts said Berthold expects 1989 sales of more than 100 million Deutsche marks ($54.5 million) and employs about 400 people.
Berthold is based in Wildbad, West Germany, and also has operations in Belgium.
John M. Kucharski, EG&G's chairman and chief executive, said the acquisition "will extend EG&G's core technologies, strengthen its position in the European Economic Community and assure a strength and presence in the Eastern European market."
He said it especially will strengthen the company's efforts in the rapidly growing field of bio-analytical instrumentation, and in applied nuclear physics.
Separately, EG&G said it sold most of its Mason Research Institute subsidiary to Transgenic Sciences Inc., a closely held biotechnology company based in Worcester, Mass.
The sale, for $7 million in cash and securities, will leave EG&G with a 12% stake in Transgenic, executives said.
Mason is the largest toxicology lab in New England, with annual revenue of $8 million and 140 employees.
Mason serves commercial and government customers, including the National Institutes of Health.
The combined companies will become profitable by January 1990, said James P. Sherblom, Transgenic's chairman and chief executive officer.
The Internal Revenue Service said it is willing to let the U.S. Tax Court decide how much oil man William Herbert Hunt will owe the government after his assets are liquidated.
The surprise announcement came after the IRS broke off negotiations with Mr. Hunt on a settlement of the one-time tycoon's personal bankruptcy case.
Although the action removes one obstacle in the way of an overall settlement to the case, it also means that Mr. Hunt could be stripped of virtually all of his assets if the Tax Court rules against him in a 1982 case heard earlier this year in Washington, D.C.
The IRS has been seeking more than $300 million in back taxes from Mr. Hunt.
Separately, a federal judge hearing Mr. Hunt's bankruptcy case yesterday turned down a proposed $65.7 million settlement between Mr. Hunt and Minpeco S.A., another major creditor in the case.
The Peruvian minerals concern had been seeking a claim of $251 million against Mr. Hunt.
In addition to turning down the compromise, Judge Harold C. Abramson said he would allow a claim of only $19.7 million.
Minpeco attorneys said they would appeal the decision to a federal district court.
Regarding Mr. Hunt's taxes, he and the IRS have apparently agreed on a basic formula for liquidating his estate in which the IRS would get 70% of the proceeds from a liquidating trust and 30% would go to other creditors.
But they have been at odds over how much Mr. Hunt would owe the government after his assets are sold.
The IRS had demanded $90 million but Mr. Hunt would agree to no more than $60 million.
Grover Hartt III, a government lawyer, warned that Mr. Hunt stood to lose certain oil and gas properties, $200,000 in English pottery, a Colorado condominium and other assets he might have kept if he had settled with the IRS.
"But they wanted to roll the dice and we're going to let them," Mr. Hartt said.
Stephen McCartin, Mr. Hunt's attorney, said his client welcomed the gamble.
The Tax Court isn't expected to rule before early next year.
Japan has found another safe outlet for its money: U.S. home mortgages.
An increasing number of big Japanese investors are buying up U.S. home mortgages that have been pooled and packaged for sale as interest-bearing instruments known as mortgage-backed securities.
As much as 10% of new U.S. mortgage securities issued by the Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae, and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., or Freddie Mac, now flow into Japanese hands.
That may not come as a surprise to Americans who have watched the Japanese snap up properties in the U.S. from golf courses to a stake in Rockefeller Center.
But it marks a big change for the Japanese, who shunned mortgage securities after getting burned by a big downturn in interest rates a few years back.
"You can't say it's a "tsunami" (tidal wave), but we're making some headway," says Fannie Mae's chairman, David O. Maxwell, who visits Tokyo at least once a year to explain and drum up investor interest in mortgage securities.
"Interest is a great deal higher than it was a year ago."
The steady growth of the mortgage securities market in the U.S. has even triggered talk of building up a similar market here.
Evidence of the growing Japanese demand for mortgage securities abounds.
Earlier this year, Blackstone Group, a New York investment bank, had no trouble selling out a special $570 million mortgage-securities trust it created for Japanese investors.
Industrial Bank of Japan, which claims to be the biggest Japanese buyer of U.S. mortgage securities, says it will more than double its purchases this year, to an amount one official puts at several billion dollars.
And a Fannie Mae seminar this week promises to draw hundreds of prospective investors, who can be expected to channel tens of billions of dollars into the market in the next few years.
"Last year, there were only several big investors who were interested," says Kinji Kato, a vice president at the international arm of Nomura Securities Co.
"This year, some investors are changing their policies and investing a lot."
Ultimately, he says, strong demand could help to drive down interest rates on mortgage securities.
At the moment, Nomura is the only Japanese institution authorized to act as a primary seller of Fannie Mae instruments.
But other Japanese institutions say privately that they are considering asking to join the 59-dealer selling group.
These securities are attractive to Japanese investors for three reasons.
First, they are safe.
While they aren't backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, as Treasury bonds are, it is widely assumed that the government would support them if necessary.
(U.S. Treasury bonds are still the dollar-denominated investment of choice for long-term Japanese investors).
Second, they are liquid.
The secondary market in federally backed mortgage securities now exceeds $900 billion, or nearly half of the $2.2 trillion in U.S. residential mortgages issued.
Third, they offer high yields.
At the moment, some offer as much as 1.6 to 1.8 percentage points over Treasury securities of similar maturities.
But there is a risk, which the Japanese discovered when they first dipped their toes into the market nearly five years ago.
Since most mortgages can be prepaid or refinanced at any time, issuers of mortgage securities retain the right to buy back their bonds before maturity.
That's a headache for long-term investors, since it forces them to reinvest their money -- usually at lower rates than the original mortgage securities carried.
"Two or three years ago, the problem was that people didn't understand the prepayment risk," says Nomura's Mr. Kato.
"So they were surprised and very disappointed by prepayment."
Compounding the trouble to Japanese investors, mortgage securities pay interest monthly, since most mortgages require homeowners to make monthly payments.
But Japanese institutional investors are used to quarterly or semiannual payments on their investments, so the monthly cash flow posed administrative problems.
As a result, Japanese investors steered clear of the mortgage securities.
But they didn't lose touch with the U.S. issuers.
Since 1985, Japanese investors have bought nearly 80% of $10 billion in Fannie Mae corporate debt issued to foreigners, money that Fannie Mae uses to buy mortgages from U.S. banks.
And Japanese investors took up nearly all of two $200 million Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduits, a kind of collateralized mortgage obligation, that were offered to foreigners this year.
In addition, further packaging of mortgage-backed securities, such as Blackstone's fund, have reduced the effects of prepayment risk and automatically reinvest monthly payments so institutions don't have to.
Freddie Mac for years has offered a so-called participation certificate that guarantees it won't be prepaid for a set number of years and offers semiannual payments.
As Georgia-Pacific's bid for Great Northern Nekoosa has shown, uninvited takeovers are still alive despite premature reports of their demise.
Therefore, the debate about poison pills will continue to rage in the boardrooms of corporations and the halls of academia.
Although poison pills come in different colors and shapes, they usually give current shareholders the right to buy more stock of their corporation at a large discount if certain events occur -- typically, if a hostile bidder acquires more than a specified percentage of the corporation's stock.
However, these discount purchase rights may generally be redeemed at a nominal cost by the corporation's directors if they approve of a bidder.
Supporters of poison pills argue that their adoption forces bidders to negotiate with a corporation's directors, who are thereby put in a better position to pursue the long-term interests of the corporation.
Recent studies by Georgeson & Co. conclude that corporations with poison pills have experienced greater stock-price appreciation than corporations without poison pills during the past few years.
Critics of poison pills argue that they harm shareholders by letting corporate management defeat takeover bids at premium prices and by deterring premium bids from ever being made to shareholders.
These critics are backed by several academic studies showing that the adoption of poison pills reduces shareholder values not merely in the short run, but also over longer periods.
Institutional investors that must evaluate poison pills on a regular basis are interested less in this general debate than in the answers to specific questions about the corporation issuing the pill.
Does this corporation have a high-quality management team with a good track record?
Does this team have a viable strategy for improving shareholder values, and does this strategy require implementation over an extended period?
Will the adoption of this particular form of a poison pill significantly improve the chances for management to carry out this strategy?
If the answers to these questions are affirmative, then institutional investors are likely to be favorably disposed toward a specific poison pill.
However, the problem is that once most poison pills are adopted, they survive forever.
Although the current management team may be outstanding, who will be the CEO in 10 years?
Although the five-year strategy may be excellent, what will be the strategy in 25 years?
The solution to this problem is a time-limited poison pill.
The limit could range from three years to seven years, depending on the composition of the management team and the nature of its strategic plan.
At the end of this period, the poison pill would be eliminated automatically, unless a new poison pill were approved by the then-current shareholders, who would have an opportunity to evaluate the corporation's strategy and management team at that time.
One rare example of a time-limited poison pill is the shareholder rights plan adopted by Pennzoil last year after it received a huge litigation settlement from Texaco.
Pennzoil's poison pill covers five years in order to give current management enough time to put these proceeds to work in a prudent manner.
Another interesting example is the poison pill adopted recently by Pittsburgh-based National Intergroup Inc., a diversified holding company.
The State of Wisconsin Investment Board, which owned about 7% of the company's voting stock, worked with management to devise a time-limited poison pill.
This pill automatically expires after three years unless continued by a vote of the shareholders.
The attitude of the Wisconsin Investment Board reflects a growing receptivity to time-limited poison pills on the part of institutional investors, as shown by the discussions at recent meetings of the Council of Institutional Investors and my informal survey of several retirement plans with large stock positions.
More widespread time limits on poison pills would allow shareholders to evaluate a specific poison pill within the context of a specific management team's strategy.
Such concrete analysis is likely to lead to more fruitful dialogue between management and shareholders than the abstract debate about poison pills.
Mr. Pozen is the general counsel and a managing director of Fidelity Investments in Boston.
Michael Blair, former president and chief executive officer of Enfield Corp., failed to win election to the company's board at a special shareholder meeting.
Mr. Blair said after the meeting that he had filed separate lawsuits in the Ontario Supreme Court for unjust dismissal against Enfield and for libel against its largest shareholder, Canadian Express Ltd., and two executives of Hees International Bancorp Inc., which controls Canadian Express.
Holders at the meeting elected a full slate of Canadian Express nominees to Enfield's 11-member board.
Mr. Blair and Hees have been feuding for months.
Yesterday's election was a sequel to Enfield's annual meeting in June when Mr. Blair disallowed proxies in favor of two Hees nominees.
The Ontario Supreme Court overturned Mr. Blair's decision.
He later resigned from his executive positions with Enfield, saying that actions by its board "amounted to {my} dismissal."
Mr. Blair said his libel suit seeks 10 million Canadian dollars (US$ 8.5 million) from Canadian Express and Hees executives Manfred Walt and Willard L'Heureux.
He said his suit against Enfield seeks two years severance pay, equivalent to C$ 720,000.
Hees and Canadian Express executives couldn't be reached for comment.
Enfield is a holding company with interests in manufacturing concerns.
It is 38.5% owned by Canadian Express, another holding company.
Hees is a merchant bank controlled by Toronto financiers Peter and Edward Bronfman.
All the concerns are based in Toronto.
Buying 51% of Rockefeller Group Inc. is right up Mitsubishi Estate Co.'s alley in one sense: The huge Japanese real estate company is entering a long-term relationship with a similarly conservative U.S. owner of tony urban property.
But in another sense, the $846 million purchase is uncharacteristically nervy, industry analysts say.
The usually cautious giant will become the majority owner of the company that owns New York's beloved Rockefeller Center at a time when tensions over Japanese purchases of U.S. property are at an all-time high.
Officials of Rockefeller Group and Mitsubishi Estate prefer to focus on the affinities, nearly dismissing the threat of a backlash from the U.S. public.
"We think there will be positive as well as negative reactions," says Raymond Pettit, senior vice president and chief financial officer of Rockefeller Group.
"On balance, we think it will be positive."
But some Japanese government officials and businessmen worry that the prominent purchase is just the sort of deal that should be avoided for the time being.
In particular, they criticize the timing, coming as it does on the heels of Sony Corp.'s controversial purchase of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.
"Officially, yes, we encourage the free flow of direct investment," says a Foreign Ministry official.
"But they didn't have to choose this particular moment."
Since the mid-1980s, Japan's other major real estate purchases in the U.S. include Dai-Ichi Seimei America Corp.'s $670 million purchase of an office building at 153 East 53rd St. in Manhattan in 1987 and Mitsui Fudosan Inc.'s $610 million purchase of the Exxon Building, part of Rockefeller Center, in 1986.
In Los Angeles, Arco Plaza was sold to Shuwa Corp. for $620 million in 1986, and Sumitomo Life Insurance Co. paid $300 million for Atlanta's IBM Tower last year.
Altogether, annual Japanese investment in U.S. commercial real estate grew from about $1.3 billion in 1985 to about $7.1 billion in 1988.
Many Japanese companies have taken the warnings by the country's leaders to heart and sought development partnerships rather than landmark properties.
Critics say Mitsubishi Estate's decision to buy into Rockefeller reflects the degree to which companies are irritated by the pressure to act for the good of Japan.
"Those who have no money and aren't buying think it's right to refrain, but those with money who want to buy for themselves pay no attention," says an official of the Japan-U.S. Business Council.
But to Mitsubishi Estate, the acquisition has just the elements that should win support from both sides.
First of all, it is a friendly acquisition in which Rockefeller sought out Mitsubishi Estate and asked it to buy a majority share.
Secondly, the two companies found a similarity in their business and development philosophies and intend to cooperate in a range of activities from real estate to telecommunications.
Finally, Mitsubishi Estate has no plans to interfere with Rockefeller's management beyond taking a place on the board.
"We'll continue to work with them, in keeping with the reputation of the company, and we'll rely very much on their leadership," says Mitsubishi Estate President Jotaro Takagi.
Rockefeller may well have found its match in Mitsubishi Estate, a company of long history, strong government ties and sound resources.
In asset terms, Mitsubishi Estate is the largest real estate firm in Japan.
The core of its holdings is 190,000 square meters of incredibly expensive property in the Marunouchi district, the business and financial center of Tokyo, often jokingly called "Mitsubishi Village."
The Mitsubishi family company acquired that property from the government some 100 years ago when it was a portion of samurai residential land running from the moat of the Imperial Palace east toward the hodgepodge of tiny shops and twisted alleys that made up the merchants' district.
At the time, Japan had just opened its doors to the world after about 250 years of isolation and needed a Western-style business center.
Mitsubishi built the government's dream development, the story goes, in exchange for the official decision to locate Tokyo's central railway station there.
That was just an early step in a relationship with government that has earned the Mitsubishi group the dubious moniker of "seisho," literally government-business, a title that has the pejorative connotation of doing the government's bidding, but also suggests the clout inherent in maintaining such close ties.
Mitsubishi Estate is one of the dozens of companies in today's Mitsubishi group.
It's known for its cautiousness in part because it has had little need for bold overseas ventures: In the year ended March 31, 57.4% of its total revenue came from office building management.
Its earnings can rise 10% to 12% annually simply from the natural turnover of tenants and automatic rent increases, says Graeme McDonald, an industry analyst at James Capel Pacific Ltd.
For the latest fiscal year, the company's net income jumped a robust 19% to 35.5 billion yen ($250.2 million).
For Mitsubishi Estate, the Rockefeller purchase will catapult it firmly into the overseas real estate business, the one area where it has lagged notably behind Japanese competitors such as Mitsui, which had purchased the Exxon Building.
"Japanese companies need to invest in overseas real estate for diversification," says Yoshio Shima, an industry analyst at Goldman Sachs (Japan) Corp.
Rockefeller isn't the first overseas purchase for Mitsubishi Estate -- it has already played a leading role in designing Los Angeles's Citicorp Plaza.
But the Rockefeller investment is its largest.
Nonetheless, it will barely make a dent in Mitsubishi Estate's finances, analysts say.
Mitsubishi Estate hasn't decided how it will raise the funds for the purchase, which are due in cash next April, but the Marunouchi holdings alone are estimated to have a market value of as much as 10 trillion yen to 11 trillion yen.
Moreover, as a member of the Mitsubishi group, which is headed by one of Japan's largest banks, it is sure to win a favorable loan.
Analysts say the company also could easily issue new convertible bonds or warrants.
Meanwhile, at home, Mitsubishi has control of some major projects.
It is the largest private-sector landowner of the Minato-Mirai 21 project, a multibillion-yen development in the port city of Yokohama, about an hour outside Tokyo.
The project is one of a select group of public projects opened to U.S. firms under a U.S.-Japan construction trade agreement reached last year.
The centerpiece of that complex, the Landmark Tower, will be Japan's tallest building when it is completed in 1993.
Mitsubishi is also pushing ahead with a controversial plan to redevelop Marunouchi into a business center of high-tech buildings, a project budgeted for 30 years and six trillion yen.
Time Warner Inc. and Sony Corp. may be today's public enemies, but the two entertainment giants could end up becoming partners in a number of ventures as part of a settlement of their acrimonious legal dispute over Hollywood producers Peter Guber and Jon Peters.
The Warner Bros. studio and Sony signaled they are close to a settlement yesterday, asking a Los Angeles Superior Court to postpone a hearing scheduled for tomorrow on Warner's request for a preliminary injunction blocking Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters from taking the top posts at Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.
In separate statements, the two sides said they want to have "further discussions."
Sony is acquiring Columbia and Guber-Peters Entertainment Co. in two separate transactions valued at more than $5 billion.
Warner Communications Inc., which is being acquired by Time Warner, has filed a $1 billion breach-of-contract suit against Sony and the two producers.
Warner has a five-year exclusive contract with Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters that requires them to make movies exclusively at the Warner Bros. studio.
The two sides in the legal battle have hurled accusations of duplicity at each other for weeks, and both Warner and Sony have accused each other of trying to sabotage each other's prospects for success in the entertainment business.
But it may amount to little more than posturing; the two have continued on-again, off-again settlement talks over the last few weeks, and people familiar with the talks say the matter could be resolved within a week.
Both Warner and Sony declined to comment on the terms of the settlement discussions.
But the people familiar with the talks said that Warner isn't expected to get any cash in the settlement.
Instead, Sony is likely to agree to let Warner participate in certain of its businesses, such as the record club of Sony's CBS Records unit.
Warner has surpassed Sony as the largest record company, but it doesn't have a powerful world-wide record club like CBS.
The two sides are also discussing certain business ventures involving cable rights to Columbia's movies.
In addition, Sony is expected to agree to swap Columbia's 35% stake in the sprawling Burbank, Calif., studio that Warner and Columbia share, in exchange for the old MGM studio lot that Warner acquired with the purchase of Lorimar Telepictures Corp.
Still, it may be tough for the two to have a smooth partnership in anything, in the wake of sworn affidavits filed over the last week.
One, for example, came from CBS Records Chairman Walter Yetnikoff, who will head a committee that will oversee Sony's entertainment division, including both records and movies.
In his affidavit, Mr. Yetnikoff accused Warner Chairman Steven J. Ross of having an "antiSony, anti-Japanese bias" and said that Mr. Ross had tried to talk him out of letting Sony buy CBS Records two years ago for that reason.
Mr. Ross, who will be chairman and co-chief executive officer of Time Warner after the merger is complete, denied that in his own affidavit, and called Mr. Yetnikoff's remarks "vicious" and his claims "reckless, irresponsible and baseless," saying Warner under his leadership has started a number of businesses in Japan.
Mr. Ross also said he enjoys "warm professional and personal relationships" with Japanese executives including Sony Chairman Akio Morita, "who has visited my home here."
But despite the acrimony between Mr. Ross and Mr. Yetnikoff, officials of the Time side of Time Warner have reportedly been increasingly interested in a settlement that might yield attractive business opportunities.
Time executives such as the company's president, N.J. Nicholas, who will eventually be co-chief executive of Time Warner alongside Mr. Ross, have no personal relationships or ego at stake in the fight over the Guber-Peters duo, and were never directly drawn into the fray.
Talks between the two sides could unravel, of course, as they have more than once since Sony announced its plans to hire Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters.
But both sides appear to be more willing now to meet each other's terms to resolve the issue.
And although Warner has said it wanted the producers to fulfill the terms of their contract, the producers said in sworn court declarations that they didn't believe the relationship could be repaired after the acrimony of the legal battle.
Any settlement is also expected to exclude Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters from any of the projects they were working on at Warner.
The Guber-Peters duo have 50 projects in various stages of development and production at Warner, including "Bonfire of the Vanities" and "A Bright Shining Lie."
But that doesn't mean Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters might not eventually get their hands on some of their projects; studios develop hundreds of movies but produce only 10 to 20 each year.
Once a studio chooses not to actually make a movie that is in development, producers are typically free to take it elsewhere.
Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters also almost certainly wouldn't be able to participate in future sequels to "Batman," the blockbuster hit they produced for Warner.
But in acquiring Guber-Peters Entertainment, Sony will actually get a piece of the profits from "Batman," since the publicly held concern gets certain revenue from the movies Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters produce.
The two producers own a combined 28% stake in Guber-Peters.
Southern Co.'s Gulf Power Co. subsidiary pleaded guilty to two felony charges of conspiracy to make illegal political contributions and tax evasion, and paid $500,000 in fines.
Gulf Power's guilty plea before U.S. District Judge Robert L. Vining yesterday marks the end of only one part of a wide-ranging inquiry of Southern Co.
The company is the subject of a federal grand jury investigation into whether its officials and its utility subsidiaries conspired to cover up their accounting for spare parts to evade federal income taxes.
"The terms announced today are strictly between the United States and Gulf Power," said U.S. Attorney Robert L. Barr.
"This is only a further step in a lengthy investigation."
The plea settlement does not allow Southern Co. to charge any of the $500,000 to its customers, or take action against employees who provided information during the federal inquiry.
Gulf Power had been under investigation for violating the Utility Holding Company Act, which prohibits public utilities from making political contributions.
In a statement, Southern Co. President Edward L. Addison said, "We believe our decision to plead (guilty) to these charges is responsible and proper.
And our action today will allow Gulf Power to avoid prolonged, distracting legal proceedings."
He did not say what effect, if any, the $500,000 fine would have on the company's earnings.
Mr. Barr said yesterday's plea by Gulf Power, which came after months of negotiations, was based on evidence that Gulf Power had set up an elaborate payment system through which it reimbursed outside vendors -- primarily three Florida advertising agencies -- for making illegal political contributions on its behalf.
The Appleyard Agency, for example, allegedly made contributions from 1982 to 1984 to various funds for political candidates, then submitted bills to Gulf Power.
The contributions were funded by monthly payments of $1,000 to $2,000 to Appleyard in the guise of a "special production fee" -- in effect, hiding the nature of the payments from the Internal Revenue Service, federal prosecutors said.
The government also indicated that former Gulf Power senior vice president Jacob F. "Jake" Horton was the mastermind behind the use of the ad agencies -- Appleyard, Dick Leonard Group II Inc. and Hemmer & Yates Corp. -- to make payments to various political candidates from 1981 to 1988.
Mr. Horton, who oversaw Gulf Power's governmental-affairs efforts, died mysteriously in a plane crash in April after learning he might be fired following the uncovering of irregularities in a company audit.
Government officials declined to say whether the investigation includes the ad agencies or the politicians involved.
In New York Stock Exchange trading, Southern Co. rose 50 cents a share to $27.125.
TO GRAB a bigger piece of the declining scotch market, Seagram Co. has launched a controversial "frequent drinker" promotion for its Chivas Regal brand.
Under the program, dubbed Chivas Class, customers who send in two labels from Chivas bottles will receive an upgrade in seating class on some Trans World Airlines flights.
Repeat customers also can purchase luxury items at reduced prices.
But at a time of mounting concern over alcohol abuse, some liquor marketers consider Seagram's frequent buyer promotion risky.
"I'm surprised they're doing this," says Penn Kavanagh, president of Schieffelin & Somerset Co., which markets Johnnie Walker scotches.
"I would be very leery of anything that says if you drink more, you get more."
Others question the impact on Chivas's upscale image of a promotion that has customers soaking off labels.
"It's really bizarre," says Albert Lerman, creative director at the Wells Rich Greene ad agency.
"Chivas has an image of something you would savor, rather than guzzle."
Chivas Class isn't the first such promotion.
Last year, J&B Scotch offered 500 TWA frequent flier miles in exchange for a label.
And Dewar's gave discounts on Scottish merchandise to people who sent in bottle labels.
But the scope of Seagram's Chivas promotion sets it apart.
The current campaign is just the first leg of an aggressive three-to-five-year direct marketing plan.
Seagram says the promotion is designed to build brand loyalty rather than promote heavy drinking.
Seagram asks customers to buy only two or three bottles over a 12-month period, says Richard Shaw, vice president of U.S. direct marketing.
"We're not asking them to save up 50 proof-of-purchases.
We're not saying drink more, we're saying trade up."
MOST FOOD companies these days are trimming the fat and cholesterol content of their products to appeal to health-conscious consumers.
But Goya Foods Inc. believes it can milk some sales by bucking the trend.
The Secaucus, N.J., company has formed a joint venture with a distributor called La Lecheria to market a higher-fat milk targeted at Hispanic consumers.
To give Leche Fresca the creamier taste Goya says Hispanics prefer, the new brand has a butterfat content of 3.8%.
That compares with 3.5% butterfat for whole milk.
A spokesman for Borden Inc., the nation's largest milk producer, concedes Goya may be on to something.
Borden sells considerably more whole milk than reduced-fat milks in southern and Hispanic markets, he says.
Borden even tested a milk with 4% butterfat in the South, but decided the market was too small.
Goya is selling Leche Fresca in nearly 500 grocery stores and bodegas in New York and parts of New Jersey.
And it's adding 15 to 20 new outlets a day, says Greg Ricca, sales director at La Lecheria.
Because of Leche Fresca's success, he says, the joint venture is developing other dairy products tailored to Hispanic tastes.
FOR YEARS, costume jewelry makers fought a losing battle.
Jewelry displays in department stores were often cluttered and uninspired.
And the merchandise was, well, fake.
As a result, marketers of faux gems steadily lost space in department stores to more fashionable rivals -- cosmetics makers.
But lately, retailers say, fake has become more fashionable.
And jewelry makers are beginning to use many of the same marketing tricks honed in the aggressive world of cosmetics.
Last year, the total women's fashion jewelry business topped $4.9 billion, says Karen Alberg, editor of Accessories magazine.
And it's growing fast, with annual sales gains of more than 10%.
To increase their share of that business, jewelry makers such as Crystal Brands Inc.'s Trifari and Monet units and Swank Inc., maker of Anne Klein jewelry, are launching new lines with as much fanfare as the fragrance companies.
They're hiring models to stroll the aisles sporting their jewels, and they're even beginning to borrow a perennial favorite of the beauty business -- offering a gift when consumers make a purchase.
"We've started trying just about anything to keep sales moving in the stores," says Kim Renk, a Swank vice president.
But there are limits.
Ms. Renk says retailers nixed a promotion for pins with animal motifs.
Her idea: bring in live zoo animals.
Trifari, whose national ads earlier this year included paper cutouts of its costume finery, takes a tamer approach.
The company focuses on the how-to aspects, says Andrew E. Philip, president.
Trifari now trains sales help to advise customers on the best earring styles.
But cosmetics firms still have one big marketing edge: They motivate sales people with commissions.
Jewelry makers rarely pay commissions and aren't expected to anytime soon.
DESPITE GROWING interest in the environment, U.S. consumers haven't shown much interest in refillable packages for household products.
Procter & Gamble Co. recently introduced refillable versions of four products, including Tide and Mr. Clean, in Canada, but doesn't plan to bring them to the U.S..

Northwest Airlines settled the remaining lawsuits filed on behalf of 156 people killed in a 1987 crash, but claims against the jetliner's maker are being pursued, a federal judge said.
Northwest, a unit of NWA Inc., and McDonnell Douglas Corp., which made the MD-80 aircraft, also are pursuing counterclaims against each other in the crash near Detroit Metropolitan Airport.
Terms of the settlements for the remaining 145 lawsuits against Northwest weren't disclosed.
A total of 157 lawsuits were filed on behalf of crash victims.
U.S. District Judge Julian A. Cook Jr. announced the settlements as the jury trial was to begin yesterday.
He reset opening arguments for today.
The jury will resolve the claims against McDonnell Douglas, Northwest's claim that a defect in the aircraft caused the crash, and McDonnell Douglas' claim that the plane was improperly flown.
The National Transportation Safety Board ruled that pilots failed to set the plane's wing flaps and slats properly for takeoff and failed to make mandatory preflight checks that would have detected the error.
Also, a cockpit warning system failed to alert the pilots the flaps and slats were not set for takeoff, the NTSB said.
The only passenger who survived the crash was Cecelia Cichan, then 4, of Tempe, Ariz., whose parents and brother died in the crash.
She now lives with relatives in Alabama.
Sun Myung Moon, the Korean evangelist-industrialist who in 1954 founded the Unification Church, remains the mystery man behind a multimillion-dollar political and publishing operation based in this country and catering to the American right.
But there may be less there than meets the eye.
Mr. Moon planned to convert millions of Americans to his unique brand of Christianity -- in which he plays the role of Old Testament-style temporal, political messiah -- and then to make the U.S. part of a unified international theocracy.
His original strategy (in itself a brilliant innovation for spreading a religion) was to create new economic enterprises each time he wanted to extend and fund his various religious missions.
Tax-exempt airport and street-corner solicitations were intended only to provide start-up funds.
More stable industries were to build an economically viable infrastructure for the Moon movement in North America, as they had in Japan and South Korea.
Then he would move his movement to Europe.
But that was not to be.
Throughout the 1970s and early 1980s spokesmen for both the Unification Church and its opponents in the anticult movement gave wildly exaggerated membership figures.
Their legacy lives on.
It is still common to read in the press that the church has 10,000 or more full-time American members and 25,000 "associates."
Some estimates have gone as high as 80,000 members.
But internal church documents clearly show that at its publicity-seeking heights, as when it organized a spectacular Yankee Stadium bicentennial rally in 1976, there actually were only about 2,000 full-time Unification Church members in the U.S.
Mr. Moon's support for a Watergate-beleaguered Richard Nixon, the Koreagate scandal, and his prison sentence for income-tax evasion did not help the church's recruitment efforts.
Defections, burnouts, and abduction "deprogrammings" kept member turnover high.
That the membership number has even kept close to its 1976 size is the result of the "graying" of the church.
Many of the enthusiastic young "Moonies" of the Nixon era who remained faithful to Father Moon are now parents, producing new members by procreation rather than conversion.
The reputed wealth of the Unification Church is another matter of contention.
For a while in the 1970s it seemed Mr. Moon was on a spending spree, with such purchases as the former New Yorker Hotel and its adjacent Manhattan Center; a fishing/processing conglomerate with branches in Alaska, Massachusetts, Virginia and Louisiana; a former Christian Brothers monastery and the Seagram family mansion (both picturesquely situated on the Hudson River); shares in banks from Washington to Uruguay; a motion picture production company, and newspapers, such as the Washington Times, the New York City Tribune (originally the News World), and the successful Spanish-language Noticias del Mundo.
Yet these purchases can be misleading.
Most were obtained with huge inputs of church money from South Korea and Japan, minimum cash downpayments and sizable mortgages.
Those teams of young fund-raisers selling flowers, peanuts or begging outright at traffic intersections brought in somewhere near $20 million a year during the mid-to-late 1970s, but those revenues were a pittance compared to the costs of Mr. Moon's lavish international conferences, speaking tours, and assorted land buys.
Only his factories in Japan and Korea, employing his followers at subsistence wages and producing everything from rifles to ginseng to expensive marble vases, kept the money flowing westward.
Virginia Commonwealth University sociologist David Bromley, who more than any other researcher has delved into the complex world of Unificationist finances, has concluded that profitable operations in the U.S. have been the exceptions rather than the rule.
Likewise, journalists John Burgess and Michael Isikoff of the Washington Post have estimated that at least $800 million was transferred from Japan to the U.S. to deal with the church's annual operating losses in this country.
Mr. Moon's two English-language U.S. newspapers illustrate the scope of this financial drain.
Start-up costs for the Washington Times alone were close to $50 million, and the total amount lost in this journalistic black hole was estimated at $150 million by 1984.
Since then, Moon's organization has inaugurated a pair of high-quality glossy opinion magazines, The World and I and Insight, which are a further drain.
Insiders say that not even their editors know for sure how much these show-piece publications, along with the newspapers, have cost Mr. Moon.
Many American church-owned businesses, such as a $30 million factory to build fishing vessels, are defunct.
Some components of the American church had their budgets cut in half last year and again this year.
The relatively small academic conferences that have attracted conservative guests -- and press scrutiny -- in recent years are much more narrowly targeted and austere than the thousand-person get-togethers in fancy digs and exotic locales of years past.
I attended several of these in the dual role as a presenter of research findings as well as an investigator of my hosts.
According to veteran watchers of Unificationist affairs, such as Dr. J. Gordon Melton, director of the Institute for the Study of American Religion, almost all operations are being drastically reduced as Mr. Moon now concentrates more on developing his empire in the Far East.
"Everything," one non-`` Moonie" senior consultant to the Unification Church recently told me in an interview, "is going back to Korea and Japan."
(Europe had proved even less hospitable than North America.
So Mr. Moon is in retreat, refocusing on the Far East.
South Korea and Japan continue to be profitable.
Moon's Tong'Il industry conglomerate is now investing heavily in China, where church accountants have high hopes of expanding and attracting converts even in the wake of the bloody massacre in Tiananmen Square.
Panda Motors is one such investment.
According to senior consultants to the church, Mr. Moon has successfully negotiated a joint venture with the Chinese government to build an automobile-parts plant in Guangdong Province, an area of China with a substantial Korean minority.
Mr. Moon has agreed to put up $10 million a year for 25 years and keep the profits in China.
In return, he has the government's blessing to build churches and spread Unificationism in that country.
Whatever respectability and ties to intellectuals and opinion-makers the publications and conferences bring really are salvage -- not the Rev. Moon's original final goals, but the ones for which he will have to settle.
Mr. Shupe is co-author (with David G. Bromley) of "`Moonies' in America: Cult, Church, and Crusade" and "Strange Gods: The Great American Cult Scare.
The Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust said it is considering several ways to ease a liquidity crunch that could include the sale of Manville Corp. to a third party.
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the majority holder of Manville acknowledged that the cash portion of its initial funding of $765 million will be depleted next year, and that alternative sources of funds will be necessary to meet its obligations.
The trust, which was created as part of Manville's bankruptcy-law reorganization to compensate victims of asbestos-related diseases, ultimately expects to receive $2.5 billion from Manville, but its cash flow from investments has so far lagged behind its payments to victims.
Spokespersons for both the trust and the company refused to comment on whether any talks with a possible acquirer of Manville had actually taken place.
The trust is considering a sale of its Manville holdings, but Manville has the right of first refusal on any sales of its stock held by the trust.
Manville, a forest and building products concern, has offered to pay the trust $500 million for a majority of Manville's convertible preferred stock.
Manville and the trust are discussing the offer, but no decision has been made.
The filing also said the trust is considering a sale of Manville securities in the open market; an extraordinary dividend on the common stock; or a recapitalization of Manville.
The Soviet Union's jobless rate is soaring to 27% in some areas, Pravda said.
It said the situation is caused by efforts to streamline bloated factory payrolls.
Unemployment has reached 27.6% in Azerbaijan, 25.7% in Tadzhikistan, 22.8% in Uzbekistan, 18.8% in Turkmenia, 18% in Armenia and 16.3% in Kirgizia, the Communist Party newspaper said.
All are non-Russian republics along the southern border of the Soviet Union, and all but Kirgizia have reported rioting in the past six months.
The newspaper said it is past time for the Soviet Union to create unemployment insurance and retraining programs like those of the West.
Pravda gave no estimate for overall unemployment but said an "Association of the Unemployed" has cropped up that says the number of jobless is 23 million Soviets, or 17% of the work force.
An 11-week dispute involving Australia's 1,640 domestic pilots has slashed airline earnings and crippled much of the continent's tourist industry.
"The only people who are flying are those who have to," said Frank Moore, chairman of the Australian Tourist Industry Association.
He added: "How is a travel agent going to sell a holiday when he cannot guarantee a return flight?"
Transport giant TNT, which owns half of one of the country's two major domestic carriers, said the cost of the dispute had been heavy, cutting TNT's profits 70% to $12 million in the three months to Sept. 30.
Brazilian financier Naji Nahas, who was arrested on Monday after 102 days in hiding, is likely to be interrogated next week by the Brazilian judiciary.
Mr. Nahas, who single-handedly provoked a one-day closure of Brazil's stock markets in June when he failed to honor a debt of $31.1 million owed to his brokers, yesterday blamed his predicament on the president of the Sao Paulo stock exchange; a few days before Mr. Nahas's failure, the exchange raised the required margin on stock-margin transactions.
China's parliament ousted two Hong Kong residents from a panel drafting a new constitution for the colony.
The two, Szeto Wah and Martin Lee, were deemed unfit because they had condemned China's crackdown on its pro-democracy movement.
The committee is formulating Hong Kong's constitution for when it reverts to Chinese control in 1997, and Chinese lawmakers said the two can only return if they "abandon their antagonistic stand against the Chinese government and their attempt to nullify the Sino-British joint declaration on Hong Kong."
NUCLEAR REACTOR FOR ISRAEL?
Israeli officials confirmed that Energy Minister Moshe Shahal and his Canadian counterpart, Jake Epp, discussed a possible Israeli purchase of a $1.1 billion Canadian nuclear reactor for producing electricity.
However, a Canadian Embassy official in Tel Aviv said that Canada was unlikely to sell the Candu heavy-water reactor to Israel since Israel hasn't signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
Israel has been accused in the past of using subterfuge to seek elements needed to develop nuclear weapons.
The South Korean government is signing a protocol today establishing formal diplomatic relations with Poland.
The two are also signing a trade agreement.
South Korean government officials said they don't expect that Seoul can loan money to Warsaw, but it can "offer experience."
Poland is the second Communist nation to recognize the Seoul government; South Korea established diplomatic relations with Hungary in February 1989.
Venezuela will hold a debt-equity auction Friday, with 32 potential bidders participating.
Earlier this year, Venezuela announced it was opening up debt-equity swaps to foreign investors but said the program would be limited to a net disbursement of $600 million a year.
Friday's auction will be limited to $150 million disbursed by the Central Bank to potential investors.
The office of foreign investment has authorized some $1.78 billion worth of investment proposals, said Edwin Perozo, superintendent of foreign investment.
Most of the proposals are in tourism, basic industry and fishery and agro-industry projects, he said.
Under the debt-equity program, potential investors will submit sealed bids on the percentage of discount they are willing to purchase the debt at, and the bids will be allocated based on these discount offers.
The Venezuelan central bank set a 30% floor on the bidding.

A federal judge ruled that Imelda Marcos wasn't brought to the U.S. against her will and that marital privileges, which protect spouses from incriminating each other, don't apply in her case.
As a result, Judge John F. Keenan of New York ordered Mrs. Marcos to turn over to the court all pleadings and documents she may have filed in foreign countries in opposition to U.S. requests for evidence.
Mrs. Marcos had claimed that she didn't have to turn over the documents because she was brought here involuntarily and because providing the materials would violate her marital privilege.
In 1988, a year and a half after Mrs. Marcos and her late husband, Ferdinand Marcos, the ousted president of the Philippines, fled the Philippines for Hawaii, they were charged with racketeering, conspiracy, obstruction of justice and mail fraud in a scheme in which they allegedly embezzled more than $100 million from their homeland.
Much of the money was fraudulently concealed through purchases of prime Manhattan real estate, federal prosecutors have charged.
Mrs. Marcos's trial is expected to begin in March.
U.S. law requires criminal defendants to turn over foreign documents such as those sought in the Marcos case.
The law is meant to overcome delays caused by defendants' use of foreign procedures to block U.S. requests for records, Judge Keenan said in his opinion.
For instance, the documents could involve foreign business dealings or bank accounts.
The U.S. has charged that the Marcoses' alleged crimes involved bank accounts in the Philippines, Hong Kong, the U.S. and other countries.
On the allegation of kidnapping, Judge Keenan wrote, "The suggestion that Mrs. Marcos was brought to this country against her will is unsupported by affidavit or affirmation."
The judge also said the two marital testimonial privileges cited by Mrs. Marcos don't apply.
The first one permits a witness to refuse to testify against her spouse.
But Judge Keenan said that privilege's purpose is "fostering harmony in marriage."
Because Mr. Marcos died Sept. 28, the privilege can no longer apply, the judge said.
The second marital privilege cited by Mrs. Marcos protects confidential communications between spouses.
But Judge Keenan said that privilege is meant to protect private utterances -- not litigation papers filed with foreign governments, as Mrs. Marcos's attorneys maintained.
Though Judge Keenan threw out most of Mrs. Marcos's objections, he agreed with one of her concerns: that turning over the foreign documents could violate the defendant's constitutional right against self-incrimination.
As a result, he said he will examine the Marcos documents sought by the prosecutors to determine whether turning over the filings is self-incrimination.
Judge Keenan also directed the prosecutors to show that Mrs. Marcos's Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination won't be violated.
Mrs. Marcos's attorney in New York, Sandor Frankel, declined to comment on the ruling.
Mrs. Marcos hasn't admitted that she filed any documents such as those sought by the government.
Charles LaBella, the assistant U.S. attorney prosecuting the Marcos case, didn't return phone calls seeking comment.
U.S.. AND BRITISH LAW FIRMS announce rare joint venture in Tokyo.
Sidley & Austin, a leading Chicago-based law firm, and Ashurst Morris Crisp, a midsized London firm of solicitors, are scheduled today to announce plans to open a joint office in Tokyo.
The firms will be registered under Japanese law as foreign legal consultants and their practice with Japanese clients will be limited to advising them on matters of foreign law.
The office may also be able to advise foreign and multinational clients on international law and general matters.
The office will provide "one-stop shopping" for Japanese financial institutions and other clients seeking advice on access to the world capital markets, according to A. Bruce Schimberg, Sidley's senior banking specialist, who will move to Tokyo from Chicago to open the office next year.
The Sidley-Ashurst venture will also be staffed by another Sidley partner specializing in corporate law, a partner from Ashurst concentrating on acquisitions and a Japanese attorney.
The office will tap the resources of Sidley's 700 lawyers in the U.S., London and Singapore as well as the 400 Ashurst staff members in London and Brussels.
Ashurst is new to the Far East.
Sidley will maintain its association with the Hashidate Law Office in Tokyo.
THE UNITED AUTO WORKERS said it will seek a rehearing of a U.S. appellate court ruling against the union's claim that the state of Michigan engages in wage-discrimination against female employees.
A three-judge panel of the court in Cincinnati made the ruling Saturday.
The UAW is seeking a hearing by the full 14-judge panel.
The union sued the state in November 1985, alleging that it intentionally segregated job classifications by sex and paid employees in predominantly female jobs less than males in comparable jobs.
The UAW also charged that the state applied its own standards for determining pay in a discriminatory manner.
In November 1987, a district court judge in Detroit ruled against the UAW.
The union is the bargaining representative for more than 20,000 Michigan state employees.
One of the largest law firms in central New Jersey has been created through the merger of Norris, McLaughlin & Marcus, a 41-lawyer firm, and Manger, Kalison, McBride & Webb, a health-care specialty law firm with 14 lawyers.
Norris McLaughlin is a general-practice firm that has expanded recently into such specialties as banking, labor and environmental work.
The merged firm will carry Norris McLaughlin's name.
A Texas legislator proposes color-coding drivers' licenses of some drug offenders.
The bill would authorize courts to order the licenses as a condition of probation.
State Senator J.E. "Buster" Brown, a Republican who is running for Texas attorney general, introduced the bill.
He said an altered license would be an "embarrassment" to teenagers and young adults and would act as a deterrant to drug use.
Richard Avena, executive director of the Texas Civil Liberties Union, called the proposal "political gimmickry," and said it fails to recognize the drug problem as a health issue.
The amendment, offered by Rep. Douglas Bosco (D., Calif.), was approved 283-132 during debate on a bill designed to strengthen the Transportation Department's authority in dealing with leveraged buy-outs of airlines.
The bill would require the agency to block the acquisition of 15% or more of an airline's stock if the purchase threatened safety, reduced the carrier's ability to compete, or put the airline under foreign control.
Debate on the legislation, which faces a veto threat from President Bush, is to continue today.
The amendment would require the department to block the purchase of a major airline by anyone who has run two or more carriers that have filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.
In 1983, Texas Air's Continental Airlines filed for bankruptcy.
Earlier this year, Texas Air's Eastern Airlines filed for bankruptcy.
"This ought to be subtitled the `Don't let Frank Lorenzo take over another airline' amendment," said Rep. James Oberstar (D., Minn.), chairman of the House aviation subcommittee, who argued that the provision was unnecessary because the bill already would give the department ample power to block undesirable deals.
For years, a strict regimen governed the staff meetings at Nissan Motor Co.'s technical center in Tokyo's western suburbs.
Employees wore identification badges listing not only their names but also their dates of hire.
No one could voice an opinion until everybody with more seniority had spoken first, so younger employees -- often the most enthusiastic and innovative -- seldom spoke up at all.
But in 1986, the badges and the "don't speak out of turn" rule were abolished -- early steps in a cultural revolution still rolling on with all the subtlety of a freight train.
In recent years, Nissan has instituted flex-time work schedules and allowed employees to dress casually, even in blue jeans.
A rule forbidding staffers to own competitors' cars has been lifted, and now many designers drive foreign cars to get useful ideas.
Nissan's decades-old corporate song filled with references to Mount Fuji has been scrapped in favor of a snappy tune sung by a popular Japanese vocalist.
And in a Japanese corporate first, Nissan recently opened the first coed company dormitory for single employees at the suburban Tokyo technical center.
"We had lots of internal debate about this one," concedes Tadahiko Fukuyama, a senior public-relations official.
"But in the end, top management decided to follow the voice of the younger generation."
This corporate glasnost is a big reason Nissan, after years of making lackluster cars and lousy profits, has loosened up its rigid ways and now is riding a string of hits, ranging from the sleek Maxima sedan and Porsche-like 300ZX to the whimsically nostalgic Pao, a minicar sold only in Japan.
The company's turnaround is far from complete; many crucial tests are just beginning.
But its surprising progress so far holds important lessons for companies in trouble.
The big one: A company's culture can't be radically changed unless top management first admits that things have gone badly awry and then publicly leads the charge.
Atsushi Muramatsu, Nissan's executive vice president for finance, helped set the tone in December 1986, when the company was heading toward the first operating loss by a Japanese auto maker since the nation's postwar recovery.
"This is a time of self-criticism to discover what is wrong with us," he said.
Yutaka Kume, who took the helm as Nissan's president in June 1985, added simply, "I am deeply disappointed."
No wonder.
Nissan, Japan's second-largest auto maker and the world's fourth-largest, was getting beat up not only by its bigger rival, Toyota Motor Corp., but also by Honda Motor Co., the most successful Japanese car company in the U.S. but a relative pipsqueak in Japan.
Nissan's market share in Japan had been dropping year by year since the beginning of the decade.
Its U.S. sales sagged, partly because of price increases due to the rising yen.
Worst of all, Nissan was preoccupied with management infighting, cronyism and corporate rigidity.
Consider the experience of Satoko Kitada, a 30-year-old designer of vehicle interiors who joined Nissan in 1982.
At that time, tasks were assigned strictly on the basis of seniority.
"The oldest designer got to work on the dashboard," she recalls.
"The next level down did doors.
If a new person got to work on part of the speedometer, that was a big deal."
This system produced boring, boxy cars that consumers just weren't buying.
Desperately hoping to spark sales, Nissan transferred 5,000 middle managers and plant workers to dealerships.
Meanwhile, President Kume ordered everyone from top executives to rookie designers to go "town watching," to visit chic parts of Tokyo to try to gain insights into developing cars for trend-setters.
Some town-watching excursions were downright comic.
One group of middle-aged manufacturing men from the company's Zama plant outside Tokyo was supposed to check out a trendy restaurant in the city.
But when they arrived at the door, all were afraid to go in, fearing that they would be out of place.
Other trips were more productive.
Mr. Kume himself visited Honda's headquarters in Tokyo's upscale Aoyama district.
He liked the well-lighted lobby display of Honda's cars and trucks so much that he had Nissan's gloomy lobby exhibit refurbished.
Later, Nissan borrowed other Honda practices, including an engineering "idea contest" to promote inventiveness.
One engineer developed a "crab car" that moves sideways.
Such sudden cultural shifts may come across as a bit forced, but they seem to be genuine -- so much so, in fact, that some older employees have resisted.
Nissan handled the die-hards in a typically Japanese fashion: They weren't fired but instead "were neglected," says Kouji Hori, the personnel manager at the Nissan Technical Center.
Despite the pain of adjusting, the cultural revolution has begun to yield exciting cars.
A year ago, the company completely revamped its near-luxury sedan, the $17,699 Maxima, which competes against a broad range of upscale sedans; it replaced its boxy, pug-nosed body with sleek, aerodynamic lines.
Since then, Nissan also has launched new versions of the $13,249 240SX sporty coupe and 300ZX sports car.
The restyled 300ZX costs as much as $33,000 and is squared off against the Porche 944, which begins at $41,900.
Besides new styling, the new Nissans have more powerful engines and more sophisticated suspension systems.
All three new models are outselling their predecessors by wide margins.
In its home market, Nissan has grabbed attention with limited-production minicars featuring styling odd enough to be cute.
One is the Pao, a tiny coupe with a peelback canvas top and tilted headlights that give it a droopy-eyed look.
Nissan initially planned to sell just 10,000 Paos, but sales have passed 50,000, and there's a one-year waiting list for the car.
Then, there's the S-Cargo, an offbeat delivery van with a snail-like body that inspired its name.
Nissan helped develop a Tokyo restaurant with both vehicles as its design theme.
The chairs are S-Cargo seats, and a gift shop sells such items as alarm clocks styled like the Pao's oversized speedometer.
All these vehicles have sharply improved Nissan's morale and image -- but haven't done much for its market share.
Nissan had 29% of the Japanese car market in 1980 before beginning a depressing eight-year slide that continued through last year.
Strong sales so far this year are certain to turn the tide, but even the 25% market share that Nissan expects in 1989 will leave it far below its position at the beginning of the decade.
Nissan concedes that it won't recoup all its market-share losses in Japan until at least 1995, and even that timetable might prove optimistic.
"Everyone else is going to catch up" with Nissan's innovative designs, says A. Rama Krishna, auto analyst at First Boston (Japan) Ltd.
Nissan's pace of new-model hits will slow, he adds, just as arch-rival Toyota unleashes its own batch of new cars.
Likewise, in the U.S., Nissan has grabbed 5.2% of the car market so far this year, up from 4.5% a year ago.
But even that brings Nissan only to the share it had in 1987, and leaves the company behind its high of 5.5% in 1980 and 1982.
Why?
So far, Nissan's new-model successes are mostly specialized vehicles with limited sales potential.
In compact and subcompact cars, the bread-and-butter sales generators for Japanese auto makers, Nissan still trails Toyota and Honda.
Nissan hopes that that will start to change this fall, with its new version of the Stanza compact sedan.
The Stanza has been a nonentity compared with Honda's hugely successful Accord and Toyota's Camry.
But this year, Honda has revamped the Accord and made it a midsized car.
Nissan instead has kept its new Stanza a bit smaller than that and cut the base price 6%; at $11,450, Stanza prices start $749 below the predecessor model yet have a more-powerful engine.
Accord prices start at $12,345.
Nissan's risk is that its low-base-price strategy might get lost amid the highly publicized rebates being offered by Detroit's Big Three.
But "on a new car, a rebate doesn't work well" because it cheapens the vehicle's image, contends Thomas D. Mignanelli, executive vice president of Nissan's U.S. sales arm.
Even if the new Stanza succeeds, Nissan will remain behind in the subcompact segment, where its Sentra doesn't measure up to the Honda Civic and Toyota Corolla.
Nissan will introduce a completely revamped Sentra next fall.
At the opposite end of the market, Nissan launches its luxury Infiniti division on Nov. 8 -- three years after Honda pioneered Japanese luxury cars and two months after Toyota's Lexus went on sale.
Nissan started advertising Infiniti fully eight months before the cars hit American showrooms.
The ads featured fences, rocks and pussy-willow buds -- almost anything but the cars themselves.
The ads have generated some laughs but also plenty of attention because they are so unlike any other U.S. auto advertising.
On the other hand, Nissan's sales goals for Infiniti are modest compared with Toyota's targets for Lexus.
Nissan will build only about 3,500 of the $38,000 Infiniti Q45 sedans each month, sending about 2,000 of them to the U.S. and keeping the rest for sale in Japan.
Toyota wants to sell about 49,000 Lexus LS400 sedans next year in the U.S. alone.
"When I saw the Lexus sales projections, I got worried," confesses Takashi Oka, who led the Infiniti development team.
But on reflection, Mr. Oka says, he concluded that Nissan is being prudent in following its slow-startup strategy instead of simply copying Lexus.
"Infiniti is Nissan's big business move for the 21st century, and we're in no hurry to generate large profits right away," Mr. Oka says.
Despite plans to add two new Infiniti models next year, bringing the total to four, Infiniti won't show profits for at least five years, he adds.
These days Nissan can afford that strategy, even though profits aren't exactly robust.
Nissan had record net income of 114.63 billion yen ($868 million) in the fiscal year ended last March 31, a remarkable recovery from the 20.39 billion yen of two years earlier, when the company lost money on operations.
Nissan has increased earnings more than market share by cutting costs and by taking advantage of a general surge in Japanese car sales.
But Nissan expects to earn only 120 billion yen in the current fiscal year, a modest increase of 4.7%.
The big reason: For all its cost-cutting, Nissan remains less efficient than Toyota.
In its last fiscal year, Nissan's profit represented just 2.3% of sales, compared with 4.3% at Toyota.
To help close the gap, Nissan recently established a top-level cost-cutting committee.
Nissan is the world's only auto maker currently building vehicles in all three of the world's key economic arenas -- the U.S., Japan and Europe.
That gives it an enviable strategic advantage, at least until its rivals catch up, but also plenty of managerial headaches.
For example, Nissan's U.S. operations include 10 separate subsidiaries -- for manufacturing, sales, design, research, etc. -- that report separately back to Japan.
And in July, Nissan's Tennessee manufacturing plant beat back a United Auto Workers organizing effort with aggressive tactics that have left some workers bitter.
"We are in a transitional phase from being a Japanese company to becoming an international company based in Japan," says Mr. Muramatsu, the executive vice president.
He promises that Nissan will soon establish a holding company overseeing all U.S. operations, just as it's doing in Europe.
Perhaps the biggest challenge, however, will be to prevent a return to its former corporate rigidity as its recovery continues.
Already, personnel officials are talking about the need for a "Phase Two" cultural-reform effort of some sort.
"We are still only half way through the turnaround of this company, and there are many more things to do," President Kume says.
He adds, however, that "the momentum we have generated is unstoppable.
As expected, Warner Bros. Records said it agreed to form a recorded-music and music-publishing joint venture with former MCA Records Chairman Irving Azoff.
Warner said it will provide financing for the venture, but didn't disclose terms.
Mr. Azoff hasn't named the company yet, but any records it produces will be distributed by Warner.
Warner is part of Warner Communications Inc., which is in the process of being acquired by Time Warner Inc.
Mr. Azoff resigned as head of MCA Records, a unit of MCA Inc., in September, and had been discussing a joint venture with both Warner and MCA.
In a statement yesterday, Mr. Azoff said he chose Warner, the largest record company, because "their standing in the entertainment industry is second to none.
President Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev will hold an informal meeting in early December, a move that should give both leaders a political boost at home.
The White House is purposely not calling the meeting a summit so that there won't be any expectation of detailed negotiations or agreements.
Rather, senior administration officials said that the unexpected meeting was scheduled at Mr. Bush's request because of his preference for conducting diplomacy through highly personal and informal meetings with other leaders.
The two leaders will meet on Dec. 2 and 3, alternating the two days of meetings between a U.S. and a Soviet naval vessel in the Mediterranean Sea.
The unusual seaborne meeting won't disrupt plans for a formal summit meeting next spring or summer, at which an arms-control treaty is likely to be completed.
In announcing the meeting yesterday, Mr. Bush told reporters at the White House that neither he nor Mr. Gorbachev expects any "substantial decisions or agreements."
Instead, he said that the purpose is simply for the two to get "better acquainted" and discuss a wide range of issues without a formal agenda.
Despite the informal nature of the session and the calculated effort to hold down expectations, the meeting could pay significant political dividends for both leaders.
Mr. Gorbachev badly needs a diversion from the serious economic problems and ethnic unrest he faces at home.
American officials have said that a meeting with the leader of the U.S. could help bolster his stature among Soviet politicians and academics, whose support he needs.
For his part, Mr. Bush has been criticized regularly at home for moving too slowly and cautiously in reacting to Mr. Gorbachev's reforms and the historic moves away from communism in Eastern Europe.
A face-to-face meeting with Mr. Gorbachev should damp such criticism, though it will hardly eliminate it.
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine), who has been the most prominent Democratic critic of Mr. Bush's handling of the Soviet relationship, praised the president for arranging the meeting.
But he added: "The mere fact of a meeting doesn't deal with the substance of policy."
Mr. Bush said that the December meeting, which was announced simultaneously in Moscow, will be held in the unusual setting of ships at sea to hold down the "fanfare" and force the two sides to limit participation to just small groups of advisers.
"By doing it in this manner we can have, I would say, more time without the press of social activities or mandatory joint appearances, things of that nature for public consumption," Mr. Bush said.
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, at a news conference in Moscow, said, "As the two sides plan to hold a full-scale summit in late spring-early summer next year, they found it useful, I would say even necessary, to hold an interim informal meeting."
Although no specific agreements are expected, Mr. Shevardnadze said "that doesn't mean they will be without an agenda."
If the two leaders cover the subjects that have been featured in lower level U.S.-Soviet meetings, their talks would include human rights, Soviet reforms, regional disputes, relations with allies, economic cooperation, arms control, and joint efforts to fight narcotics, terrorism and pollution.
The president specifically mentioned U.S. economic advice to Moscow as a possible topic.
Mr. Gorbachev has for months been publicly urging the U.S. to drop its restrictions on Soviet trade.
He recently told a small group of American businessmen in Moscow that he hoped to sign a general trade agreement with the U.S., possibly at the 1990 summit.
The Soviets hope a trade agreement would give them Most-Favored Nation status, which would lower the tariffs on Soviet exports to the U.S..
In an unusually candid article about the latest economic woe -- unemployment -- Pravda yesterday reported that three million Soviets have lost their jobs as a result of perestroika and the number could grow to 16 million by the year 2005.
Economists in Moscow are now proposing that the state start a system of unemployment benefits.
But one Bush administration official knowledgeable about the summit plan cautioned against assuming that there will be bold new initiatives on the Soviet economy or other issues.
"Don't take this as some big opening for major movement on economic cooperation, or arms control, or the environment," he said.
"Those things will all come up, but in a fairly informal way."
Instead, this official said, "This is vintage George Bush.
This was George Bush's own idea.
It's George Bush wanting to meet a foreign leader and talk to him directly."
Aside from the Soviet economic plight and talks on cutting strategic and chemical arms, one other issue the Soviets are likely to want to raise is naval force reductions.
Western analysts say that, given the meeting's setting at sea, Gorbachev is unlikely to pass up the opportunity to press once again for negotiated cuts in the navies of both the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact.
That theme has been a recurring one for Soviet military officials for much of this year.
They argue that as the Kremlin follows through on announced plans to cut land forces -- the Soviets' area of greatest strength -- the U.S. should show more willingness to cut sea forces -- Washington's area of greatest superiority.
One of the reasons Bush administration aides are anxious to insist that the coming meeting will be informal is to avoid comparisons with the last such loosely structured superpower gathering, former President Reagan's 1986 meeting with Mr. Gorbachev in Reykjavik, Iceland.
That meeting sent shivers through the Western alliance because Mr. Reagan was pulled into discussing the possible elimination of nuclear weapons without consulting American allies.
Mr. Bush said that he initiated talks with the Soviets on the informal meeting by sending a proposal to Mr. Gorbachev last July, which the Soviet leader readily accepted.
But word of the possible session was closely held by the president and a handful of top aides, and word of it didn't reach many second-level officials until the past few days.
Indeed, many senior officials had been insisting for weeks that Mr. Bush wasn't interested in such an informal get-together.
Though President Bush's political critics at home have been urging him to open a more direct dialogue with Mr. Gorbachev, it actually was the arguments of leaders within the Soviet bloc itself that led the president to seek the December meeting.
Mr. Bush decided he wanted the meeting after talking in Europe in July with the leaders of Poland and Hungary, who urged him to support Mr. Gorbachev's efforts to transform the Soviet system and to urge him to loosen his grip on Eastern Europe, a senior aide said.
While flying home from those discussions, Mr. Bush drafted a letter to Mr. Gorbachev suggesting an informal get-together to precede their formal summit next year.

Banca Nazionale del Lavoro said its potential losses from lending to Iraq could reach 1.175 trillion lire ($872 million), marking the bank's first quantification of potential costs of unauthorized lending by its Atlanta branch.
BNL previously reported that its Georgia branch had taken on loan commitments topping $3 billion without the Rome-based management's approval.
State-owned BNL, Italy's largest bank, has filed charges against the branch's former manager, Christopher Drogoul, and a former branch vice president, alleging fraud and breach of their fiduciary duties.
BNL also said that its board had approved "after an in-depth discussion," a letter to the Bank of Italy outlining measures the state-owned bank has taken or plans to take to improve controls on its foreign branches.
The central bank had ordered BNL to come up with a suitable program by yesterday.
Bank of Italy has also ordered BNL to shore up its capital base to account for potential foreign loan losses, and the Rome bank has outlined a 3 trillion lire capital-raising operation.
BNL was unable to elaborate on what measures were planned by the bank to improve controls on its branches abroad.
Hardly a day passes without news photos of the police dragging limp protesters from some building or thoroughfare in one of our cities.
Of recent note are the activities of the pro- and anti-abortionists, anti-nuclear activists, animal rights protesters, college students concerned about racism, anti-apartheid groups, various self-styled "environmentalists" and those dissatisfied with the pace of the war against AIDS.
Maybe he didn't start it, but Mohandas Gandhi certainly provided a recognizable beginning to non-violent civil disobedience as we know it today.
The Mahatma, or "great souled one," instigated several campaigns of passive resistance against the British government in India.
Unfortunately, according to Webster's Biographical Dictionary, "His policies went beyond his control and resulted... in riots and disturbances" and later a renewed campaign of civil disobedience "resulted in rioting and a second imprisonment."
I am not a proponent of everything Gandhi did, but some of his law breaking was justified because India was then under occupation by a foreign power, and Indians were not able to participate fully in decisions that vitally affected them.
It is difficult, however, to justify civil disobedience, non-violent or not, where citizens have full recourse to the ballot box to effect change.
Where truly representative governments are safeguarded by constitutional protections of human rights and an independent judiciary to construe those rights, there is no excuse for breaking the law because some individual or group disagrees with it.
There may be a few cases where the law breaking is well pinpointed and so completely non-invasive of the rights of others that it is difficult to criticize it.
The case of Rosa Parks, the black woman who refused to sit at the back of the bus, comes to mind as an illustration.
But most cases of non-violent civil disobedience are not nearly so benign.
The public has a tendency to equate lawful demonstrations with non-violent civil disobedience.
It is true that both are non-violent, but there is a fundamental difference between them.
Lawful demonstrations, such as peaceful picketing and other assemblages that do not disturb the peace or cause a public nuisance or interfere with the rights of others, are rights guaranteed by any truly free system of government.
Civil disobedience, violent or non-violent, is intentional law breaking.
The subject of this discussion is non-violent civil disobedience; but, before we get on with that, let me make just a few tangential remarks about lawful demonstrations.
They are useful to call public attention to grievances, but they have little value in educating anyone about the issues in dispute.
The delight of television in dramatic confrontation encourages overuse of slogans chanted through bullhorns, militant gestures, accusatory signs and other emotionally inspired tactics.
Civilized discourse and an environment where compromise can begin are lost in a hostile posture abetted by superficial media interviews.
At best, demonstrations are overused and boringly uninformative; at worst, they can become the stimuli that lead to law breaking.
Demonstrations are particularly apt to degenerate into criminal conduct when they leave the site of the grievance and become mobile.
Petty criminals and street people looking for excitement attach themselves like remora to the fringes of the crowd and use the protest as an excuse for rock throwing, auto trashing, arson, window breaking, looting, pocket picking and general hooliganism.
Soon the whole purpose of the demonstration is lost in mob mania.
There are better ways to promote a cause.
Where non-violent civil disobedience is the centerpiece, rather than a lawful demonstration that may only attract crime, it is difficult to justify.
Some find no harm in the misdemeanors of trespass, minor property destruction, blocking traffic and the like.
They say these are small prices to pay for galvanizing action for the all-important cause.
The crimes may appear small, but the prices can be huge.
Here are two cases to illustrate.
Assume a neighborhood demonstration to protest speeding on a certain road or a careless accident involving a police car.
The protesters lie down in the street, blocking traffic, and will not move until the authorities carry them away.
Assume that someone caught in the jam has a heart attack.
There is no way to get an ambulance in quickly to move him to a hospital.
He dies.
The demonstration was non-violent and involved only a simple misdemeanor, but its impact on that individual was violent and terminal.
Assume that a TV network is airing a celebrity interview program with a live audience.
The politician appearing is highly controversial and has recently generated a good deal of rancor amid certain groups.
In a planned protest against his appearance, several members of the studio audience chain themselves in front of the TV cameras in such a way that the program cannot continue.
The network must refund money to the advertisers and loses considerable revenue and prestige.
The demonstrators have been non-violent, but the result of their trespasses has been to seriously impair the rights of others unconnected with their dispute.
It might be alleged that TV has done more than its share to popularize and promote non-violent civil disobedience, so the second situation hypothesized above would be simply a case of "chickens coming home to roost."
Or maybe the TV network would lose nothing.
Geraldo or Phil would probably pull up another camera and interview the chained protesters.
Let us look for a moment at another type of non-violent civil disobedience that only harms other people indirectly, yet does irreparable damage to the nation as a whole.
I am referring to those young men who chose to disobey their country's call to arms during the Vietnam war and fled to Canada or some other sanctuary to avoid combat.
Their cowardly acts of civil disobedience, which they tried to hide under the cloak of outrage at a war they characterized as "immoral," weakened the national fabric and threw additional burdens on those who served honorably in that conflict.
Even more at fault are those leaders in and out of government who urged and supported their defections, thereby giving great help and comfort to the enemy propagandists.
It is amazing that the ensuing mass executions in Vietnam and Cambodia do not weight more heavily on minds so morally fine-tuned.
Worse, it remained to a well-meaning but naive president of the United States to administer the final infamy upon those who fought and died in Vietnam.
Under the guise of "healing the wounds of the nation," President Carter pardoned thousands of draft evaders, thus giving dignity to their allegations of the war's "immorality."
The precedent having been set, who can complain if future generations called upon to defend the U.S. yield to the temptation to avoid the danger of combat by simply declaring the war immoral and hiding until it is over?
Finally, I think it important to point out the extraordinarily high visibility of non-violent civil disobedience in these days of intensive media coverage.
Give television a chance to cover live any breaking of the law, and no second invitation will be required.
This brings into question the motives of those who lead civil disobedience demonstrations.
Do they want the spotlight for themselves or for their cause?
Here is a good rule of thumb: If the movement produced the leader, the chance that he is sincere is much greater than if the leader produced the movement.
In either case, ask yourself whether you have become better informed on the issues under protest by watching the act of civil disobedience.
If you have not, it is probable that a thorough airing of the dispute by calm and rational debate would have been the better course.
Mr. Agnew was vice president of the U.S. from 1969 until he resigned in 1973.
Gov. George Deukmejian and key legislators agreed to back a temporary one-quarter-cent increase in the state sales tax to raise $800 million for repairs and relief associated with last month's earthquake.
The tax increase, which will be considered at a special session of the state legislature that begins tomorrow, would cover only part of the estimated $4 billion to $6 billion in total damage caused by the Oct. 17 quake.
Aside from as much as $3.45 billion in recently approved federal aid, the state is expected to draw from a gubernatorial emergency fund that currently stands at an estimated $700 million.
"I am not aware that there is anything but bipartisan agreement for the general outline" of the revenue-raising plan, said a spokesman for the governor, after a Monday meeting with legislative leaders over the quake-relief question.
The tax increase -- on top of the current six-cent per dollar sales tax -- would become effective this Dec. 1 and expire Dec. 31, 1990.
The sales-tax plan was preferred over an alternative that would have boosted the state gasoline tax.
Some legislators expressed concern that a gas-tax increase would take too long and possibly damage chances of a major gas-tax-increasing ballot initiative that voters will consider next June.
Despite continuing problems in its newsprint business, Kimberly-Clark Corp. posted a 20% gain in third-quarter net income.
The consumer-products and newsprint company said net rose to $108.8 million, or $1.35 a share, from $90.5 million, or $1.12 a share, a year ago.
Sales rose 6.2% to $1.45 billion from $1.37 billion.
After a flat second quarter tied largely to lower newsprint earnings, Kimberly-Clark attributed the gain to improved results in its consumer businesses in North America, Brazil and Korea.
Those gains came from higher prices, particularly for disposable diapers and tissue products, and from increased sales, primarily for feminine-care products, the company said.
Newsprint results continued to be depressed, the company added, because of industrywide price discounting.
The quarter-to-quarter comparison was also enhanced by charges taken in the year-earlier period, including $11 million related to the modernization of a pulp and newsprint mill in Alabama.
In the 1989 period also, interest expense and tax rates were lower than a year ago.
In the first nine months, profit rose 10% to $313.2 million, or $3.89 a share, from $283.9 million, or $3.53 a share.
Sales rose 6.7% to $4.27 billion from $4 billion.
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Kimberly-Clark closed at $66.50 a share, up $1.50.
INTENSIVE AUDITS are coming to 55,500 taxpayers as research guinea pigs.
This is the year: Unsuspecting filers of 1988 personal returns are being picked randomly for thorough audits to help the IRS update its criteria for enforcement, audit selection, and use of resources.
The last Taxpayer Compliance Measurement Program survey covered 1985 returns.
The 1988-return project starts Jan. 1 and is to be done by May 31, 1991.
Specially trained IRS agents will look for under-reported income and unsupported deductions and credits.
The agents will make more than routine inquiries about such items as marital status and dependents; they want to look at living standards and business assets.
But they also are to see that taxpayers get all allowable tax benefits and to ask if filers who sought IRS aid were satisfied with it.
Courts have ruled that taxpayers must submit to TCMP audits, but the IRS will excuse from the fullscale rigors anyone who was audited without change for either 1986 or 1987.
Rewards have been suggested -- but never adopted -- for filers who come through TCMP audits without change.
PENALTY OVERHAUL is still likely, congressional sources say.
Long-debated proposals to simplify the more than 150 civil penalties and make them fairer and easier to administer are in the House tax bill.
But they were stripped from the Senate bill after staffers estimated penalty revenue would fall by $216 million over five years.
Still, congressional aides say penalty reform is a strong candidate for enactment, even if not this time around, although some provisions may be modified.
Sen. Pryor (D., Ark.), a leader on the issue who generally backs the House plan, wants some changes -- for one, separate sanctions for negligence and large misstatements of tax owed, not a single penalty.
He would ease the proposed penalties for delayed payroll-tax deposits and for faulty Form 1099 and other reports that taxpayers correct voluntarily.
The General Accounting Office urges Congress to ensure that all penalties retain their force as deterrents.
TAXPAYERS' RIGHTS are defined by a growing number of states.
The 1988 tax act created a federal bill of rights spelling out IRS duties to protect taxpayers' rights in the assessment and collection of taxes.
States are following suit.
California enacted a rights law in 1988.
In 1989, Illinois, Kansas, Ohio, Oregon and South Carolina have adopted rights laws, the Federation of Tax Administrators, a state officials' group, reports; the features vary.
And taxpayer groups are urging legislation in many other states.
One group is the Committee on State Taxation, which comprises 330 multistate corporations and advises the Council of State Chambers of Commerce.
The group's Mark Cahoon says its efforts begun in 1989 have led to the introduction of bills in Massachusetts, Minnesota and Colorado to establish evenhanded procedures affecting all kinds of taxpayers.
The group also seeks uniformity among states in provisions for taxpayers' rights.
This week, New York City announced a 10-point policy patterned on the federal bill of rights for taxpayers.
THE MILEAGE RATE allowed for business use of a car in 1989 has risen to 25.5 cents a mile for the first 15,000 from 24 cents in 1988, the IRS says; the rate stays 11 cents for each added mile.
Also unaltered: 12 cents for charitable activities and nine cents for medical and moving costs.
IRA BALANCES could be used to qualify for bank services under a bill entered by Reps. Chandler (R., Wash.) and Andrews (D., Texas).
The bill would thwart a recent Labor Department opinion that investing individual-retirement-account funds to earn free checking violates the law.
HUGO FELLED vast timberlands.
South Carolina's congressional delegation has entered Senate and House bills to provide special casualty-loss treatment and other tax relief for timber growers in the hurricane disaster areas.
HE RODE HIS HOBBY, but he couldn't milk it, the Tax Court says.
The court often weighs deductions of sideline-business costs: Do they stem from a profit-seeking activity or a nondeductible hobby?
But it's rare to see both functions in one case.
Charles O. Givens of Mount Vernon, Ind. - investment broker, ex-accountant, and son of a former stable owner-bred Tennessee Walking Horses for six years, raised cattle for four, and never made a profit on either.
He claimed losses totaling $42,455 -- and the IRS denied them all.
Special Judge Galloway noted that Givens managed horse-breeding in a businesslike way: He kept detailed accounts, practiced soil conservation, enhanced his experience by consulting experts, spent several hours a day doing chores, and dropped the sideline when his best brood mare died.
Yet he took little businesslike care with his cattle: He had no prior experience and didn't seek business counsel about them.
The judge said Givens may deduct his $30,180 of losses from horse breeding, but rejected the $12,275 in deductions from the cattle operation.

The U.S. and Finland signed an income-tax treaty, subject to ratification.
An arbitrator awarded Eastern Airlines pilots between $60 million and $100 million in back pay, a decision that could complicate the carrier's bankruptcy-law reorganization.
Eastern, a unit of Texas Air Corp., said it is examining the ruling to determine if it can appeal.
It's unclear whether Eastern will succeed in overturning the arbitrator's decision, made in a long-simmering "pay parity" dispute that predates both the carrier's Chapter 11 petition and its 1986 acquisition by Texas Air.
All Eastern's previous court efforts to head off the pilots' demands have failed.
An Eastern spokesman said he doesn't expect that the arbitrator's ruling "will have any overall material effect on the company's strategic plan."
Bankruptcy experts said the law isn't clear on how such an arbitration ruling can affect a company's case.
Like any other creditor, the pilots will have to apply to the court for payment of their claim.
That may leave a lot of leeway for U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland to decide what, if anything, the pilots actually collect.
In August, he issued the ruling that let the pilots pursue their back-pay grievance before the arbitrator.
The pilots' contract with Eastern calls for a mutually acceptable private arbitrator to resolve such grievances.
In a statement to employees, Eastern said the company was disappointed by the ruling.
"The obligation is totally unwarranted," the statement said.
James Linsey, a lawyer for the Air Line Pilots Association, said the pilots were extremely pleased.
"This is a blow not only to Eastern but to the creditors committee," he said.
Eastern's creditors committee, along with the company, has consistently opposed the pilots' claim, which if paid would have to come out of money both hope to use to pay off other bankruptcy claims.
Eastern and its creditors are in the final, delicate stages of negotiating a second reorganization plan to pay off the airline's debts.
An earlier plan, which had received the creditors' approval in July, fell apart when Eastern changed its business plan.
It isn't known whether the pilot claim was figured into either plan.
The dispute between Eastern and its pilots is over a "pay parity" clause in the pilots' contract.
The clause was part of an agreement in which pilots accepted a substantial pay cut as long as no other labor group got a raise.
Shortly after Texas Air took control of Eastern, some Machinists union supervisors received a 20% pay raise.
The pilots argued that this triggered a pay raise for them.
Eastern has disputed the claim, but a federal district court, an appeals court and now the arbitrator have all sided with the pilots.
The two sides don't even agree about how much money is at issue.
The pilots put the amount as high as $100 million, the company at $65 million.
Another arbitrator is hearing another pay parity case between Eastern and its pilots, resulting from a similar set of circumstances involving a separate pay raise granted another union.
A decision on that case isn't expected before mid-November.
Ironically, many of the pilots involved have left Eastern or are still striking the carrier, which filed for bankruptcy protection March 9.
About 800 have crossed the picket lines and returned to work.
Few people in the advertising business have raised as many hackles as Alvin A. Achenbaum.
The general public may not know his name, but he's famous -- make that infamous -- in advertising circles: A marketing consultant, he pioneered slashing ad agency commissions, to the delight of advertising clients and the dismay of agencies.
Now, after beating them, Mr. Achenbaum is joining them.
Backer Spielvogel Bates Worldwide named Mr. Achenbaum, 62, vice chairman of professional services, reporting directly to Carl Spielvogel, chairman and chief executive officer.
He joins Nov. 13, dissolving his consulting firm, Canter, Achenbaum Associates.
In years past, the ad industry's most distinguished executives didn't hesitate to excorciate Mr. Achenbaum.
They have since mellowed, although one senior Young & Rubicam executive, echoing others, said: "I think ad agencies owe Carl {Spielvogel} a vote of thanks for getting him out of the consulting business."
But industry executives also believe hiring Mr. Achenbaum is a shrewd move for Backer Spielvogel, a unit of Saatchi & Saatchi.
Mr. Achenbaum has counted among his clients some of the most visible blue-chip advertisers in the country, including Nissan, Toyota, Seagram and Backer Spielvogel clients Hyundai and J.P. Morgan.
At Backer Spielvogel, he will work with clients and potential clients on marketing strategies; aside from agency compensation issues, he helped Nissan, for example, come up with its positioning and pricing for its new Infiniti line.
His client contacts, meanwhile, could prove a gold mine for an agency that has had few new business wins of late.
"I've done over 40 ad agency searches {for clients}, so I have a pretty good notion of what clients are interested in when they look for an agency," Mr. Achenbaum said.
As a consultant, he has given seminars at agencies including Ogilvy & Mather on how to win new business.
Mr. Spielvogel said he hopes Mr. Achenbaum will do some strategic consulting at the agency for "non-clients, in hopes that they become clients."
At Backer Spielvogel, Mr. Spielvogel's hallmark has been personal involvement with all major clients.
He pampers them; he invites them to fabulous parties; he strokes them.
Mr. Achenbaum, too, delves into his clients' business.
"Carl has a much higher degree of intimacy with his clients than is ordinary for an agency his size.
And with Al's record of being a delver and a detail guy, you can see how the two fit," said Alan Gottesman, an analyst with PaineWebber.
Mr. Achenbaum's move follows the announcement last month that his consulting partner, Stanley Canter, 66, would retire.
When the announcement came out, "I picked up the phone and said, `Why don't you come to us?' '' Mr. Spielvogel said.
Mr. Achenbaum, who had been considering paring down his firm or merging it with another small consulting outfit, soon agreed.
The two men are longtime friends and tennis partners, having met about 25 years ago.
Before becoming a consultant in 1974, Mr. Achenbaum was a senior executive at J. Walter Thompson Co.
He spent most of his career formulating marketing strategies, but became best-known for chipping away at ad agency compensation.
Ad agencies typically earned a straight 15% commission; if a client spent $100 million on TV time, the agency made $15 million.
But Mr. Achenbaum pioneered negotiated fees, which often worked out to less than 15%.
More recently, he negotiated "indemnification" clauses in which an ad agency in some cases must pay a client if it drops the account.
He ultimately became so well-known for cutting compensation, however, that clients didn't seek him out for anything else.
"I was very frustrated," he said.
"The fact of the matter is, I am a marketer.
That's another reason {for the Backer Spielvogel job}.
It struck me as a way to get back to what I really want to do."
Mr. Spielvogel added pointedly: "The pressure on commissions didn't begin with Al Achenbaum."
Mr. Spielvogel said Mr. Achenbaum will work with clients to determine the mix of promotion, merchandising, publicity and other marketing outlets, and to integrate those services.
He will concentrate on, among others, J.P. Morgan and Hyundai.
Mr. Achenbaum helped Morgan in its recent agency search, and he has a long relationship with Hyundai, which is having severe troubles, including declining sales.
"The trail of revenue is increasingly going away from pure advertising, and going towards other services," Mr. Spielvogel said.
Instead of being just an ad agency, he said: "We have redefined our mission here.
Our mission is to help our clients grow, and to use every tool of marketing communications to accomplish that."
Industry executives are wishing Mr. Achenbaum well.
Leonard Matthews, then-president of the American Association of Advertising Agencies, called Mr. Achenbaum a "quisling" in an incendiary 1987 speech.
Yesterday, Mr. Matthews, now a consultant with the Stamford, Conn., firm Matthews & Johnston, quipped, "I think he'll be very good at that {new job}.
And much better at that than at {the price-cutting} he's been doing recently."
Cotton Inc., the fiber company that represents cotton growers, will begin a new ad campaign, developed by Ogilvy & Mather, Thanksgiving Day.
J. Nicholas Hahn, Cotton Inc.'s president and chief executive, was an outspoken critic of WPP Group's acquisition of Ogilvy Group earlier this year.
During the takeover, Mr. Hahn said he would put his account up for review if WPP's bid were successful, but he didn't.
Cotton Inc.'s new $9 million campaign calls cotton the "Fabric of Our Lives."
The campaign replaces its "Take Comfort in Cotton" ads and marks the end of its national cooperative advertising efforts.
For years, the company's ads were tied in with pitches for Cannon sheets or Martex towels, for example, and an announcer at the end of the ads would tell customers where to "find the true performance label."
With the new TV spots, Ogilvy & Mather has opted for a family style with lots of laughter, hugs and tears.
"We're making a fairly obvious plea for some emotional reaction," says Tom Rost, creative director at Ogilvy & Mather.
Cotton Inc. will spend nearly $2 million on broadcasting on Thanksgiving Day alone, advertising on such programs as "Good Morning America," "Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade" and the NFL holiday game.
Frank L. Mingo, one of the pioneers of advertising targeted at black audiences, died at the age of 49 after a stroke.
Mr. Mingo was chief executive officer of the Mingo Group, which he founded in 1977 and which created ads for the black market.
Clients include Miller Brewing Co. and General Motors.
Mr. Mingo was hospitalized Sept. 23 and died Monday, according to Samuel J. Chisholm, the agency's president and chief operating officer.

Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's leader and one of Asia's leading statesmen for 30 years, recently announced his intention to retire next year -- though not necessarily to end his influence.
The prime minister, whose hair is thinning and gray and whose face has a perpetual pallor, nonetheless continues to display an energy, a precision of thought and a willingness to say publicly what most other Asian leaders dare say only privately.
The 66-year-old Mr. Lee recently spent an hour discussing the state of Asia and the world with two Journal reporters in his plainly furnished, wood-paneled office.
The interview did not touch on Singapore's domestic affairs.
Skipping personal pleasantries, Mr. Lee picked up exactly where he left off several months earlier -- before the government crackdown in China -- when he had warned that the orthodox leadership in Beijing feared a plurality of views.
On China's turmoil: "It is a very unhappy scene," he said.
"It took Zhao Ziyang (former premier and party chief) 10 years to build a team of economists who understood how the Western economies work and now that team is part in exile, part being rusticated and part missing."
Rebuilding that team, Mr. Lee predicted, will take another 10 years.
"That's very sad for China and for Asia because China could have been a good engine for growth, not just for Hong Kong and Taiwan but for Japan, Korea and the rest of Asia."
On similarities between China and the Soviet Union: "In important particulars, the Soviets are different from the Chinese.
They are already industrialized....
Their problem is one of inefficiency of an industrial economy.
The Chinese problem is much greater -- it's how to industrialize to begin with."
Asked if the Soviets, like Chinese officials, won't one day face a similar conflict between the desire to liberalize economically and yet retain political control, Mr. Lee said, "I would think that the Soviets face a deeper dilemma because they have been more in blinkers than the Chinese -- I mean keeping their people cut off from the outside world."
Mikhail Gorbachev, he said, is ahead of China's leaders in his awareness of the world.
"But I think the Soviet peoples are more introverted than the Chinese."
Regardless, he said, he still believes the Soviet Union, while falling far short of the efficiency of a Western economy, may well manage to improve considerably.
On Asia-Pacific prosperity: "If America can keep up the present situation -- her markets open for another 15 years, with adjustments, and Japan can grow and not cut back, and so too, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, ASEAN, Australia and New Zealand -- then in 15 years, the economies of these countries would be totally restructured to be able to almost sustain growth by themselves."
In such an arrangement, "all benefit," he said.
"And if the Europeans come in, they benefit too.
It's not a zero-sum game."
Asked about the possibility of greater economic cooperation among Asia-Pacific nations, which will be discussed Nov. 6 and 7 at a ministerial meeting in Canberra, Mr. Lee said the goal "is to have a free and open world trading system."
An Asian bloc isn't intended, he said.
"That's not possible."
On U.S.-Japan relations: "I'm encouraged.
I think the earlier strident notes struck by {U.S. Commerce Secretary Robert} Mosbacher and {U.S. Trade Representative} Carla Hills have been more rounded.
I believe the U.S. is becoming more patient and circumspect," he said.
"It's the total relationship that is important."
The total relationship, as Mr. Lee sees it, is "the flow of dollars to the U.S. to fund the deficits, the investments the Japanese are making in the U.S. in order to satisfy American demand that American products consumed in America should be made as much as possible in America by Americans with Japanese technology and capital."
Japan's recent political turbulence, Mr. Lee said, may mean Japan will slow market adjustments.
"They'll be more timorous in tackling their own voters, like opening up more to agricultural imports from America, hurting their farmers."
On U.S. military presence in Asia: Asked if his offer to allow the American military to use facilities in Singapore would help preserve America's presence in the region at bases in the Philippines, he said, "What we have done is make it easier for the Philippines to continue to host American bases without it being said they are lackeys of the imperialists and the only ones in Asia or in Southeast Asia.
We are willing to share the political burden of being host to America, an imperial power.
We think it isn't such a great burden, that it carries no stigma, and we are prepared to do it."
On U.S.-Philippine relations: "It's such a mixed-up relationship going back into history....
I really do not understand how it is that Filipinos feel so passionately involved in this father figure that they want to dispose of and yet they need.
I just don't understand it.
My relationships with the British are totally different.
They lorded it over me.
They did me some good.
They did themselves even more good.
They let me down when the Japanese came down {during World War II}....
I don't feel down or done in because I show British serials on my television network or read their books.
I mean it is a normal adult relationship.
"But the Filipinos and the Americans, when I talk to them, there's so much passion about Filipino manhood being diminished as a result of being squatted upon by the Americans and so on.
The occasional Englishman tries to put on airs but we let it pass....
It's just comic when they try to pretend they're still the master race."
Mr. Lee added that the Filipinos are "making it very difficult" for the U.S. military presence to last beyond five or 10 years.
On military alternatives if the U.S. pulls back: "The Soviets already are present.
I suppose sooner or later, the Japanese would have to fill up a large part of the gap on the naval side.
Maybe the Chinese, maybe even the Indians."
On economic consequences of a diminished U.S. presence: "America is the only major power in recent history that has used its military might to sustain a system that enables all participants to equally benefit without her as the provider of the security taking royalties."
Asked why so few nations seem to share his views of America, he said, "Many people see it that way.
But they have just taken it for granted."
On Cambodia: "Let's assume that {former Cambodian leader Prince Norodom} Sihanouk does what the press wants him to do and joins up with {Vietnamese-backed Cambodian leader} Hun Sen.
Is the trouble over?
Can Sihanouk and Hun Sen knock off the Khmer Rouge still supported by China?
He can't.
"What is the way forward?
To get the Khmer Rouge as part of a process for elections.
And when they lose, then we can expect China to stop aid.
Let's put it bluntly.
The Chinese cannot be seen to have made use of the Khmer Rouge and then discard them."

Everything looked good as neurosurgeon Walter Levy and colleagues carefully cut away a woman's spinal tumor at the Cleveland Clinic in 1978.
Using small electrical shocks applied to her feet, they were able to monitor sensory nerves.
The shocks generated nerve impulses that traveled via spine to brain and showed up clearly on a brain-wave monitor, indicating no damage to the delicate spinal tissue.
Then, says Dr. Levy, "she woke up paralyzed."
The damage was to her motor nerves, which couldn't be monitored along with the sensory nerves, he explains.
The tragedy, he adds, "galvanized me" to look for a way to prevent similar cases.
Dr. Levy's answer may come with a new kind of magnetic brain probe, a device that he and dozens of U.S. researchers are studying with great hope.
Besides holding the promise of safer spinal surgery, the probe could improve the diagnosis of brain and nerve disorders such as strokes and multiple sclerosis.
Perhaps most exciting, the device is thrusting open a window to the workings of the brain.
The probe, which is painless, non-invasive and apparently harmless, employs strong magnetic fields to induce small whirlwinds of electricity within the brain.
If positioned over the brain's motor-control area, the hand-held electromagnets generate nerve impulses that zip down motor nerves and activate muscles, making, say, a finger twitch.
In principle, they will enable doctors to check the body's motor system the way an electrician tests a home's electrical circuits by running current through them.
"Until now, we've had no objective way of measuring motor function," says Keith Chiappa, a neurologist conducting clinical tests with the devices at Boston's Massachusetts General Hospital.
"Under the best circumstances such tests are subjective; when a patient is unconscious, they don't work at all.
Magnetic brain tweaking started in the early 1900s, when researchers produced flashes of light in the visual field with magnets.
In the 1960s, Mayo Clinic researchers developed magnetic devices to stimulate motor nerves in the hand and other limbs.
But for brain tests, the unwieldy machines "would have required patients to stand on their heads," says Reginald Bickford, a researcher at the University of California at San Diego.
The field took off in 1985 after scientists at Britain's Sheffield University developed a handy, compact magnet for brain stimulation.
Since then, at least two commercial versions have been put on the U.S. market, and an estimated 500 have been sold.
In August, a Chicago conference on such devices attracted more than 100 researchers, who reported studies on everything from brain mapping to physical therapy.
"We don't feel we can use {the devices} routinely in surgery yet, but we're getting close," says Dr. Levy, who is now with the University of Pittsburgh.
A problem, he adds, is that anesthetized brains are more resistant to magnetic stimulation than awake ones.
The devices could help indicate when surgery would help, says Charles Tator, a University of Toronto neurosurgeon.
For example, paralyzed car-crash victims occasionally have some intact spinal tissues that, if preserved by emergency surgery, enable partial recovery.
But such operations typically aren't performed because there is no sign right after an injury that surgery would be beneficial.
"The cost {of magnetic stimulators} would seem like peanuts if we could retrieve limb function" in such people, Dr. Tator says.
Scientists caution there is a chance the magnet technique might spark seizures in epileptics.
But no significant problems have been reported among hundreds of people tested with the devices.
The main sensation, besides feeling like a puppet jerked with invisible strings, is "like a rap on the head," says Sam Bridgers, a neurologist who has studied the brain stimulators at Yale University.
One apparent side effect is a minor increase in a brain hormone.
And some doctors who have conducted hours of tests on themselves report temporary headaches.
At least two companies, Cadwell Laboratories Inc. of Kennewick, Wash., and Novametrix Medical Systems Inc. of Wallingford, Conn., now sell versions of the magnetic devices.
The machines, which at $12,500 are inexpensive by medical standards, haven't been approved in the U.S. for marketing as brain stimulators but are sold for stimulating nerves in the hand, legs and other non-brain areas.
Researchers can apply for permission to use the probes for brain studies.
At the University of Kentucky, a team led by Dean Currier, a physical therapy researcher, is testing the stimulators in conjunction with electric shocks to induce muscle contractions to help prevent wasting of thigh muscles after knee surgery.
Similarly, a Purdue University team led by heart researcher W.A. Tacker hopes to develop ways to magnetically induce cardiac muscle contractions.
The devices might someday serve as temporary pacemakers or restarters for stopped hearts, says Dr. Tacker, whose prototype was dubbed the "Tacker whacker."
The devices' most remarkable possibilities, though, involve the brain.
Probing with the stimulators, National Institutes of Health scientists recently showed how the brain reorganizes motor-control resources after an amputation.
Similar studies are expected to reveal how stroke patients' brains regroup -- a first step toward finding ways to bolster that process and speed rehabilitation.
Scientists also are exploring memory and perception with the new machines.
At the State University of New York at Brooklyn, researchers flash two groups of different letters on a computer screen in front of human guinea pigs.
Between flashes, certain areas in subjects' brains are jolted with a magnetic stimulator.
When the jolt is timed just right, the subjects don't recall seeing the first group of letters.
"Where does that first stimulus go?" exclaims SUNY neurologist Paul Maccabee.
"Trying to answer that is suggesting all kinds of theories," such as precisely where and how the brain processes incoming signals from the eyes.
He and others say that the machines are weak enough that they don't jeopardize the memory.
Both the SUNY team and researchers at the National Magnet Laboratory in Cambridge, Mass., are working with more potent magnetic brain stimulators.
Among other things, the stronger devices may be able to summon forth half-forgotten memories and induce mood changes, neurologists say.
Du Pont Co., Hewlett-Packard Co. and Los Alamos National Laboratory said they signed a three-year, $11 million agreement to collaborate on superconductor research.
The collaboration will include at least 25 researchers and will be aimed primarily at developing thin films of high-temperature superconductors for use in electronics, the companies said.
The materials, discovered during the past three years, conduct electricity without resistance and promise smaller, faster computers and other new technologies.
Joint-research programs have proliferated as U.S. companies seek to spread the risks and costs of commercializing new superconductors and to meet the challenges posed by foreign consortia, especially in Japan.
The latest research pact bolsters Du Pont's growing portfolio of investments in superconductors.
The Wilmington, Del., chemicals concern previously signed research superconductor agreements with Oak Ridge National Laboratory and with Argonne National Laboratory.
Last year, Du Pont agreed to pay $4.5 million for rights to superconductor work at the University of Houston.
Hewlett-Packard is a Palo Alto, Calif., computer maker.
The Los Alamos laboratory is one of three U.S. Department of Energy national laboratories designed as pilot centers to foster joint industry-government programs to speed the transfer of new superconductors to the marketplace.
J.C. PENNEY Co., Dallas, said it issued $350 million of securities backed by credit-card receivables.
The offering was priced with an 8.95% coupon rate at 99.1875% to yield 9.19%.
The retailer said the securities are expected to be rated triple-A by Standard & Poor's Corp. and Aaa by Moody's Investors Service Inc.
They pay interest only for 115 months, with principal payments beginning thereafter.
The expected average life of the certificates is 10 years, with the final scheduled payment in October, 2001.
First Boston Corp. is sole underwriter.
As part of the transaction, J.C. Penney will sell a portion of its credit-card receivables to its JCP Receivables Inc. unit, which will then transfer them to a master trust.
The trust will issue the certificates.
Credit support will be provided by a letter of credit facility from Credit Suisse in favor of the trustee, Fuji Bank & Trust Co., for the benefit of the certificate holders.
J.C. Penney will continue to service the receivables.
