    <HEADLINE>QIAN QICHEN DUBIOUS OF NEW US-JAPAN DEFENSE GUIDELINES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo, Oct. 1 (CNA)
(By Lai Sheng-chuan &amp; Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen
was highly skeptical of Tokyo's explanations of the content of the
newly published US-Japan guidelines for defense cooperation when he
met Monday in Beijing with representatives of Japan's press.</P>
      <P>Qian also said the time is not ripe yet for a trilateral official
dialogue among Washington, Beijing and Tokyo on defense, adding that
"scholarly discussion" would be appropriate at the present.</P>
      <P>Qian's remarks indicate that despite explanations of the new
guidelines by Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and Foreign
Minister Keizo Obuchi, Beijing is still very worried about whether
Taiwan falls within the sphere of the bilateral defense agreement.</P>
      <P>According to reports in the Japanese media, among Qian's concerns
are:</P>
      <P>-- If the defense pact is a matter between Washington and Tokyo,
it should be unnecessary to renew it, hence putting its content into
doubt.</P>
      <P>-- Although the new guidelines do not specifically mention
geographic criteria, there is still speculation that they cover
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>-- Some have argued for raising the transparency of the bilateral
agreement, while others advocate keeping it ambiguous and opaque.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AMCHAM CALLS FOR EARLY CONCLUSION OF ROC-US WTO TALKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 1 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) in
Taipei on Wednesday appealed for an early conclusion of trade
consultations between the United States and the Republic of China on
terms for Taiwan to join the World Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>AmCham President Jeffrey R. Williams told a news conference that
all AmCham members hope bilateral ROC-US WTO talks will be concluded
as soon as possible to facilitate Taiwan's entry to the Geneva-based
world trade regulatory body.</P>
      <P>According to Williams, most American business people with
interests in Taiwan are convinced that they will benefit from
Taiwan's WTO accession because Taiwan would be required to further
open its market and better protect intellectual property rights.</P>
      <P>Williams, who just returned from a "doorknocking" visit to
Washington, D.C. at the head of a 12-member AmCham delegation, said
the US executive branch agreed with AmCham that Taiwan's WTO
accession should not be linked to mainland China's membership
application.</P>
      <P>"We agree that Taiwan's WTO entry should be considered completely
on the basis of its own economic conditions," Williams said, adding
that Taiwan is likely to conclude WTO-related trade consultations
with the United States before the end of bilateral WTO talks between
Washington and Beijing.</P>
      <P>During its stay in the United States, the AmCham delegation met
with many Clinton administration officials and Congress members to
exchange views on ways to help American corporations upgrade their
overseas competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Williams said the AmCham mission had urged various US federal
agencies to allow their senior officials to make frequent visits to
Taiwan to help boost bilateral trade and economic cooperation for
mutual benefits.</P>
      <P>Even though the Clinton administration was busy preparing for
mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin's planned visit to the United
States late this month, Williams said, many federal government
officials still showed keen interest in listening to AmCham's
suggestions and opinions about reinforcing Taipei-Washington trade
and economic ties.</P>
      <P>As to the AmCham 1997-98 Taiwan White Paper, which he formally
unveiled at a news conference held in Washington, D.C. last Thursday,
Williams said the annual report mainly analyzed Taiwan's current
economic and investment climate as a reference for American companies
intending to invest in Taiwan, adding that the White Paper was not
aimed at criticizing any party.</P>
      <P>The White Paper said Taiwan's restrictions on trade and
investment across the Taiwan Strait have not only hindered the
development of its own industries but have also discouraged
multinational business groups from setting up a foothold on the
island. It further claimed that the ROC government's master plan to
develop Taiwan into an Asia-Pacific operations center would remain a
pipe dream if Taiwan companies are not allowed to enter the vast
mainland market directly and obtain access to its resources.</P>
      <P>Williams said AmCham's analysis was made purely from a commercial
viewpoint, adding that AmCham members believe Taiwan must establish
direct communications and transport links with mainland China so that
Taiwan-based companies can make successful inroads into the world's
largest market.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EVERGREEN TO BUILD WORLD'S 3RD LARGEST CONTAINER PORT IN ITALY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Rome,  Sept.  30  (CNA)
(By H.T. Chung &amp; Debbie Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Evergreen's green-colored ships and green
matchbox-like containers are the hope of the port of Gioia Tauro in
southern Italy.</P>
      <P>Taiwan-based Evergreen Marine Corp., which operates one of the
largest container fleets in the world, is wagering on Gioia Tauro, a
newly-developed and non-urban port area, attempting to build it into
the third largest container port in the world.</P>
      <P>Evergreen is also targeting Gioia Tauro as a gateway to all
Mediterranean-rim states and the Black Sea to the north, said a
company spokesman.</P>
      <P>The Italian government has put up nearly US$180 million since
1975 to develop the quiet backwater fishing port into a commercial
harbor. With most parts of the development already finished, the
harbor accommodated some 1,270 ships in the first six months of this
year. The harbor bureau there estimated that its transshipment
capacity may reach 1.4 million TEUs this year.</P>
      <P>Although the port is fully operational, its peripheral facilities
are still in dire need of help, Aldo Alessio, mayor of Gioia Tauro,
lamented. He noted that many support works have been left unfinished
due to budget constraints, with highways in the vicinity only four
meters wide and the nearby hinterland remaining undeveloped and
blanketed by weeds.</P>
      <P>Taipei's representative office in Rome, which has generally been
reluctant to beckon Taiwan investors to Italy for fear that the
European country's labor union clout and chronically inefficient
bureaucracy may hinder their development, has championed Evergreen's
container port project in Gioia Tauro.</P>
      <P>Joe Hung, Taipei representative in Italy, said Evergreen made the
right decision by choosing Gioia Tauro. As long as there is no major
strike problem, chances for the project's success are great, he said,
noting that the port of Gioia Tauro is strategically positioned and
has the full support of the Italian government.</P>
      <P>While Evergreen's arrival in Gioia Tauro brings hope to people in
southern Italy, the move also stimulates Taiwan investors to look
toward Italy, enabling them to have other choices beyond mainland
China, Southeast Asia and Latin America, Hung said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN ENTITLED TO EQUAL APEC REPRESENTATION: P.K. CHIANG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 1 (CNA)
(By Debbie Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan should be treated the same as all 17
other members in meetings of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) forum even if the gatherings are held in Beijing, Taipei's
arch rival, said P.K. Chiang, chairman of the Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD), on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chiang made the remarks in an interpellation session before the
Legislative Yuan's Economic Affairs Committee, during which
Legislator Yen Chin-fu of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party
asked him what Taiwan would do if Beijing sponsors the 2001 APEC
meeting and demands that Taiwan take part in the gathering as a local
economic entity of the People's Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Chiang said it is still too early to speculate on who will host
the 2001 APEC meeting.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, a full APEC member, has taken part in all eight APEC
ministerial-level meetings in the past as a sovereign economic entity
with a status equal to that of every other APEC member, Chiang said.
"Things didn't change in the past and they won't change in the
future," he said.</P>
      <P>No matter who sponsors the 2001 gathering, no APEC member should
violate the principles of the organization's establishment, which
champion equality and cooperation, Chiang noted.</P>
      <P>Chiang, who led the Chinese Taipei delegation to the 1996 APEC
annual meeting held in the Philippines, recalled that mainland
Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen spoke at a
joint press conference then to downgrade Taiwan's legitimate status
at the organization.</P>
      <P>Chiang said he rebuked Qian for the remarks and reiterated that
Taiwan's APEC status is both legitimate and unchangeable.</P>
      <P>Chiang said his speech received wide support from many other
member countries.</P>
      <P>APEC groups 18 economies: Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Hong
Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, mainland China, Mexico, New
Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea,

    <HEADLINE>6.7 PERCENT GROWTH IN 1997 FEASIBLE, SAYS TOP PLANNER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 1 (CNA)
(By Debbie Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With this being a year of economic recovery,
6.7 percent annual economic growth in 1997 is feasible, Taiwan's top
economic planner said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>P.K. Chiang, chairman of the Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD), said that with growth in the second
half of the year forecast to reach 6.56 percent, annual growth should
top 6.58 percent in 1997, which would be the seventh highest in the
world and a five-year high in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chiang gave the figures in a report on national economic
prospects before the Legislative Economic Affairs Committee.</P>
      <P>To accelerate the pace of the recovery, he said, the government
will continue promoting public construction projects as well as
stimulating private investment.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chiang underlined several other factors fueling the
domestic economy, including the commencement of private-run power
plants and intelligent industrial parks islandwide, the level of
private investment in high-tech industries remaining high, and export
businesses continuing to pick up steam.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  1  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>At least 5,000 people are arrested every
month islandwide for taking illegal drugs, according to the
Department of Health (DOH).</P>
      <P>Li Chih-heng, head of the DOH's Narcotics Bureau, warned on
Tuesday that half of those arrested are repeat offenders, indicating
that current anti-drug efforts haven't been able to reduce the number
of drug users in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Based on the previous figures, the DOH estimates that Taiwan has
over 200,000 residents who take illegal drugs, or about 1 percent of
the island's population, Li said at an anti-drug conference in
Taipei.</P>
      <P>Noting that smoking cigarettes and chewing betel nuts often
precedes illegal drug use, Li said that an important step to keep
away from drugs is to "say no to smoking."</P>
      <P>Betel nuts, or "Chinese chewing gum" as they are sometimes called
in Taiwan, are chewed for their stimulant effect and are addictive.
Chewing betel nuts can lead to oral cancer.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEXT SPRING IS GOOD TIME FOR RESUMPTION OF CROSS-STRAIT TALKS: KOO</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  1  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Next spring would be a good time for the
resumption of dialogue across the Taiwan Strait which was suspended
by Beijing following ROC President Lee Teng-hui's visit to the United
States in June 1995, Koo Chen-fu, chairman of the Taipei-based
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The time for the resumption of cross-strait negotiation is
"almost near, while the two sides are patiently creating a favorable
climate" for dialogue to take place, Koo told reporters, revealing
that mainland China has shown willingness to talk.</P>
      <P>He also said that he believes there is no need for Taiwan and
mainland China to set up a new channel for future negotiations,
stressing that they should still be conducted by the two existing
intermediary bodies -- the SEF and mainland China's Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) -- both semi-official
organizations set up to handle cross-strait exchanges in the absence
of official relations.</P>
      <P>Questioned on possible topics for future talks, Koo said that at
the moment, there should be no problem for the two sides to hold
talks on practical and economic issues. However, engagement in
political negotiations will require the support of public opinion, he
added.</P>
      <P>Mainland Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen recently
has commented that the two sides should open political dialogue as
soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Koo revealed that a key meeting of the National
Unification Council is expected to be held following a US visit by
mainland President Jiang Zemin later this month. He said President
Lee is expected to deliver an important speech to the meeting.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN HOSPITAL PERFORMS 100TH HEART TRANSPLANT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  1  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A medical team at the Chenghsin Medical
Center (CMC) in suburban Taipei successfully performed its 100th
heart transplant operation on Wednesday, nine years after the
hospital pioneered this type of surgery in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A hospital spokesman said the patient, identified only by his
surname of Pai, had suffered from an enlarged heart for five years.
He was transferred to Chenghsin from another local hospital in August
to receive a transplant. The medical center obtained a donated heart
on Tuesday and completed the transplant operation early Wednesday
morning.</P>
      <P>"The patient is now recuperating in an intensive care ward, where
his condition is stable," CMC President Wei Cheng said.</P>
      <P>According to Wei, 85 of the 100 people who have received new
hearts at the CMC over the past nine years are still alive, while the
center has a one-year survival rate of 94 percent and a three-year
survival rate of 84 percent, the highest in Asia and even higher than
the world average one-year survival rate of 82 percent, Wei added.</P>
      <P>The oldest recipient was 75 at the time of his operation and the
youngest was only 15, Wei said, adding that the oldest surviving
patient is now 67 years old.</P>
      <P>The CMC is also the only local hospital which has used an
artificial heart to help a patient survive the waiting time for a
donor heart for permanent transplant, Wei said, pointing out that
some patients died die before a suitable donor organ became
available.</P>
      <P>The CMC held a cocktail reception on Wednesday to celebrate its
100th heart transplant, which was attended by many of the surviving
transplant recipients.</P>
      <P>Addressing the occasion, Wei called on local residents to support
the organ donation drive to give new leases of life to people with
serious illnesses.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PANAMA SAID TO MAINTAIN DIPLOMATIC TIES WITH TAIPEI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Sept.  30  (CNA)
(By Bill Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Panama's foreign minister said here
Tuesday that as his country is assuming control of the Panama Canal,
it would try to maintain close relations with all users of the canal,
including mainland China, but "that should not, in any way, affect or
would affect the good friendship and diplomatic relationship we
maintain with the Republic of China on Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Ricardo Alberto Arias made the remarks to reporters after paying
a call on Jason Hu, Taipei's representative to the United States.</P>
      <P>Arias failed to speak in support of Taipei's membership in the
United Nations when he addressed the UN General Assembly last Friday.
The ROC now maintains diplomatic ties with only 30 countries, and
whether a country is willing to speak on behalf of its UN bid is
frequently taken as an indication of how solid the relationship is.</P>
      <P>Arias' failure to voice public support for Taipei's UN membership
struck an especially sensitive cord in Taiwan because his speech came
on the heels of a meeting with Beijing's foreign minister, Qian
Qichen. Taipei, still basking in the afterglow of President Lee
Teng-hui's visit to Panama earlier this month for an international
meeting on the canal, was caught off guard.</P>
      <P>Arias said he did not discuss Taiwan with Qian, adding that they
talked only about the canal's reversion to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999,
the need for establishing and maintaining lines of communication
between their two governments given the importance of the canal issue
to both, and Panama's commercial office in Hong Kong, which had been
a consulate but shed its official status following the former British
colony's reversion to Beijing's rule on July 1.</P>
      <P>The foreign minister also denied knowledge of any plan for Qian
to visit Panama later this year as reported in the press, saying that
Qian did not mention anything about a visit to Panama.</P>
      <P>Asked why he decided not to mention Taiwan in his speech, Arias
said that Panama is assuming control of the canal and, therefore,
must refrain from taking positions on issues of international
conflicts in accordance with a 1978 treaty with the United States
that guarantees the neutrality of the canal after its transfer.</P>
      <P>In addition, he said, a major debate at the current UN General
Assembly session is about amendments to the UN Charter that would
limit the availability of assistance to developing countries, and it
was important for Panama, which will host the next secretariat of the
Rio Group, a Latin American grouping, to address that issue.</P>
      <P>He said that his speech was devoted mostly to the amendments
issue with a brief mention of the canal at the end. The Taiwan issue
would not fit into the speech as it did not address any other
international matters that are being considered by the world body,
such as the issue of land mines or Cyprus, he argued.</P>
      <P>He said that Panama has always spoken at the United Nations and
different forums in support of universal UN participation, and this
position remains unchanged.</P>
      <P>Arias, a former ambassador to the United States, first met Hu
when they served together in Washington last year. Coincidentally, Hu
has also been appointed foreign minister and is expected to assume
his new duties in Taipei next month.</P>
      <P>The outgoing Taipei representative said he appreciates the
goodwill and sincerity shown by the Panamanian foreign minister but
that he cannot fully agree with Arias' course of action.</P>
      <P>Hu said he is neither optimistic nor pessimistic about the future
of diplomatic ties between their two countries. "What is important,"
he added, "is to do all we can to further promote the bilateral
relationship."</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC ECONOMIC MINISTER UNVEILS SIX MAJOR POLICY DIRECTIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei  Oct. 1 (CNA)
(By Lawrence Chu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>ROC Economic Affairs Minister Wang Chih-kang
on Tuesday unveiled six major policy directions to allow Taiwan's
economy to achieve better performance.</P>
      <P>Wang outlined the new policies at a morning presentation
delivered to the ruling Kuomintang's policy-making Central Standing
Committee meeting in Taipei.</P>
      <P>His report, entitled "Building A Competitive Advantage: Heading
towards Development of An Economic Peak," listed six major goals of
the government.</P>
      <P>These goals include creating a favorable investment environment,
improving basic infrastructure, developing technology-oriented
industries, strengthening and expanding the country's small- and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), strengthening the competitiveness of
exports and expanding international cooperation.</P>
      <P>Wang said measures to achieve the goals were urgently needed to
ensure that the country can retain its economic clout and that the
island's enterprises maintain their competitiveness amid growing
global competition.</P>
      <P>In the same report, Wang said that over the past few years,
Taiwan's economy has clearly emerged from the doldrums of recession
to take the lead among the four "Asian Dragon" countries in terms of
economic growth.</P>
      <P>Confidence among Taiwan's industrial executives has largely been
restored and private investment has vastly increased, providing a
driving force behind Taiwan's future economic growth, Wang added.</P>
      <P>He predicted that the country's annual economic growth rate will
exceed 6.58 percent by the end of the year, based on stable growth,
increased private investment and more active commercial and
industrial sectors.</P>
      <P>If such growth can be achieved, Taiwan will rank seventh in the
world in terms of economic growth, its highest position since 1992,
Wang said.</P>
      <P>However, despite his optimistic forecast, the minister warned
domestic industries that they will need to overcome many internal and
external environmental challenges in order to achieve a metamorphosis
that will enable them to face up to global competition.</P>
      <P>A highly efficient investment mechanism, a better investment
environment and a high level of investment standards will have to be
provided as part of this process.</P>
      <P>Wang described the achieving of an overall boost in production
competitiveness as an "important mission" in reforming the country's
economic system, adding that significant results will still depend
upon an increase in corporate investment, economic growth and
technological progress.</P>
      <P>He gave an assurance that his ministry will also work to help
industries create breakthroughs in production, innovations, actively
counsel SMEs to help them upgrade their production bases, encourage
firms to actively jump into international markets and capitalize on
Taiwan's economic strength to revitalize the global market.</P>
      <P>Wang said the new policy directions have been designed to meet
current domestic and international economic trends so that Taiwan's
economy can reach a new peak in performance.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CAL GIVEN ULTIMATUM TO PAY HIGHER INTEREST RATE FOR LEASED PLANES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.   1  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>ROC Minister of Transportation and
Communications Tsay Jaw-yang delivered an ultimatum to China Airlines
(CAL) on Wednesday that if it refuses to pay new interest rates for
planes leased by the company, the government will terminate its
contract with the former national carrier.</P>
      <P>Tsay's ultimatum came during a report to the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>In order to address a trade imbalance with the United States ten
years ago, the government purchased 10 long-haul planes, including
five 747-400s, one 747-200 and four MD-11s, subsequently leasing them
to CAL.</P>
      <P>CAL later bought three of the planes from the government, but
continues to rent the remaining seven, which are registered by the
Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) as being worth a total of
NT$21.45 billion (US$747.38 million). The interest rate was listed
at 3 percent, subject to review every three years during the
19-and-a-half year lease.</P>
      <P>The current rate was supposed to be 5.4375 percent until its
expiration on Oct. 22, 1998, but legislators in a previous session of
the legislature earlier this year decided to adjust the rate upwards
to 7.2 percent, starting from Oct. 4.</P>
      <P>The CAA is now asking CAL to pay the new rate or risk termination
of the lease contract. Sources said that if CAL contests the new rate,
the CAA will turn the issue over to arbitration or solve it through
legal means.</P>
      <P>CAL said that the old rate should remain until the 1998
expiration date, adding that the government should not adjust the
rate unilaterally. CAL also cited its good credit record, which
should entitle it to a low interest rate, so that it need not pay the
full 7.2 percent.</P>
      <P>Moreover, CAL complained that the only reason it leased the
planes in the first place was because it was following government
policy at that time.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Australian political scene is entering
a period of turbulence as the ruling coalition government under Prime
Minister John Howard is taking a tit-for-tat approach to the
opposition, which has so far brought down three ministers and three
prime ministerial office staff over a travel expenses scandal,
analysts said.</P>
      <P>Opposition Labor Party leader Kim Beazley, who was one of the
politicians who disclosed the scandal last week, will be drawn into a
travel expense scandal of his own on Wednesday over the involvement
of one of his personal staffers in a rental car scandal.</P>
      <P>Analysts said this is the beginning of a tit-for-tat battle being
waged by the Howard government to get even with the opposition, which
has successfully forced Howard to sack three ministers and three of
his personal staff.</P>
      <P>But they said Beazley will also have new ammunition to fire at
Veterans Affairs Minister Bruce Scott over his use of a
taxpayer-funded plane to visit friends four times in a single year.</P>
      <P>The two new issues guarantee that the so-called "travelgate"
scandal will continue to dominate the Australian parliament.</P>
      <P>Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock, who disclosed the false car
rental claims of Beazley's staffer, forced all MPs to stop and think
about where they are heading on the expenses scandal.</P>

      <P>Australia is offering to provide security

wake of the country's coup and subsequent political unrest.</P>
      <P>The Sydney Morning Herald on Wednesday reported Foreign Minister
Alexander Downer's plans to raise the security issue at a meeting in
New York with Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen.</P>
      <P>Because neither the Cambodian government nor the United Nations

Cambodia's elections in 1993, Australia has floated an alternative.</P>
      <P>The daily said it would be a far more modest exercise, bringing
together a coalition of countries which could include representatives
from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations as well as Australia,
Japan and the United States.</P>
      <P>The Cambodian government is highly sensitive to any foreign
involvement that could be seen as interference in its internal

    <HEADLINE>SHIPPING TYCOON PUBLISHES MEMOIRS TO MARK 70TH BIRTHDAY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  1  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The memoirs of Evergreen Group Chairman
Chang Jung-fa hit bookstores on Wednesday to mark the shipping
tycoon's 70th birthday on Oct. 6.</P>
      <P>In a preface to his autobiography, Chang mentions that many
people tend to describe him as a "mysterious" person. "In fact, I'm
not a bit mysterious, although I do adopt a low-profile way of life
and seldom provide my personal data to the outside world," the
self-made shipping baron noted.</P>
      <P>Chang said he has spent nearly 10 years preparing for the
publication of his memoirs because he wants to give the reading
public an honest, unexaggerated account of his life's journey.</P>
      <P>His memoirs recount his family background, school years, the
start of his career and the establishment of Evergreen Marine Corp.,
which currently operates the world's largest container shipping
fleet.</P>
      <P>Chang said he hopes the story of his struggle from scratch to
achieve fame in the shipping world will provide some inspiration to
today's youth who are striving to build up their own careers or
business ventures.</P>
      <P>Chang's first venture -- Evergreen Marine Corp. -- was launched
in 1968 and has since managed to expand into a number of lines of
business. Today, the Evergreen Group has emerged as a multinational
business conglomerate with interests in many different areas.</P>
      <P>In addition to shipping services, the group also controls EVA
Airways, the first completely private Taiwan airline to operate
international flights, and a variety of companies in manufacturing,
construction, financial services and other industries.</P>
      <P>"Although some people describe Evergreen's development from an
obscure firm to one of the world's largest shipping corporations in a
rather short period of time as a `miracle,' I fully understand that
there is not a bit of `luck' in its success," Chang wrote.
"Evergreen's success lies in the wholehearted devotion of me and my
colleagues. Other people can never understand how much time, sweat,
blood and money we have contributed to our ventures."</P>
      <P>Chang recounted the way other shipping companies had tried to
boycott Evergreen when it opened its new shipping routes, as well as
the many stumbling blocks which he had to overcome in his struggle to
establish EVA Airways.</P>
      <P>Chang depicts himself as a "son of the sea." Born and raised in
Suao, a small fishing port on Taiwan's northeastern coast, he then
lived in the northern Taiwan port city of Keelung for 40 years. His
father and elder brothers were all engaged in the marine transport
business and he himself started work in a shipping company while
still in high school. He later qualified as a navigation technician
and began his own shipping company after serving as a sailor for 15
years.</P>
      <P>Chang said he has always maintained his belief in the goodness of
humanity, adding that a thankful heart and a willingness to repay
dues are the most important assets to allow one to lead a happy and
meaningful life.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DEPRESSION MAY CONTRIBUTE TO NICOTINE WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York, Sept. 30 (CNA)
(By David Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Though it generally is true that giving
up smoking is more difficult for those who smoke more cigarettes or
have smoked longer, investigators at the Washington University School
of Medicine in St. Louis have found that psychiatric illnesses also
may contribute to severe withdrawal symptoms, making it even harder
for those smokers to stop.</P>
      <P>The investigators questioned more than 550 women to learn their
smoking histories, determine their history of nicotine dependence and
catalogue their nicotine withdrawal symptoms.</P>
      <P>This study was reported in a recent issue of the journal
Addition.</P>
      <P>"I was interested in whether there were different profiles of
nicotine withdrawal symptoms, and if so, whether certain combinations
of symptoms might be more likely to occur in smokers with a history
of psychiatric disorder," said Pamela Madden, Ph.D., research
instructor of psychiatry at Washington University, who co-headed the
study. "The literature suggests an association between nicotine
dependence, nicotine withdrawal and a history of major depression --
a psychiatric disorder that is more prevalent in women."</P>
      <P>Madden found that most women in the study experienced one of
three levels of nicotine withdrawal: mild, moderate or severe. About
41 percent of smokers suffered mild withdrawal from nicotine, with
most experiencing only a few symptoms. Another 36 percent were rated
as having moderate withdrawal symptoms. The severe group included
about 18 percent of smokers in the study.</P>
      <P>Madden plans further analysis of this data to look more closely
at genetic and personality factor involved in nicotine withdrawal.
All women surveyed in the study were twins, so she hopes to look at
whether symptoms of nicotine withdrawal and other indicators of
nicotine dependence run in families. Ultimately, she'd like to use
data from the women in her studies and compare them to men to learn
about gender differences and their impact on nicotine dependence and
withdrawal.</P>

      <P>High-tech products again showed
their increasing strength in the US economy, as San Jose, the capital
of Silicon Valley, became the top exporter of US products in 1996.</P>
      <P>According to a Commerce Department study, San Jose exported
US$29.3 billion worth of goods in 1996, overcoming New York's US$28
billion and Detroit's US$27.5 billion. Detroit enjoyed the top spot
in 1994 and 1995.</P>
      <P>The figures underscore Silicon Valley's crucial role in vast
global trading networks. Many local companies, including giants such

overseas.</P>
      <P>The Commerce Department statistics include only manufactured
goods. They don't include products such as software, which is still
classified as service. If included, software exports would

    <DATELINE>Los  Angeles,  Sept.  30 (CNA)
(By Philip Liu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Los Angeles Times said Tuesday
that Beijing continues to make good on its promise to eliminate
democratic measures that the British instituted in Hong Kong in 1995,
and that the May 1998 election of the Hong Kong legislature may mark
the end of the touted "one country, two systems" policy.</P>
      <P>In an editorial on Tuesday, the daily noted, "Members of Hong
Kong's new provisional legislature, all appointed with Beijing's
blessing, have approved plans to sharply cut back the number of
eligible voters in the first election under Chinese rule, set for
next May."</P>
      <P>It called the rollback "expected but nevertheless disappointing."</P>
      <P>"In the 1995 election, under British rule, 2.7 million residents
were able to vote. According to the new rules, Hong Kong will use a
complex proportional representation system to prevent any one party
from dominating the 60-seat legislature. Under Beijing's scheme, 20
seats will be filled at large by all voters and 30 seats will go to
business representatives elected by a smaller number, 180,000 people.
The remaining 10 seats will be filled by an 800-member electoral
committee of pro-Beijing and business interests," the daily noted.</P>
      <P>"The new electoral rules make clear that Beijing intends to make
its influence felt in the legislature, both in numbers and policies.
None of the changes offer fresh air for democracy. The May elections
will be watched closely, for they may mark the end of the touted 'one
China, two system' policy," the daily said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INITIAL INVESTIGATION SHOWS HUMAN ERROR TO BLAME FOR F-5 CRASH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  1  (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A high-ranking air force official said on
Wednesday that a preliminary investigation showed that human error
might to be blame for the crash of two F-5 series jet fighters on
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"The pilots are believed to have misjudged the altitude at which
they were flying before their jets crashed into a mountainside in the
eastern county of Hualien," Hsu Chai-chung, chief-of-staff of the Air
Force Headquarters, said at the Legislative Yuan while answering
questions from lawmakers.</P>
      <P>His statement excluded the possibility that the F-5E and the
twin-seater F-5F might have collided with each other during a flight
back to their air base in Hualien following a routine training
mission.</P>
      <P>Hsu said the investigation has found that the two military
fighters maintained the required distance while flying side-by-side
and that judging from the way the treetops had been sheared off at
the crash site, the pilots might have made deadly errors in judging
altitude in conditions of poor visibility.</P>
      <P>Defense Minister Chiang Chung-ling said that earlier remarks made
by him on Tuesday that the two jets had collided was based on initial
investigation results, adding that "the real cause of the accident is
still under investigation."</P>
      <P>Legislator Wang Tien-ching of ruling Kuomintang commented that
the air force has a rather high accident rate, proven by the fact
that eight military planes have crashed since November 1995, claiming
the lives of 13 air force personnel.</P>
      <P>Chiang demurred, however, indicating that the ROC air force
accident rate of 2,8 cases per 100,000 flying hours compared
favorably with the US's 6.5 cases and France's 6.2 cases.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WEINBERGER URGES WASHINGTON TO REJECT "ONE COUNTRY, TWO SYSTEMS"</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  Sept.  30  (CNA)
(By Jane-jane Huang and Lawrence Chu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former US Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger has urged Washington to reject Beijing's proposal to apply
its "one country, two systems" unification model toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Weinberger, whose views were published in an opinion column
appearing in the latest edition of Forbes magazine, said Washington
should not fall into what he called a Communist Chinese trap by
sanctioning Beijing's plans to engineer Taiwan's unification with
the mainland under the "one country, two systems" formula.</P>
      <P>The scheme was devised by former mainland Chinese paramount leader
Deng Xiaoping and provided the framework for Hong Kong's transition
after the former British colony's July 1997 handover to Beijing.</P>
      <P>Under the policy, Hong Kong is allowed to retain its free-market
economy and capitalist lifestyle for 50 years and is promised a "high
degree of autonomy" with minimum interference from the socialist
mainland.</P>
      <P>Since the handover, Beijing has launched a propaganda campaign
aimed at seeking Taiwan's consent to unify with the mainland under
the same system.</P>
      <P>However, in his commentary, Weinberger said Taiwan's situation
was completely different from that of Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>He said the 21 million people on Taiwan not only had selected
their head of state in direct, democratic elections, but also had
complete freedom of choice in their form of government and had long
enjoyed freedoms of speech and religion.</P>
      <P>As a fully democratic country, Taiwan has absolutely nothing in
common with the communist regime, he said.</P>
      <P>Weinberger noted that Tung Chee-hwa, the chief executive of the
newly established "Special Administrative Region" of Hong Kong, had
repeatedly asserted during his recent visit to the United States that
Hong Kong's economy has continued to grow since the handover and that
he had painted a rosy picture of the territory under Communist
Chinese rule.</P>
      <P>Tung also said that as long as the American government is
confident in the success of the "one country, two systems" framework
in Hong Kong, Taiwan would have no reason to continue resisting
unification under the same formula.</P>
      <P>Weinberger, who oversaw US defense policy in the administration
of former President Ronald Reagan, said Beijing's unrelenting
pressure on the issue had clearly won a degree of support within
President Bill Clinton's administration.</P>
      <P>He expressed concern that Clinton might be swayed by these
opinions in the hope of improving relations with Beijing or for
similar reasons, warning that this could result in a major mistake
that would be hard to reverse.</P>
      <P>Weinberger said Washington's relations with Taipei are defined by
the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, under which the United States is
committed to provide Taiwan with adequate defensive weapons and
services needed to maintain the island's self-defense capability.</P>
      <P>It also seeks to ensure that only peaceful means will be used in
deciding Taiwan's future.</P>
      <P>Weinberger said the United States must be highly concerned over
any potential threats to the stability of the Western Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Weinberger, who has visited Taiwan several times since stepping
down as defense secretary, also discussed Washington's dispatch of
two aircraft carrier groups to the Taiwan area in March 1996, when
Beijing conducted a series of menacing military exercises and missile
tests in waters off the island's coast.</P>
      <P>He said that if America had failed to take such action, Communist
China would have interpreted it as a sign that Washington had
conceded to Beijing's effective sovereignty over Taiwan.</P>
      <P>This in turn could have prompted a bloody war between America and
Communist China, he said.</P>
      <P>He said that World War II had erupted primarily because Nazi
Germany's dictator Adolf Hitler thought no country would stand up to
his aggression. And the Korean War had broken out in part because
then US Secretary of State Dean Acheson had stated in a policy speech
that the Korean Peninsula was outside the American defense perimeter,
which indirectly encouraged North Korea to launch an attack on the
South. Weinberger warned Americans not to tolerate aggressive actions
against Taiwan by simply thinking that "Taiwan is just another Hong
Kong."</P>
      <P>If Communist China is made aware of America's resolve to prevent
threats to Taiwan's security, the island will be less likely to fall
victim to a military attack from the mainland, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US HOUSE PANEL FAVORS THEATER MISSLE DEFENSE SYSTEM FOR TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Sept. 30 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The International Relations Committee
of the US House of Representatives approved on Tuesday a bill that
would require the secretary of defense to report to Congress on how
the United States would help Taiwan develop a theater ballistic
missile defense system against missile attacks from mainland China.</P>
      <P>The bill, approved by a voice vote, says that no later than July
1, 1998, the secretary of defense shall submit a report to Congress
to describe how the United States would provide Taiwan with an
advanced missile defense system.</P>
      <P>The bill also expresses the sense of Congress that the US
president, if requested by the Taipei government, should transfer
appropriate defense articles to Taiwan for the purpose of
establishing a local-area ballistic missile defense system to protect
Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, and the offshore islands of Kinmen and
Matsu.</P>
      <P>"The Congress declares that it is in the national interest of the
United States that Taiwan be included in any effort at ballistic
missile defense cooperation, networking, or interoperability with
friendly and allied nations in the Asia-Pacific region," it says.</P>
      <P>Prior to passing the measure, the committee adopted an amendment
introduced by Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.), adding a new
provision in the bill. The provision expresses the sense of Congress
that the president should state openly that the American people have
a "firm commitment" to the security and democracy of the people of
Taiwan. He should also reiterate that issues between the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait should be resolved by peaceful means.</P>
      <P>The committee also adopted a motion by Rep. Donald Manzullo
(R-Ill.) to delete a provision that would amend the Taiwan Relations
Act. The provision called for a new subsection in Section 3 of the
Taiwan Relations Act, stating that the subsections (a) and (b)
regarding US arms sales to Taiwan "supersede" any contrary provision
of the Aug. 17, 1982, joint communique between Washington and
Beijing.</P>
      <P>Testifying at the markup meeting, Susan Shirk, deputy assistant
secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, insisted that
the Taiwan Relations Act and the three joint communiques between the
United States and mainland China are consistent.</P>
      <P>While acknowledging that the Taiwan Relations Act, a US law,
takes precedence over any policy statements such as the communiques,
Shirk said these documents together have formed the foundation of US
policy toward mainland China and Taiwan and have helped to maintain
peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait area for a long time.</P>
      <P>Shirk warned that the provision could disrupt the foundation of
the US relationship with Beijing. She also said the Clinton
administration opposed the "United States-Taiwan Anti-Ballistic
Missile Defense Cooperation Act" because Beijing might view it as the
United States viewing mainland China as an enemy.</P>
      <P>In her view, the effect of this legislation could cause
disruption in the administration's plans for the forthcoming summit
between President Bill Clinton and Communist Chinese leader Jiang
Zemin.</P>
      <P>However, Rep. Rohrabacher disagreed, saying that as Jiang is
coming to the United States for his first official visit, it is
important for the United States to restate clearly the prerequisites
for the US relationship with mainland China, so that Beijing will not
have a false impression of the US positions.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  1  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China welcomes any move
that will contribute to peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific
region, Vice Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs John Chang said
on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chang was responding to the passage of a bill by the
International Relations Committee of the US House of Representatives
calling for US-Taiwan cooperation in establishing a theater ballistic
missile defense system.</P>
      <P>Chang said the bill mainly reflects congressional views and will
not necessarily form a part of US policy, adding that the attitude of
the US executive branch is critical to determining whether or not
Taiwan will be included within the US-proposed Asia-Pacific regional
anti-ballistic missile defense system.</P>
      <P>Chang said the proposal to include Taiwan within such a system,
also known as a theater missile defense system (TMD), has been
brought up by many American lawmakers and academics.</P>
      <P>In fact, Vice President Lien Chan said earlier this year that
mainland China's missile tests and war games in waters near Taiwan
between mid-1995 and March 1996 have prompted the United States and
the international community to pay much more attention to
Asia-Pacific regional peace and stability. Against this backdrop, the
proposal to develop a costly TMD system is once again under serious
consideration.</P>
      <P>Chang said he cannot comment on the newly passed US congressional
bill before he has fully analyzed its content. "But we welcome any
proposal or action that will contribute to Asia-Pacific regional
peace and stability."</P>
      <P>According to reports from Washington, the International Relations
Committee of the US House of Representatives approved a bill by a

a theater ballistic missile defense system against missile attacks
from mainland China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US HOUSE PANEL FAVORS THEATER MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM FOR TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Sept. 30 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The International Relations Committee
of the US House of Representatives approved on Tuesday a bill that
would require the secretary of defense to report to Congress on how
the United States would help Taiwan develop a theater ballistic
missile defense system against missile attacks from mainland China.</P>
      <P>The bill, approved by a voice vote, says that no later than July
1, 1998, the secretary of defense shall submit a report to Congress
to describe how the United States would provide Taiwan with an
advanced missile defense system.</P>
      <P>The bill also expresses the sense of Congress that the US
president, if requested by the Taipei government, should transfer
appropriate defense articles to Taiwan for the purpose of
establishing a local-area ballistic missile defense system to protect
Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, and the offshore islands of Kinmen and
Matsu.</P>
      <P>"The Congress declares that it is in the national interest of the
United States that Taiwan be included in any effort at ballistic
missile defense cooperation, networking, or interoperability with
friendly and allied nations in the Asia-Pacific region," it says.</P>
      <P>Prior to passing the measure, the committee adopted an amendment
introduced by Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.), adding a new
provision in the bill. The provision expresses the sense of Congress
that the president should state openly that the American people have
a "firm commitment" to the security and democracy of the people of
Taiwan. He should also reiterate that issues between the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait should be resolved by peaceful means.</P>
      <P>The committee also adopted a motion by Rep. Donald Manzullo
(R-Ill.) to delete a provision that would amend the Taiwan Relations
Act. The provision called for a new subsection in Section 3 of the
Taiwan Relations Act, stating that the subsections (a) and (b)
regarding US arms sales to Taiwan "supersede" any contrary provision
of the Aug. 17, 1982, joint communique between Washington and
Beijing.</P>
      <P>Testifying at the markup meeting, Susan Shirk, deputy assistant
secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, insisted that
the Taiwan Relations Act and the three joint communiques between the
United States and mainland China are consistent.</P>
      <P>While acknowledging that the Taiwan Relations Act, a US law,
takes precedence over any policy statements such as the communiques,
Shirk said these documents together have formed the foundation of US
policy toward mainland China and Taiwan and have helped to maintain
peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait area for a long time.</P>
      <P>Shirk warned that the provision could disrupt the foundation of
the US relationship with Beijing. She also said the Clinton
administration opposed the "United States-Taiwan Anti-Ballistic
Missile Defense Cooperation Act" because Beijing might view it as the
United States viewing mainland China as an enemy.</P>
      <P>In her view, the effect of this legislation could cause
disruption in the administration's plans for the forthcoming summit
between President Bill Clinton and Communist Chinese leader Jiang
Zemin.</P>
      <P>However, Rep. Rohrabacher disagreed, saying that as Jiang is
coming to the United States for his first official visit, it is
important for the United States to restate clearly the prerequisites
for the US relationship with mainland China, so that Beijing will not
have a false impression of the US positions.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CSBC SAYS IT CAN BUILD SUBMARINES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  1  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The state-owned China Shipbuilding Corp.
(CSBC) said Wednesday that it has beefed up its ability to build and
maintain ships, and is confident that it is capable of building
submarines.</P>
      <P>The CSBC was responding to earlier reports that the Navy is
planning to work with the CSBC to build submarines.</P>
      <P>The CSBC said however that the Navy has not contacted it over the
matter. But, should the navy decide to build submarines after
repeated setbacks in attempts to purchase them from major
arms-supplying countries, the CSBC said it has sufficient experience
in shipbuilding and maintenance to construct the underwater vessels,
so long as it can obtain design blueprints and related technology.</P>
      <P>In the 1980s, Taiwan successfully developed the Indigenous
Defense Fighter aircraft with the help of some foreign components,
and the Navy is reportedly considering the same approach to produce
submarines.</P>
      <P>Taiwan currently operates two Dutch-built Swordfish submarines,
and the CSBC has actively sought assistance for their upkeep, hoping
to gain some know-how for building and maintaining its own
submarines.</P>
      <P>The CSBC has close links with the Navy, which has already
commissioned the CSBC to build seven Cheng Kung-class frigates
patterned after the US-developed Perry-class frigates.</P>
      <P>The CSBC also assists in the maintenance and repair of the Navy's
Knox-class frigates leased from the United States and the
Lafayette-class missile frigates purchased from France.</P>
      <P>The CSBC said the basic principles behind the construction of all
warships are essentially the same and, although submarines are more
sophisticated than surface vessels, it should be able to overcome
most of the difficulties in building an indigenous submarine so long
as the necessary design blueprints and technical assistance can be
obtained.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO MARK ELDERS DAY  (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 1 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In slightly over a week's time, the Republic
of China on Taiwan will celebrate Elders Day, an occasion set aside
by the nation to pay homage to its senior citizens.</P>
      <P>For ancestor-worshipping Chinese, the day which falls on the
ninth day of the ninth month on the lunar calendar is a time for
people to display their filial piety and to educate the youth to
respect their seniors. Elders Day this year comes on Oct. 10, the ROC
National Day.</P>
      <P>To mark the special day, a series of activities, including
parties, ball games, and seminars on welfare for the aged will be
held in counties and cities throughout the Taiwan area. People over
70 years of age will also be given red envelops containing cash and
other gifts to observe the occasion.</P>
      <P>In Taipei City, two centenarians have been invited to join in
some celebratory programs where they will receive special citations
and gifts. The two, Ms. Huang Lien-mei, 114, and Ms. Hsi Shenholien,
113, are the oldest citizens in Taipei and probably in all Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ms. Huang has two sons, one daughter, 12 grandchildren and more
than a dozen great-grandchildren. She lives with one of her
grandchildren and enjoys chatting with people. Ms. Hsi has stayed in
a home for the elderly following the death of her son three years
ago. She is shy with reporters but not with people who come bearing
gifts. She likes to eat the coconut candies brought by her
daughter-in-law on frequent visits.</P>
      <P>With the improvement of living standards and better health care,
the life span for people in Taiwan has been steadily increasing
during the past decades. Recently released statistics show that the
life span in Taiwan stands at 74.5 years, 71.81 years for men and
77.76 for women. The figure, although lower compared with the 79
years for the Japanese, is among the highest in Asia. (more)</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO MARK ELDERS DAY (II)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 1 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A nation is considered an aged society when more than 7 percent
of its people are 65 years old or over, according to the criteria set
by the United Nations. Taiwan became an aged society in 1993 when
official statistics indicated that 7.1 percent of its population was
over 65.</P>
      <P>Researchers at the Council for Economic Planning and Development
(CEPD) said that the aging of the population in Taiwan has occurred
faster than in many other countries due to a drastic fall in birth
rates following the post-World War II baby boom. Persons born in 1945
will turn 65 in the year 2010. By 2050, senior citizens will make up
16.5 percent of Taiwan's population, they predicted.</P>
      <P>At present, one in every nine persons in Taiwan is over 65, but
by 2025, the ratio will be one in every five persons. The increased
percentage of elderly people will undoubtedly present burdens on
those members of society who support them. This means that while each
citizen over 65 is currently being supported by eight younger
persons, in 30 years' time, only four persons will be supporting the
seniors. Therefore, younger people in the 21st century will face
heavier financial burdens, the researchers pointed out.</P>
      <P>As the nation's average life span steadily increases, the number
of centenarians in Taiwan also grows. In 1992, there were only 291
persons aged 100 years or older, but the figure rose to 497 in 1994,
and 583 in 1996. The CEPD estimates that the number of centenarians
islandwide will reach 818 by the turn of the century, 2,911 by the
year 2020 and 5,335 by 2030.</P>
      <P>The rapid increase in the number of senior citizens has already
posed serious problems for both the government and the public. As
people grow older, they need more financial assistance from the
government and also require more and often costly medical services
for longer periods of time. To meet these costs, the government has
to raise tax revenues from younger people in the workforce.</P>
      <P>Experts in social welfare and family planning programs have
called on the government and the public to work together in finding
ways to resolve the problems caused by the graying society. Their
suggestions include the establishment of a compulsory savings system
for working people when they are young, improvement of medical
insurance programs for the elderly, and an efficient pension system.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Defense Minister Chiang Chung-ling said
Wednesday that Taiwan welcomes a proposal by a committee of US House
of Representatives that Taiwan be included in a theater missile
defense (TMD) system.</P>
      <P>Chiang was responding to the passage of a bill Tuesday by the
Committee on International Relations, which called for the United
States to help Taiwan establish a local-area ballistic missile
defense system to protect the island from missile attacks.</P>
      <P>Chiang said that Taiwan appreciates the US congressmen's good
intentions, but whether it will take part in the missile defense
system needs further study.</P>
      <P>Chiang said that the research and development of the US-initiated
TMD system is still at the initial stages, adding that the huge cost
of the missile defense system will be shared by the countries
covered.</P>
      <P>The Defense Ministry will assess whether the TMD system can
effectively protect the countries involved from outside missile
attacks and determine whether the national defense budget can support
Taiwan's participation in the system, Chiang said at the Legislative
Yuan while answering questions from lawmakers.</P>
      <P>The defense officials said that the TMD system is derived from
the "Star Wars" defense initiative by the US Reagan administration in
the 1980s, with its magnitude reduced to a regional scope. The
initial research fund is estimated at US$9 billion, currently shared
by the US and Japan.</P>
      <P>The officials said that the TMD system is expected to reach the
first-stage completion by the year 2003, with the total research and
development fund amounting to over US$20 billion.</P>

      <P>The Republic of China and Austria on
Wednesday signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on economic and
technical cooperation.</P>
      <P>ROC Vice Economic Affairs Minister Lin Yi-fu and his Austrian
counterpart Josef Mayer, signed the MOU on behalf of their respective
governments.</P>
      <P>Mayer earlier called on ROC Economics Minister Wang Chih-kang and
was briefed by economics officials on Taiwan's trade and economic
situation. The two ministers also discussed the development of
bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>Wang indicated that Austria is keen to participate in Taiwan's
environmental protection efforts, including the development of
incinerators, as well as large-scale petrochemical and aviation
industry projects. He said the signing of the MOU will help establish
a pattern for technological cooperation and will promote trade and
information exchanges.</P>
      <P>Austria's economics minister, Hannes Farleiter, is scheduled to
visit Taiwan soon, following the steps of German Economics Minister
Gunter Rexrodt, who arrived here last week.</P>
      <P>Bilateral trade between Taiwan and Austria totaled US$540 million
last year, with Taiwan exporting US$310 million in goods and services

      <P>Taiwan is Austria's third largest trading partner in Asia. Taiwan
business activities in Austria are mostly concentrated in the areas
of computer and telecommunications equipment.</P>
      <P>Economic officials said Austria, located in a strategic position
in central Europe, has close relations with both Eastern and Western

    <TEXT>
      <P>President of the Republic of Chad Idriss
Deby will pay a visit to Taiwan from Oct. 15 to 19, the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs announced Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The African country resumed the diplomatic relations with the
Republic of China on August 12 after a 25-year hiatus. Deby, who won
Chad's first post-independence presidential election in July 1996 and
formed a government in May 1997, will visit Taiwan for the first time
at the invitation of President Lee Teng-hui.</P>
      <P>President Lee will welcome Deby with a military ceremony at the
Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall in downtown Taipei. Lee and Deby will
then hold talks on issues of mutual concern between their countries.</P>
      <P>In addition, Deby will visit Economics Ministry and the
cabinet-level the Council of Agriculture, meet with local business
leaders and visit the World Trade Center to gain a better
understanding of the economic and cultural development of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Located in central Africa, Chad has a population of about seven
million on a land area of 1.28 million square kilometers. Taiwan was
Chad's fifth largest importer in 1996, with the import value worth
over US$4 million. The leading import item into Taiwan from Chad was
cotton.</P>
      <P>The ROC established diplomatic ties with Chad in January 1962,
but severed those links on Dec. 27 1972, one month after Chad signed
a communique recognizing the government in Beijing. The two countries
restored diplomatic relations when Chad Foreign Minister Mahamat
Saleh Annadif visited Taipei in August and signed a communique of
mutual recognition with ROC Foreign Minister John Chang.</P>

    <DATELINE>Hong  Kong,  Oct.  2 (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu &amp; Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>It is ironic that millions of refugees
who fled to Hong Kong to escape Communist Chinese rule are now seeing
the mainland's five-star flag hoisted everywhere in celebration of
national day, observed an editorial in Hong Kong's Oriental Daily
News on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The editorial pointed out that many people in Hong Kong have
little confidence in the People's Republic of China (PRC) due to
Beijing's steadfast adherence to communism. It said that the red flag
is a totem of all the hardships and bitterness suffered by the
Chinese people in recent decades.</P>
      <P>After adopting free-market reforms and an open door policy in
1979, Beijing has made genuine progress in upgrading people's
material living standards as well as their spiritual lives. But the
most important thing for the leadership in Beijing, said the
editorial, is to learn the lessons of the past and never repeat those
mistakes.</P>
      <P>While wishing Beijing well in its efforts to firmly establish the
rule of law and to crack down on corruption, the Oriental Daily
urged the communist authorities to be more "open-minded" and to
release imprisoned pro-democracy dissidents at an early date.</P>

    <DATELINE>New  York,  Oct.  1  (CNA)
(By K.C. Huang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The vice premier of Belize, Dean O.
Barrow, on Wednesday criticized the United Nations for excluding the
Republic of China, saying the policy is irrational and unenlightened.</P>
      <P>Barrow, who concurrently serves as the Central American country's
minister of foreign affairs, took advantage during his address at the
UN General Assembly debate to lend support for the ROC's bid to
rejoin the world body.</P>
      <P>Living in a successful, robust and prosperous democracy, Barrow
said, the 21 million people of Taiwan should be entitled at the very
least to a discussion of their circumstances.</P>
      <P>"The blanket `no,' the annual ritual that continues to slam the
door shut on even the possibility of debating their aspirations, is
irrational and unenlightened," Barrow asserted, adding that a way
must be found to review the situation in a manner consistent with the
rights of the parties and the spirit of the UN Charter.</P>
      <P>The foreign ministers of two other ROC diplomatic allies --
Malawi and Haiti -- also spoke on the same occasion, but neither
touched on the issue of the ROC's UN membership.</P>
      <P>Although the prepared text of Malawi Foreign Minister Mapopa
Chipeta contained a paragraph supporting the ROC's bid to join
international organizations and activities, Chipeta skipped the
paragraph while addressing the General Assembly debate session.</P>
      <P>The ROC lost its seat in the United Nations in 1971 when the
world body accepted the communist government in Beijing as the sole
representative of the Chinese people.</P>
      <P>The UN General Assembly's steering committee on Sept. 17 rejected
for a fifth straight year a request to consider the question of ROC
representation. This year's petition, signed by 14 of Taipei's
diplomatic allies, called for the re-examination of Resolution No.
2758, which expelled the ROC in 1971 to make way for mainland China.</P>
      <P>In addition to Belize, nine other UN members -- Nicaragua, Fiji,
Paraguay, El Salvador, Honduras, the Dominican Republic, Saint
Christopher and Nevis, Swaziland and Burkina Faso --have also voiced
support for the ROC's UN bid since the current General Assembly
debate session started on Sept. 22.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COMPULSORY SAVINGS MAY HELP PREVENT ABSCONDING: HSU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  2  (CNA)
(By Debbie Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Compulsory savings can be an effective
measure to prevent irregularities such as absconding on the part of
foreign laborers working in Taiwan, Taiwan's top labor affairs
official said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Hsu Chieh-kwei, chairman of the cabinet-level Council of Labor
Affairs (CLA), said he reached a consensus with labor affairs
ministers from Thailand and the Philippines during a recent APEC
meeting in Seoul on a plan to require Filipino and Thai workers in
Taiwan to put part of their earnings in savings as part of a scheme
to dissuade them from fleeing their jobs.</P>
      <P>According to a preliminary CLA plan, Thai and Filipino workers
will be asked to deposit one-third of their monthly salaries in time
savings accounts which cannot be drawn upon during their stay in
Taiwan. The savings will be mailed overseas to the workers' hometowns
only after they legally terminate their Taiwan employment, he noted.</P>
      <P>Thailand and the Philippines are the main sources of foreign
laborers in Taiwan, most of whom work in labor-intensive sectors,
such as manufacturing and construction, and as household helpers.</P>
      <P>The measure, which must be drafted and then passed by the
legislature, will be the first of its kind in the world if put into
force, Hsu noted.</P>
      <P>Actually, several Taiwan manufacturing companies already require
their foreign laborers to save part of their monthly earnings as a
"safety measure" to not only help the workers save money for their
own benefit but also to prevent them from easily absconding, Hsu
pointed out.</P>
      <P>He said that any company which adopts the practice should open
the time savings accounts under the alien workers' individual names
rather than under the company's name. Troubles may arise if a
manufacturing company closes down and its alien workers' savings
accounts are held in the company's name, Hsu noted.</P>

materials -- at the Milan trade fair between Sept. 28 and Sept. 30.
More than 400 buyers showed up in search of their favorite fabrics.</P>
      <P>Italy was Taiwan's fourth largest source of textile products last
year, supplying 7 percent of the total value of the island's imports
in this sector, according to TTF statistics.</P>
      <P>Over the past few years, the major items of Taiwan's textile
exports have shifted from garments to cloth materials, which
accounted for 59 percent of Taiwan's entire textile exports in 1996,
with an accumulated export value of US$9.1 billion, the TTF spokesman
indicated.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan's textile industry has been facing strong
competition from mainland China, which enjoys cheap labor and
low-cost resources. As a result, most textile enterprises on the
island have been forced to upgrade or shift their current development
strategies from making low-cost garments to producing high-quality,
diverse and delicate items.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said that with his federation's assistance and the
efforts of local textile-makers in upgrading the industry, which
includes forging overseas alliances, Taiwan's textile sector is
enjoying success in opening new markets, especially those in Europe
where several international fashion centers are located.</P>
      <P>Last year, Taiwan's textile exports were valued at US$15.5
billion, which accounted for 14 percent of the total export volume,
the TTF statistics showed. That performance placed the textile
industry as the second largest in Taiwan, following the information
sector.</P>
      <P>The TTF is a key organization in Taiwan for the regulation of
textile quotas, promotion of textile exports, marketing research and
providing relevant information.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SIEW CALLS FOR RESUMPTION OF CROSS-STRAIT TALKS WITHOUT CONDITIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 2 (CNA)
(By Debbie Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew on Thursday once again
welcomed mainland Chinese leaders' recent calls for opening of
political negotiations across the Taiwan Strait as "positive"
responses to Taiwan's overtures.</P>
      <P>Siew, however, reiterated Taipei's hope that the two sides
unconditionally resume the high-level talks initiated in 1993, better
known as the "Koo-Wang talks" in reference to the officials from the
two sides who chaired those discussions.</P>
      <P>It was the second time in three days that Siew had made similar
statements, following calls by mainland Chinese Premier Li Peng and
by Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen on Sept. 29 for
Taipei to consult with Beijing on procedural arrangements for
cross-strait political negotiations.</P>
      <P>Siew reiterated Taipei's position that the two sides can begin
preparatory discussions on cross-strait political issues by resuming
the Koo-Wang talks.</P>
      <P>Taipei has repeatedly called for the resumption of cross-strait
talks during the past two years after Beijing unilaterally suspended
bilateral dialogue in June 1995 in the wake of President Lee
Teng-hui's landmark visit to the United States, Siew noted.</P>
      <P>Siew again stressed that the unification of China under the
principles of democracy, freedom and the equitable distribution of
wealth is the ultimate goal of the ROC's mainland policy.</P>
      <P>He said the ROC government not only undertakes to protect the
security and well-being of the 21.6 million people living in Taiwan,
but also wants to help raise the standards of living of the 1.2
billion fellow countrymen on the mainland.</P>
      <P>To reach that goal, he said, Taipei has long promoted
cross-strait exchanges and sought pragmatic means of dialogue, in the
hope that "sincerity" and "goodwill" will help accelerate the
improvement of relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>

(By Debbie Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Dutch ABN AMRO Bank will begin issuing
credit cards in Taiwan in mid-October, hoping to take the advantage
of the booming domestic plastic-money market.</P>
      <P>According to Maarten Reuchlin, senior executive vice president of
ABN AMRO Bank's global consumer banking business, ABN AMRO chose
Taiwan over Singapore and Hong Kong for the maiden issuance of credit
cards in Asia because of Taiwan's larger population and
less-competitive market.</P>
      <P>Although fast-growing, Taiwan's credit card market still offers
room for ABN AMRO's presence, Reuchlin noted. By comparison,
Singapore and Hong Kong, both saturated and fiercely competitive,
offer little chances for newcomers, he added.</P>
      <P>Beginning on Oct. 15, said Paul Scholten, general manager of ABN
AMRO Bank in Taiwan, the bank will make available ABN AMRO Cards for
ordinary consumers, "Tulip Cards" for women clients, and "Business
Cards" for businessmen who frequently travel overseas.</P>
      <P>Using Taiwan as a testing gateway, ABN AMRO will aim at making
inroads into other Asian markets, including Indonesia, Thailand,
Malaysia, India, Hong Kong and the Philippines, Scholten said.</P>
      <P>ABN AMRO Bank is the largest bank in the Netherlands and the
eighth largest in the world in terms of capitalization. The bank,

    <HEADLINE>JIANG TALKS ABOUT QIAO SHI'S RETIREMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  Oct.  2  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>It seems that mainland China's President
Jiang Zemin is quite sensitive to the opinions of the outside world
concerning Qiao Shi's retirement.</P>
      <P>As chairman of the Standing Committee of the 8th National
People's Congress, Qiao's removal from the Politburo Standing
Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), aroused much
speculation. Qiao has long been seen as Jiang's political enemy.</P>
      <P>During a meeting with former Japanese Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita in Beijing on Wednesday, Jiang explained that Qiao's
stepping down was due solely to his advanced age.</P>
      <P>Those accompanying Takeshita in the meeting disclosed to the
Japanese media that, according to Jiang's explanation, under new
stipulation regarding the counting of age, persons born after the
month of June can be counted as being born in the following year.</P>
      <P>Thus, born in August 1926, Jiang was considered to be 70 years
old rather than 71 when the 15th National Congress of the CCP
convened this September. Hence, he was not deemed to have exceeded
the 70-year-old age limitation for the forced retirement of
officials, a rule adopted by the CCP.</P>
      <P>While Qiao Shi, born in December 1924, could also take advantage
of being considered one year younger, he had clearly surpassed the
retirement age, and thus there was no question regarding his stepping
down.</P>
      <P>According to the Japanese media reports, Jiang emphasized that
although Qiao's retirement had given rise to much criticism, the move
was part of a natural process of rejuvenation.</P>
      <P>Under this process, Jiang added, the 15th Party Congress had
replaced one-half of its Central Committee members and one-third of
its Politburo members.</P>
      <P>Qiao Shi will hand over his post as chairman of the standing
committee of the National People's Congress next March, which will
be filled by Premier Li Peng. Current Vice Premier Zhu Rongji is
expected to succeed Li in the premiership.</P>
      <P>Takeshita is attending activities marking the 25th anniversary of

    <HEADLINE>MIXED REACTION TO PROPOSED INCLUSION OF TAIWAN IN TMD SYSTEM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 2 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The passage of a bill by a committee of the
US House of Representatives calling for Taiwan to be included in a
theater missile defense (TMD) system received a mixed reaction from
legislators Thursday.</P>
      <P>Some legislators believed that if Taiwan agrees to such a
proposal, it will burden itself with enormous costs and might trigger
an arms race between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. Others said
Taiwan should accept the offer in order to better ensure its safety.</P>
      <P>Legislator Parris Chang of the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party said that he welcomed the US proposal, although he believed
that the proposal will be hard to implement. He added that the
proposal indicates that the United States is genuinely concerned
about the security of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chang said that even if the US Defense Department opposes the
plan, Taiwan should not abandon the idea of a theater missile defense
(TMD) system.</P>
      <P>Tsaur Eel-jong of the ruling Kuomintang recalled the words of
Defense Minister Chiang Chung-ling in describing the plan as a "money
pit."</P>
      <P>Tsaur also said that if Taiwan joins the TMD system, it will only
increase misgivings across the Taiwan Strait and possible trigger an
arms race which would hurt efforts to improve cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Lee Ching-hua of the opposition New Party also said that if Taiwan
agrees to cooperate with the United States, it will sour cross-strait
relations.</P>
      <P>Another New Party legislator, Lin Yu-fang, said that the TMD
system is still at the research and development stage, and that
Taiwan would have to shoulder astronomical costs if it wishes to be
included in the project.</P>
      <P>As the national defense budget is already enormous, Lin said, he
opposed accepting the proposal.</P>
      <P>Lin echoed Tsaur's opinion that Taiwan's participation will
trigger an arms race and destabilize relations between the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>According to reports from Washington, the International Relations
Committee of the US House of Representatives approved a bill by voice
vote on Tuesday that would require the secretary of defense to report
to Congress on how the United States would help Taiwan develop a
theater ballistic missile defense system against missile attacks from
mainland China.</P>
      <P>The bill says that the secretary of defense shall submit a report
to Congress no later than July 1, 1998, describing how the United
States would provide Taiwan with an advanced missile defense system.</P>
      <P>US defense officials said that the TMD system is derived from the
"Star Wars" defense initiative of the Reagan administration in the
1980s, with its magnitude reduced to a regional scope. The initial
research fund is estimated at US$9 billion, currently shared by the
United States and Japan.</P>
      <P>The officials said that the TMD system is expected to reach the
first-stage completion by the year 2002, with the total research and
development fund amounting to over US$20 billion.</P>

      <P>The Bank of Canada raised its benchmark Bank
Rate and operating band for the overnight rate by one quarter of a
percentage point Wednesday. The new Bank Rate is 3.75 percent and the
operating band is 3.25 percent to 3.75 percent.</P>
      <P>Announcing the increases, the bank said that in recent months
there has been growing evidence that the Canadian economy is
expanding rapidly and absorbing unused capacity. Indicators of
aggregate demand, output and money supply growth have all been
strong.</P>
      <P>The gathering momentum now evident in the economy has occurred
largely as a result of the substantial monetary support that has been
provided to offset the effects associated with private and public
sector restructuring.</P>
      <P>Given the lags between monetary policy actions and their effect
on the economy, timely action to moderate the extent of monetary
stimulus will contribute to making the economic expansion
long-lasting, the bank said.</P>
      <P>Canadian interest rates remain below those in the United States,

    <HEADLINE>CAA HEAD EXPECTS SOLUTION TO INTEREST RATE DEADLOCK WITH CAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  2  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Tsai Tuei, director general of the Civil
Aeronautics Administration (CAA), said Thursday that he believes the
dispute over an interest rate hike related to planes China Airlines
(CAL) leases from the government can be resolved.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that the CAA would terminate the lease with the flag
carrier and recover the planes only as the last resort.</P>
      <P>In order to address a trade imbalance with the United States a
decade ago, the government purchased 10 US-made planes, including
five 747-400s, one 747-200 and four MD-11s.</P>
      <P>CAL bought three of the planes and has been renting the remaining
seven from the CAA. The contract stated that CAL would pay an initial
interest rate of 3 percent, subject to review every three years
during the 10-and-a-half-year lease.</P>
      <P>The current interest rate of 5.44 percent was scheduled to last
until Oct. 22, 1999. But the previous session of the Legislative Yuan
asked that it be adjusted upward to 7.2 percent starting Oct. 4,
1997.</P>
      <P>CAL strongly protested the decision, saying the contract rate
should be honored until the 1999 expiration date. The airline also
pointed out that as it has a good credit rating, it would normally be
entitled to an interest rate lower than 7.2 percent.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that he believes a solution can be found that will be
satisfactory to the CAA and CAL as well as the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Tsay Jaw-yang, the minister of Transportation of Communications,
delivered an ultimatum to CAL Wednesday that if the airline did not
agree to pay the higher rate by Oct. 4, the ministry would terminate
the contract.</P>
      <P>Officials said if CAL does not comply, the ministry would
repossess all seven planes within two years and invite bidding to buy
or rent the aircraft.</P>
      <P>They noted, however, that the recall of the planes would have no
short-term tangible benefits since the government would have to spend
an estimated NT$913 million (US$32 million) on maintenance to keep
the planes airworthy.</P>

    <HEADLINE>USTR SAYS TAIPEI UNFAIRLY BLOCKING US PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  1 (CNA)
(By Herman Pan &amp; Lawrence Chu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US trade officials have urged Taiwan's
National Health Insurance Bureau not to impede the competitiveness of
US-made pharmaceuticals in the Taiwan market by setting recommended
price listings.</P>
      <P>The US Trade Representative's Office (USTR) said the bureau has
legitimate authority to control the costs of health care, but it
warned against practices such as price listing that could present
unfair barriers to US-manufactured pharmaceutical products.</P>
      <P>The warning was issued in a report prepared by the USTR office
together with its annual "Super 301" list of countries accused of
unfairly creating obstacles to US exports.</P>
      <P>The list and the accompanying report were drafted in accordance
with US law, which requires the USTR office to undertake retaliatory
measures against foreign countries that are deemed to engage in
unfair trade practices.</P>
      <P>While Taipei was not cited for retaliation, mention was made of
the ROC government-sponsored National Health Insurance program in the
report's "Other Bilateral Issues" section.</P>
      <P>The report referred to what it called barriers against sales of
US-made products in Taiwan's pharmaceutical market.</P>
      <P>US pharmaceutical manufacturers are concerned about measures
within Taiwan's system of recommended prices, the reports said.</P>
      <P>An American official told the Central News Agency that Washington
hopes to find a "reasonable solution" to the issue in the upcoming
round of bilateral consultations, scheduled for later this month.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a US association of pharmaceutical manufacturers,
PhRMA, released its own statement on the issue after the Super 301
list was announced.</P>
      <P>The statement complained against what it described as a bias
against American-made pharmaceuticals and newly developed medicinal
products in the Taiwan market. It also called on Taipei to recognize
"contributions made to Taiwan's new health care system" by American
pharmaceutical manufacturers, whose efforts were said to be focused
primarily on researching and developing original products.</P>
      <P>American manufacturers have said their main complaint is Taipei's
alleged practice of fixing low prices that favor domestic
manufacturers of generic pharmaceutical products over foreign
manufacturers that had originally researched and developed the
products.</P>
      <P>Such manufacturing, which saves Taiwan manufacturers the enormous
expense of developing new medicines, is legally permissible after the
original manufacturer's patent expires, they said.</P>
      <P>They asserted that the practice is not only creating obstacles to
imports, but also having negative effects on the quality of health
care in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POWELL SEES NOTHING TO HAPPEN ON TAIWAN ISSUE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Oct.  2  (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Retired Gen. Colin Powell said in
Singapore Wednesday that Taiwan is the likeliest flash point for a
conflict involving mainland China.</P>
      <P>The former chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff pointed out
"that is the one area where something could go wrong if we do not
handle the situation and watch it carefully," alluding to tensions
which have arisen from time to time across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>He said, however, that he does not expect anything to happen
because "the Chinese realize that it is in their interest not to have
anything happen."</P>
      <P>Powell also called on the international community to engage
rather than isolate mainland China.</P>
      <P>Beijing recognizes that the key to becoming a more successful and
wealthy nation is for it to participate in the world economic order,
he said.</P>
      <P>Powell, who served as chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff
from 1989 to 1993, made these points at a lunch talk organized by
Citibank as part of its Asian Leadership series, and at a subsequent
press conference. He left for home Wednesday night after a two-day
visit here.</P>
      <P>In his address, Powell noted that intellectuals and journals in
the United States have continued to ask whether there should be
engagement with or containment of Beijing and whether an economically
powerful mainland China would be a threat to the region.</P>
      <P>While he said his answer to the first issue was clear -- "We
engage" -- he chose to hedge on the second, saying that although the
situation needs watching, it is "too early to worry."</P>
      <P>Touching on the development and dynamism of the Asian region,
Powell pointed to mainland China as a "growing power."</P>
      <P>"They are becoming a power not because they have a superior
ideology or because the People's Liberation Army is superior. They
are becoming a power because they are participating in the
globalization of the world economic system," he said.</P>
      <P>"We should welcome that, encourage that, because the more they
come out, they will also feel that it is to their advantage to slowly
join the world system ... because over time, they will discover the
advantages of being part of that system."</P>
      <P>Powell said he believes Beijing has come to the conclusion that
the way to become more successful and prosperous is "not to threaten
its neighbors."</P>
      <P>"There are problems in places like the Spratlys, but I do not
think China is going to ruin its trading relationship over this
rock," he said in reference to the chain of islands in the South
China Sea that a number of countries have claimed as their territory.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT LEE ACCOMPANIES GOODALL ON TRIP TO KENTING PARK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.   2  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui on Thursday
accompanied Dr. Jane Goodall, commonly known as the "Mother of
Chimpanzees," on an inspection tour of the Kenting National Park at
the southernmost tip of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>They arrived at the Kenting park at 10 a.m.. During their brief
stopover at the Kenting resources exhibition hall, Goodall presented
President Lee with a citation in appreciation of his donation of NT$1
million (US$34,965) to the Jane Goodall Institute on Wednesday to
help the wildlife conservation institute set up a branch in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>For his part, Lee expressed the hope that the respected British
primatologist would take time out of her busy schedule to give
lectures at the "Lee Teng-hui Chair," a special teaching program at
Lee's alma mater, Cornell University in New York State.</P>
      <P>Before starting their tour of the scenic and ecologically rich
Kenting park, Lee and Goodall were briefed on the park's geological,
climatic, maritime and ecological conditions as well as its special
species of flora and fauna.</P>
      <P>Lee and Goodall, one of the world's three leading primatologists,
then toured a forestry recreational area, which is also a main
habitat of indigenous Formosan macaques.</P>
      <P>Standing atop a sea-observation tower, Goodall said she was
impressed by the Kenting park's natural scenery.</P>
      <P>In the afternoon, Goodall toured the park's Sheting area to see
for herself Taiwan conservationists' success in breeding the rare
Siko, also known as the Formosan spotted deer.</P>
      <P>The special indigenous animal had been extinct in Taiwan's
wilderness areas since 1969. The ROC government launched a
rehabilitation program in 1984, and, through long years of strenuous
efforts, specialists at Kenting have managed to increase the herd of
Siko deer to 200, some 80 of which have been released into the wild.</P>
      <P>Goodall said she was moved when she saw the rare deer species
roaming the woods freely. She was also excited when she unexpectedly
spotted a large flock of migrant birds resting on the Kenting beach.</P>
      <P>Goodall arrived in Taipei on Sunday for a six-day visit. This is
her second trip to this island. President Lee honored his promise to
accompany her on a Kenting trip to get a glimpse of Taiwan's wildlife
conservation programs and natural scenery.</P>
      <P>The 63-year-old primatologist, who has been studying chimpanzees
in Africa since 1957, has traveled around the world in recent years
to promote her "Roots and Shoots" campaign, a conservation program
for children.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday evening, Goodall attended a bazaar in Taipei, which
was organized by local environmentalists and industrialists to raise
funds for the planned Taiwan branch of the Jane Goodall Institute.
About NT$5 million in cash was raised during the bazaar.</P>
      <P>Earlier that day, Goodall addressed a group of young local
students, reminding them of the importance of protecting the natural
environment, conserving wildlife, and respecting and caring for human

    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Oct.  1  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Canadian researchers are closing in on a
vaccine against the parasite that infects up to 250 million women in
the world each year, a major Canadian newspaper reported Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Toronto Star noted that the vaccine would protect women from
the world's most common -- but least easily recognized -- venereal
disease.</P>
      <P>Trichomonas vaginalis is a tiny one-celled parasite that infects
millions of women annually, including hundreds of thousands in Canada
alone. Most men, and many women, who are infected show no symptoms
although they can spread the bug.</P>
      <P>Women who display symptoms commonly experience a vaginal
discharge that is easily confused with a yeast infection. In pregnant
women, however, the parasite increases risk of a premature delivery
by 30 to 40 percent, the daily quoted Dr. James McGregor of the
University of Colorado as telling a Toronto medical conference.</P>
      <P>And the condition may cause miscarriages during the early stages
of pregnancy, he added.</P>
      <P>Canadian scientists have been successful in infecting laboratory
mice with the parasite, and tests have produced a vaccine that
reduces the disease in these animals by 80 percent, said Dr. Gary
Garber, head of the division of infectious disease at the University
of Ottawa.</P>
      <P>A vaccination would be particularly useful for populations at
high risk of this parasite, he said. "In Canada, in the northern
regions of our country, trichomonas is endemic."</P>
      <P>In contrast to the relative neglect of this disease in humans,
McGregor said a vaccine already exists for a similar parasite that
attacks cattle, since farmers are concerned about losing calves.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FEWER HK RESIDENTS EXPECTED TO ATTEND DOUBLE TEN CELEBRATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 2 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>About 1,000 to 1,300 Hong Kong residents are
expected to come to Taipei next week to attend the Republic of
China's Double Ten National Day celebrations, a senior official said
on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The number is far lower than the 6,500 recorded last year,
according to government tallies.</P>
      <P>"The trend is understandable," Chu Chi-ying, minister of the
Cabinet-level Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, said, adding that
Hong Kong's reversion to mainland Chinese rule on July 1 has caused
"some inconveniences" for its residents to take part in this kind
of activities in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chu said his commission has not yet received complaints from ROC
expatriates in Hong Kong about restrictions on celebrating the ROC's
National Day, which falls on Oct. 10.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chu said, he hopes ROC expatriates there will take
into consideration their personal safety and the security of their
jobs in Hong Kong when they organize any ROC National Day celebration
activities.</P>
      <P>Overseas Chinese began to return to Taipei on Thursday in
preparation for attending the National Day celebrations. Chu said
more than 7,000 overseas Chinese from around the world are expected
to come to Taipei for various celebration programs this year.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Chu said, over 660 overseas Chinese organizations in
countries around the globe are actively preparing for Double Ten
festivities.</P>
      <P>Chu further said an estimated 250,000 overseas Chinese are
expected to attend diverse ROC National Day celebrations in worldwide
Chinese communities this year, far more than the 40,000 ethnic
Chinese who showed up at various festive programs marking communist
China's Oct. 1 National Day on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Noting that the majority of overseas Chinese remain loyal to the
Republic of China, Chu said many up-and-coming industrialists,
including those in high-technology industries, have voluntarily taken
time out of their busy schedules to organize Double Ten celebration
activities in their resident countries. Many of them have sent
invitations to the elite members of mainstream social and political
groups in those countries, Chu added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA TO BOOST DEFENSE SPENDING TO COPE WITH MILITARY BUILDUPS IN ASIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct.  1  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia plans to increase defense
spending and extend its military firepower to cope with rising
military buildups in the Asian region.</P>
      <P>Defense Minister Ian McLachlan on Tuesday released a progress
report on the implementation of defense management reforms under
which Australia will commit to increasing its military strength "to
keep abreast of the unprecedented growth and sophistication of
military capabilities within the region."</P>
      <P>The plan calls for the government to organize the Australian
Defense Force and the Department of Defense to find annual savings of
at least A$770 million to redirect to combat capability, according to
The Australian.</P>
      <P>The report from the review team says: "Finding and redistributing
savings to war-fighting capability will be a major step forward.
However, it is likely that more overall resources -- i.e. a high
proportion of gross domestic product -- will need to be allocated to
defense in future."</P>
      <P>McLachlan said the recommendation will be addressed in the
strategic review and taken into account "in the defense long-term
planning process."</P>
      <P>He said priorities for how the savings will be spent are to be
outlined in the strategic review. The capability priorities include
airborne early warning and control aircraft, expanding the
capabilities of the submarine fleet, modernizing combat aircraft and
increasing weapons and sensors on surface ships.</P>
      <P>Defense analysts said the plan to increase defense spending is
designed to cope with rising military buildups in mainland China,
Japan, Taiwan, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam and Thailand.</P>
      <P>They believe military buildups in the Asian Pacific area could
increase tension throughout the region and the only way to safeguard
Australia's interests accordingly is to increase its defense
spending.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A recent discovery by scientists here could
be a major landmark in the research on diabetes and sclerosis.</P>
      <P>Until now, no one understood what generated both illnesses,
rendering research for a treatment extremely difficult. But
scientists Bernard Mach and Bernard Conrad may have found the answer:
a retrovirus coded into our genetic pattern.</P>
      <P>Hundreds of such "sleeping viruses" are known to exist, their
origins dating back to the faraway past of human evolution, Mach
pointed out. Usually ineffectual, they can be "woken up" for reasons
yet to be understood. Once they are activated they attack certain
pancreatic cells and impair the production of insulin, resulting in
diabetes, he said.</P>
      <P>For sclerosis, he said, the mechanism is similar, except that
tissues are destroyed.</P>
      <P>The model remains to be confirmed by testing, but it has already
attracted international attention and could pave the way for a new

    <HEADLINE>STRIKE MAY SERIOUSLY DISRUPT AUSTRALIA'S COAL EXPORTS (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra, Oct. 2 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia's coal exports, the No. 1 export
earner here, are facing major disruption because almost half of the
nation's coal industry has been paralyzed by the three-day strike of
8,000 workers that began Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The strikes, affecting 52 mines, are in protest of the
government's crackdown on unions after mining giant Rio Tinto
unveiled plans to seek court injunctions against union officials and
some workers over picket lines at its strike-bound Hunter Valley No.
1 mine in New South Wales (NSW).</P>
      <P>The Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), the biggest union
in this country, warned of a national strike and its president Jennie
Gorge declared that "bad laws were meant to be broken."</P>
      <P>The Taipei Economic and Cultural Office (TECO) in Canberra is
keeping a close watch on the dispute with an eye toward its possible
impact on Taiwan, TECO's economic section director Henry Yang said.</P>
      <P>"If the dispute can be solved shortly, then the production
stoppage caused by the three-day strike will have little effect on
our economy," he said in an interview. "However, we would be worried
if the strike were to be prolonged."</P>
      <P>Australia supplies about one third of Taiwan's coal. The United
States, South Africa, Canada, Indonesia and mainland China also
export coal to the island.</P>
      <P>Rio Tinto's management rejected NSW Premier Bob Carr's call
Wednesday night to accept arbitration by the government's Industrial
Relations Commission (IRC).</P>
      <P>Mine manager Allan Davies told Carr the arbitration would not
deliver the changes the company needs to improve the mine's
productivity but would only create further disputes over
interpretations of rulings.</P>
      <P>The IRC told coal companies Wednesday it would furnish
injunctions Thursday ordering miners back to work.</P>
      <P>Federal Workplace Relations Minister Peter Reith said Carr should
back Rio Tinto's attempts to reform the coal industry.</P>
      <P>The strike against Rio Tinto is the second in about three months
over disputes related to the hiring of workers. Rio Tinto wants to
employ workers through individual contracts, but the union -- the
Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (CFMEU) -- wants the
company to hire workers through union contracts.</P>

      <P>Hundreds of coal workers at Rio Tinto's Hunter Valley mines
recently ended a six week strike. But plans by Rio Tinto to seek
court injunctions to sue union members over their picket lines last
month angered the CFMEU, which launched the larger strike in
retaliation.</P>
      <P>The Australian government is sympathetic with Rio Tinto as Reith
is trying to reform industrial productivity to make Australia more
competitive in the world market.</P>
      <P>But the government's support for the company is facing
ever-increasing opposition from the ACTU and CFMEU, both powerful
unions.</P>
      <P>The unions intend to expand the stoppage district-by-district,
closing mines from Wollongong, New South Wales, to Queensland.</P>
      <P>Australia's ports are also expected to face the threat of
industrial action with the Maritime Union of Australia (MUA) pledging
Wednesday to join the strike if the CFMEU asks it to.</P>
      <P>"If we get call from that union for assistance, we will be
honoring our obligations of mutual support," MUA assistant national
secretary Vic Slater told reporters.</P>
      <P>Exports from the nation's biggest coal port, Newcastle, are now
facing major disruption as more than 20 ships are anchored nearby,
waiting to load coal for export to Taiwan, Japan, South Korea and
other locations, company sources said.</P>

reach a compromise.</P>

      <P>A total of 342 separatists belonging to the
Turkish Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) have been killed so far in the
ongoing Turkish government's cross-border operation against PKK
strongholds in northern Iraq since last week, a Turkish military
official said, adding that Turkish jets bombed fleeing separatists
near Iraq's mountainous border with Iran on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The official said warplanes bombed the separatists as Turkish
troops pursued them eastwards after capturing the PKK's main base at
Zap in northern Iraq a day earlier. Turkish forces, backed by air
support, attacked three other camps near the Turkish border in an
effort to dislodge the PKK, who had regrouped there.</P>
      <P>About 15,000 Turkish troops and more than 100 tanks entered Iraq
last week in a push that has angered Baghdad, which lost control of
northern Iraq to Iraqi Kurdish groups after the 1991 Gulf War. The
PKK uses bases in northern Iraq to launch attacks into Turkey. More
than 26,000 people have been killed during the PKK's 13-year campaign

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 3 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The domestic textile industry is expected to
overcome recent difficulties and upgrade its global competitiveness,
the Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) said Friday.</P>
      <P>The BOFT noted that major international textile manufacturers
have faced dramatic changes since the 1990s, including stiff
competition from low-cost producers in Eastern Europe and mainland
China. They also have seen the emergence of regional economic blocs,
which hinder exports to the countries in those groupings.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, the textile industry has encountered the appreciation
of the New Taiwan Dollar, a shortage of labor, rising wages for
workers, as well as difficulty in acquiring land for factories and
protests from environmental activists, BOFT officials said.</P>
      <P>The government's liberalization policy also means more
competition from foreign products due to reduced import tariffs, they
said. Consequently, the contribution of the textile sector as a share
of the total production value in the manufacturing industry has
steadily declined in recent years. It is estimated that by the year
2002, the number of textile plants in Taiwan will fall to 5,800, with
290,000 persons employed and an annual production value of NT$900
billion (US$31.35 billion).</P>
      <P>But the textile industry has played a major role in contributing
to Taiwan's huge trade surpluses in the past. BOFT officials said
that textile exports in 1996 totaled US$15.5 billion, while imports
amounted to only US$3.62 billion in 1996, creating a US$11.88 billion
trade surplus.</P>
      <P>The officials said that as Taiwan's textile industry has
established sound marketing and production networks, actively
researched the development of new materials and upgraded its design
capability, it should be able to successfully overcome recent
challenges and upgrade its competitiveness.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING SAID TO ABOLISH ONE-CHILD POLICY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo, Oct. 3 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing plans to abolish the one-child policy
it has implemented since the late 1970s, reported a Japanese economic
daily on Thursday.</P>
      <P>In mainland China's 640 cities where the one-child policy has
been enforced, bearing a second child will soon be permitted once
again.</P>
      <P>The Japanese newspaper indicated in its report from Beijing that
the mainland's central government does not oppose the new practice,
primarily because China's population is gradually aging. In addition,
the one-child policy has been the target of severe criticism by
Westerners from a human rights standpoint.</P>
      <P>According to the report, among a total population of 1.2 billion,
only 360 million people reside in the 640 cities which promote the
one-child limit. Authorities in Beijing have confirmed that the
restriction in those cities will henceforth be "limited to one
generation," while other areas will "have the right to stipulate
their own rules in accordance with respective local conditions."</P>
      <P>The eldest members of the generation born after the one-child
policy was implemented in 1979 are now 18 years of age. It is
expected that the relaxed regulations will not become applicable
before they reach marriageable age in their early 20s.</P>
      <P>Some of the domestic factors prompting the change include the
fact that the ratio of the mainland population over 60 years of age
now accounts for 10 percent of the total. An aging society will
adversely affect the welfare of the younger generation. Also, with
the cost of living in urban areas steadily rising, it is expected
that population levels in major cities will not increase dramatically
even if the one-child restriction is lifted, the report added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PARAGUAY SEEKING ROC AID FOR AIRPORT RENOVATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Asuncion,  Oct.  2  (CNA)
(By Stephen Shen and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government of Paraguay will ask the
Republic of China to assist in renovating its major international
airport in suburban Asuncion, a senior official said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Paraguayan Defense Minister Hugo Estigarribia Elizeche told the
local press that Paraguay will seek Taiwan's technical and financial
assistance for repairing and refurbishing the facility, located some
16 kilometers from Asuncion's downtown area.</P>
      <P>The airport renovation project, including renewal of its runways
and radar systems, will call for an estimated outlay of US$35 million
to US$40 million, according to Estigarribia.</P>
      <P>The minister said Paraguay has yet to decide which form of
assistance it will request from the ROC, but stressed that the aid
will greatly contribute to one of his country's most important
infrastructure development projects.</P>
      <P>ROC Ambassador to Paraguay Liu Ting-tsu said Paraguayan Minister
of Foreign Affairs Ruben Melgarejo Lanzoni mentioned the airport
renovation during their meeting on Wednesday. "But we didn't discuss
any details concerning the program," Liu said.</P>
      <P>Sources said the ROC Embassy here will refer the issue back to
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for study.</P>
      <P>The Asuncion international airport has been in poor condition due
to many years of use, with its runways dilapidated and radar systems
malfunctioning. The international flight safety organization has
warned the Paraguayan government if it fails to take contingent
measures to improve the airport's equipment, the organization will
ban international airlines from landing at the airport.</P>
      <P>The EVA Air Boeing 747 plane which took ROC President Lee
Teng-hui and his entourage to Paraguay for a four-day state visit in
mid-September was the first such aircraft in many years to land and
take off at the Asuncion airport.</P>
      <P>Paraguay is the ROC's only diplomatic ally in South America. The
two countries signed an aviation agreement during Lee's visit, paving
the way for the inauguration of direct flight services between the
two countries in the future.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI ASKS MAINLAND TO OPEN MORE MAJOR SEAPORTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  3  (CNA)
(By Debbie Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Unless mainland China opens more major
seaports to cross-strait shipping operations, Taipei will not
consider implementing a plan to grant customs clearance services and
allow landing privileges for mainland seamen, officials in charge of
shipping affairs said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Beijing authorities currently allow only the mainland ports of
Fuzhou and Xiamen to handle the long-negotiated cross-strait shipping
trade.</P>
      <P>By comparison, the officials from the ROC's Ministry of
Transportation and Communications (MOTC) said that since April this
year Taipei has liberalized a great number of related policy
regulations to help accelerate cross-strait shipping operations.</P>
      <P>They pointed out that Taipei has opened direct shipping between
Taiwan and the mainland for cargo which is transported through a
third place, usually Hong Kong. It also allows mainland Chinese-owned
foreign-registered vessels to anchor at Taiwan ports and has lowered
port charges.</P>
      <P>In addition, Taipei is now prepared to allow big ships,
regardless of their country of registration, to sail between Taiwan's
Kaohsiung Harbor and any mainland port under an offshore
transshipment program. In the future, all of Taiwan's export
processing zones and special economic zones will also be included in
the program, the officials noted.</P>
      <P>On the contrary, they said, Beijing has done nothing to promote
cross-strait shipping links other than to open Fuzhou and Xiamen, two
minor seaports in southern province of Fujian.</P>
      <P>Fuzhou and Xiamen have a combined cargo capacity of 450,000 TEUs
(twenty-foot-equivalent units). Since the cross-strait transshipment
trade with Kaohsiung Harbor began in April, the two ports have
handled only 150,000 TEUs of cargo, statistics show.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung Harbor, on the other hand, has a capacity of 1.5
million TEUs, and other Taiwan ports, including Keeling, Hualien and
Taichung, have also been designated to join the offshore
transshipment program.</P>
      <P>Shipping operators from both Taiwan and mainland China have urged
that other major mainland Chinese seaports, such as Guangzhou,
Shanghai, Qingdao, Tienjin and Dalien, be allowed to join the
offshore transshipment links. The officials noted that this will not
only promote Taiwan's and mainland China's shipping sectors, but will
also benefit foreign carriers as well.</P>

NO HURRY FOR NEW TAIPEI-PRETORIA CONSULTATION: MOFA</P>
      <P>Taipei, Oct. 3 (CNA) A new round of high-level negotiations
between the Republic of China and South Africa originally slated for
Oct. 5 in Pretoria will be postponed indefinitely, the Ministry of
Economic Affairs (MOFA) said on Friday.</P>
      <P>ROC Vice Foreign Minister Chen Chien-jen and his South African
counterpart Aziz Pahad had been set to discuss a new framework for
future bilateral exchanges after the two countries suspend diplomatic
ties at the end of this year. It will be postponed to an unspecified
later date because of Pahad's tight schedule, said Timothy Yang,
director of the MOFA's African Affairs Department.</P>
      <P>Yang said that in fact Taipei feels no urgency to hold such a
meeting since the two governments have already reached consensus on
major issues related to the conduct of future relations during a
visit by Pahad to Taipei in June.</P>
      <P>Deputy foreign ministers from Taipei and Pretoria may well meet
again after lower-ranking officials complete one or two more rounds
of working-level talks, Yang added.</P>
      <P>South African President Nelson Mandela announced in November 1996
that Pretoria will switch diplomatic recognition from Taipei to
Beijing at the end of 1997.</P>
      <P>The ROC's foreign affairs minister at that time, John Chang,
traveled to Pretoria on in early December of 1996, in an unsuccessful
last-ditch effort to salvage the bilateral ties. He announced on Dec.
5 the recall of Taipei's ambassador to South Africa and the
suspension of all aid projects to that country after fruitless
meetings with Mandela and Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo.</P>
      <P>The two governments have held several rounds of working-level
negotiations on future bilateral relations during the past eight
months. Issues surrounding the fate of the ROC's three consulates
general in South Africa, nevertheless, remain unresolved.</P>
      <P>Taipei has expressed that it would like to maintain its
consulates general, located in Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban,
after the two countries sever diplomatic ties on Dec. 31. Pretoria
has yet to make a decision on the matter.</P>

(By Bill Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Sen. Tom Daschel (D-SD) and Sen. Connie Mack (R-FL) signed on
Wednesday to the resolution submitted on May 23 by Sen. Jesse Helms
(R-NC), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Their
moves brought to 20 the number of co-sponsors.</P>
      <P>The resolution, which is pending in Sen. Helms' committee, notes
that the membership of Taiwan in the IMF would benefit the world
economy, especially those developing countries in need of capital. It
would also contribute to the IMF's purposes as the island has the
world's 14th largest economy, seventh largest amount of foreign
investment, and one of the largest foreign exchange reserves.</P>
      <P>The resolution notes that the IMF, which aims to advance
worldwide economic relationships, is not a political entity, as
evidenced by the fact that Taiwan remained a member of that body
until 1980, eight years after it was forced to give up its membership
in the United Nations.</P>
      <P>As IMF membership is a prerequisite for accession to the
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and
regional banks in which the membership of Taiwan would be beneficial
and fully justified, it goes on, it is the sense of Congress that US
policy should support Taiwan's admission to the IMF, the IBRD and all
appropriate regional multilateral economic institutions.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Greece and the Greek Cypriots have sent
letters to UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan defending the purchase and
future deployment of Russian-made S-300 missiles on Cypress, the
Turkish semi-official Anatolia news agency reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>Under a US$250 million agreement signed with Russia earlier this
year, the Greek Cypriots have purchased at least 150 S-300 missiles,
whose 150-kilometer range can reach Turkey's Mediterranean military
bases. The Greek Cypriots plan to deploy these missiles on the island
next year, in a move that has angered Turkey.</P>
      <P>In their letters, Greece and the Greek Cypriots said that Greek
Cyprus is an independent state and it has the right to take the
measures necessary to ensure its defense, Anatolia reported. The
letters also claimed that Turkey is occupying a part of Cyprus in
contravention of UN Security Council resolutions.</P>
      <P>Greece's letter pointed out that as a guarantor of Cyprus, it
feels responsible for helping the Greek Cypriots with their defense
needs. Meanwhile, the Russian ambassador to Nicosia, Gorgie Muradov,
said that Greek Cyprus is an independent state and the arms it
procured are intended to strengthen its defense capability, Anatolia

    <HEADLINE>YOU CAN'T SEE THE FORESTS FOR THE FIRES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Oct.  2  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The stories about forest fires that
blanketed much of Southeast Asia seems to have dropped from the
world's attention. This is most unfortunate, a Canadian columnist
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Eric Margolis of the Sun newspapers said Indonesia and other
Asian nations that tolerate the wholesale rapine of their forests
deserve international condemnation.</P>
      <P>According to UN studies, as much as one-third of Southeast Asia's
old-growth forests have been destroyed. While ecological groups have
long protested this atrocity, it was not until last week's run-amok
incineration that the full scale of the environmental disaster
created by rapacious businessmen and greedy politicians became
terrifyingly apparent, he said.</P>
      <P>He noted that each year, Indonesian forestry firms set vast fires
on the islands of Sumatra and Borneo to burn off undergrowth in order
to get at virgin stands of valuable hardwood timber.</P>
      <P>Monsoon rains usually extinguish the fires. But this year, the El
Nino meteorological phenomena is causing intense drought in Southeast
Asia and Australia, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Smoke and haze from Indonesia's manmade fires quickly combined
with Southeast Asia's filthy, polluted urban air, producing a
life-threatening brew that contributed to a major air crash in
Sumatra and a ship sinking, Margolis added.</P>
      <P>The noxious haze reached as far away as Malaysia, Burma, southern
Thailand, Singapore, and the Philippines, causing an epidemic of
respiratory ailments. "This totally avoidable disaster should be a
final warning to Asian nations to start respecting norms of
environmental decency and basic common sense," he claimed.</P>
      <P>Much of the region is an eco-disaster area, he said. Each major
Asian city has different colored air. Beijing's is brown, Tokyo's
gray, Manila's yellow. Bangkok, which has the most nightmarish
traffic jams on earth, has green air. Dust, automotive exhaust,
burning garbage, and belching smokestacks give Asian cities the
world's worst air, except for their sisters in soot -- Athens, Mexico
City, Sao Paulo and Cairo, according to Margolis.</P>
      <P>He said Japanese industry bears a heavy responsibility for this
disaster. Japan's Shinto faith teaches reverence for nature and
trees. Yet Japan is the main customer for Southeast Asia's
strip-mined forests, which it consumes with thoughtless and
relentless prodigality, he wrote.</P>
      <P>For Japanese, "shibui" -- love of nature -- stops at home, he
observed.</P>
      <P>It's easy, of course, to criticize Asians or Brazilians. North
Americans long ago felled their magnificent virgin forests. Even
today, "our few remaining stands of ancient woods are being razed by
forestry firms that share the same brutish mentality as hunters who
slaughter terrified, helpless animals and call it sport," he pointed
out.</P>
      <P>Indonesia's incredibly irresponsible actions also remind us that
a major international issue in coming years will be ecological
aggression. Nations like China, Taiwan, Mexico, Thailand, Japan and
India that pump uncontrolled pollutants into the air may one day be
branded international outlaws, he predicted.</P>
      <P>Cross-border contamination could become as much a "causus belli"
as armed invasion, he noted.</P>
      <P>The catastrophe in Indonesia warns that urgent action is required
by civilized nations to save remaining forests from commercial
vandalism, he warned.</P>

      <P>The Australian government has launched a

to buy products made in Australia.</P>
      <P>Trade Minister Tim Fischer launched the program in Sydney on
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Under the scheme, shoppers will collect special stamps from
businesses selling Australian-made goods, including gas stations.</P>
      <P>The stamps are used to fill the Advantage Australia Passbooks,
which can be redeemed for special offers such as discounts and
rewards. Details of the rewards have yet to be released.</P>
      <P>Two million passbooks will be distributed in Sunday newspapers

    <HEADLINE>EU TIGHTENS RULES ON GENETIC FOOD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  Oct.  2  (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Food produced from genetically modified
soybeans or maize will have to carry special labels under regulations
adopted by the European Commission, according to reports from the
Geneva-based World Trade Organization (WTO) Thursday.</P>
      <P>The decision, to be implemented on Nov. 1, is a victory for
consumer groups but could cause friction with trading partners and
European importers.</P>
      <P>More than half of processed foods contain soybeans or
derivatives. Many importers mix genetically modified soy with
ordinary soy.</P>
      <P>Under EC regulations, food wrappers will have to indicate the
presence of genetically modified soy or maize.</P>
      <P>If there is uncertainty about whether the contents of a
particular product are modified, the label must state this as well,
the WTO report said.</P>
      <P>The decision, made in agreement with all 15 European Union
member-states, put soybeans and maize into a category with other
"novelty foods" which have been subject to similar requirements since
May 1.</P>
      <P>The novelty food regulation requires that the end consumer be
informed of the presence of any food properties that render a food or
food ingredient "no longer equivalent" to an existing product.</P>
      <P>It is intended to cover a range of biosynthetic and other
technological processes.</P>
      <P>Genetically modified soybeans and maize had previously escaped
the novelty food regulations because they were approved for use
before the directive came into force.</P>
      <P>That approval has caused widespread controversy. Luxembourg and
Austria are resisting attempts by the Commission to force them into
lifting import bans on genetically modified maize. Both countries
have said they are prepared to take the issue to court.</P>
      <P>The controversy is likely to be heightened over the next few
months as the EU attempts to clarify exactly what the food labels
covered by the novelty foods and modified soybeans and maize should
say and whether they should carry symbols.</P>
      <P>Genetically modified maize has been developed by Novartis, the
Swiss biotechnology company, to resist the corn borer pest.
Genetically modified soybeans have been developed by Monsanto, the US
chemical giant.</P>
      <P>The EU licensed both products for sale after they were declared
safe by scientific advisers, who also unanimously backed the EC's
decision to label those items.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DIRECT TRADE WITH M'LAND CHINA STILL UNDER ASSESSMENT, SAYS PM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  3  (CNA)
(By Debbie Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has no "concrete plans" yet to
conduct direct trade with arch rival mainland China as related
government agencies are still assessing its feasibility, Premier
Vincent Siew said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Siew stressed that the government will make a comprehensive
assessment on issues surrounding the "three direct links" -- post,
trade and shipping -- with mainland China as part of an effort to
improve cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Maintaining national security and dignity must be prerequisites
for considering the three direct links projects, which involve a wide
range of issues, Siew noted.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks during a plenary session at the Legislative
Yuan in response to a question by Kuomintang Legislator Wang
Tien-ching on whether the direct-trade issue would be on agenda if
Taipei indeed resumes dialogue with Beijing in the near future.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen Jui-lung, director-general of the Board of
Foreign Trade (BOFT), said plans on direct trade with mainland China
hinge on the National Reunification Guidelines and changing of the
nation's mainland China policies.</P>
      <P>Although the BOFT has continuously carried out research on trade
relations across the Taiwan Strait, no concrete policies have been
made yet on this matter, he added.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a press conference, Chen said that since Taiwan
opened indirect trade across the Taiwan Strait in 1989, Taipei has
granted permission for 5,318 categories of industrial and
agricultural products to be imported to Taiwan from mainland China
via a third place.</P>
      <P>In an effort to widen Taiwan manufacturers' access to more
low-cost materials and semi-finished products, Taiwan further
liberalized restrictions on mainland imports in 1996, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Before July 1, 1996, all products not listed as approved for
import were forbidden. On that date, however, the government reversed
this by publishing a list of categories of products forbidden to
enter Taiwan, allowing all others to be imported.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FOUR PILLARS OWNER INDICATED FOR THEFT OF TRADE SECRETS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.2  (CNA)
(By Herman Pan &amp; Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The owner of Taiwan-based Four Pillars
Enterprise and his daughter will go to trial in the United States
following a federal grand jury indictment on 21 charges related to
the theft of commercial secrets announced by the US Justice
Department on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Businessman Yang Pin-yen and his daughter Yang Hwei-chen were
arrested by US investigators Sept. 4 on charges of conspiracy, mail
and wire fraud, money laundering, possession of stolen goods and
theft of technological know-how from the Avery Dennison Corporation
of Pasadena, California. They were freed on bail 13 days later and
been subject to electronic monitoring since that time.</P>
      <P>With no significant deviations from the original charges, the
indictment alleges that Yang, 70, and his 39-year-old daughter, the
manager for research and development at Four Pillars, carried out the
scheme over nearly a decade, spanning from 1989 to 1997, with the
assistance of Lee Ten-hong, a Dennison employee.</P>
      <P>The Yangs' alleged theft of trade secrets would violate the 1996
Economic Espionage Act, the department said. Any violation of the law
carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison, along with a
US$500,000 fine.</P>
      <P>Yang Ping-yen's Cleveland-based lawyer Patrick McLaughlin told
CNA that the Yangs will plead not guilty to the charges against them
at their arraignment by the state of Ohio's North District Court next
week.</P>
      <P>According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Lee
confessed to his involvement in the crime last March, revealing that
he received between US$140,000 and US$150,000 from Four Pillars over
the eight-year period for providing the company with valuable
technical know-how owned by Dennison.</P>
      <P>In early June, Lee bargained with the FBI and prosecutors to face
a less severe charge of wire fraud in exchange for his full
cooperation in building a case against the Yangs and Four Pillars,
which produces and markets adhesive products in the US, Taiwan,
mainland China and Malaysia.</P>
      <P>Avery Dennison is listed as one of the largest manufacturers in
the US of self-adhesive products like postage stamps and tape for
disposable diapers, employing over 16,000 personnel worldwide.</P>
      <P>An estimate by the US Justice Department indicated that the value
of the trade secrets allegedly stolen by Four Pillars amounted to
between US$50 million and US$60 million.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Dennison has filed a separate civil lawsuit against
the Yangs and their company in order to seek compensation for the
losses.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  3  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of Russian parliamentarians are
promoting legislation on relations with Taiwan to facilitate
bilateral exchanges, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs official said on
Friday.</P>
      <P>Wang Wei-chieh, director of the ministry's West Asian Affairs
department, told a routine news conference that Alexei Mitrofonov,
chairman of the Geographical Policy Committee of the State Duma, the
lower house of the Russian parliament, has introduced a bill on
better regulating substantive Moscow-Taipei ties.</P>
      <P>The bill was patterned after the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA), a US
law regulating relations between Taiwan and the United States in the
absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>Wang said the Mitrofonov-drafted bill provides for Taiwan-Russian
civilian and commercial exchanges. Though the bill does not mention
security commitments and arms sales to Taiwan like the US act, its
content is very agreeable for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to the Russian parliamentary rules, the bill must be
approved by the Foreign Affairs Committee before it is referred to
the plenary session for a second reading.</P>
      <P>Wang said Mitrofonov called a public hearing on the bill in July,
during which Russian Foreign Ministry officials voiced strong
opposition to the bill. They said there was no need for new
legislation since Russian President Boris Yeltsin had already issued
an administrative decree to regulate unofficial Taipei-Moscow ties,
adding the bill violated Russia's "one China" policy.</P>
      <P>The bill has also drawn a strong backlash from the
mainalnd Chinese embassy in Moscow, Wang noted.</P>
      <P>As Russia has maintained far closer ties with Beijing than
Taipei, Wang said, the bill is not expected to clear the Duma easily.</P>
      <P>"Still, the bill marks a good beginning for our relations with
Moscow," Wang said, adding that the bill still stands a chance to
pass the Russian legislature through intense discussion and
deliberation.</P>
      <P>Touching on the privileges for ROC officials stationed in Moscow,
Wang said a major breakthrough was achieved in this regard in
September. Russian authorities have agreed to draft a bill providing
for diplomatic immunities and other privileges to ROC officials.</P>
      <P>The Russian parliament is expected to pass the bill before the
end of this year, Wang said, adding, "By then, our representative
office in Moscow will enjoy more freedoms to complete its work."</P>
      <P>Wang said ROC-Russian relations have taken a big step forward
since the inauguration of the Russian representative office in
Taipei last December.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wang said direct flight services between the two
countries are expected to start next spring to further boost
bilateral tourist, cultural and commercial exchanges.</P>
      <P>After more than three years of negotiations, Taiwan and Russia
formally signed an agreement on the establishment of direct airlinks
earlier this year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER SAYS CROSS-STRAIT HOSTILITY TERMINATED IN 1991</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  3  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew said Friday that the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait have not been in a state of hostility
since May 1991.</P>
      <P>Siew made the remarks when responding to questions by Legislator
Kao Yu-jen. Kao asked if the two both sides of the Taiwan Strait have
terminated their state of hostility by law.</P>
      <P>Siew said that when the ROC constitutionally terminated the
Temporary Provisions Effective During the Period of National
Mobilization in May 1991, it substantially acknowledged the
termination of hostility and the fact of separate rule on the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The ROC has taken the initiative to unilaterally renounce the use
of force, and will instead employ only peaceful and democratic means
to pursue national unification, Siew said.</P>
      <P>Siew said that since the termination of the temporary provisions,
Taipei has regarded Beijing as a political entity that has
jurisdiction over mainland China. He pointed out that the ROC has
also abolished the Statutes for the Purging of Communist Agents, as
well as the Statutes for the Punishment of Insurrection.</P>
      <P>Siew expressed the hope that Beijing would acknowledge Taiwan's
sincerity and efforts in promoting cross-strait relations by making
its own reciprocal announcement indicating the cessation of
hostilities.</P>
      <P>Kao also asked if Siew would stand by statements he had made as a
legislator, urging the two sides to engage in talks regarding what is
known as the "three links" -- direct postal, trade and transportation
contacts -- and to set up offices of Taipei's Straits Exchange
Foundation and its Beijing counterpart, the Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), in each other's capital. The two
intermediary bodies were set up to handle civilian exchanges between
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait in the absence of formal ties.</P>
      <P>Siew said that his stance has not changed but the premise of
those suggestions will be that both sides deal with each other with
respect and recognize the fact of separate rule.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO CHANGE IN RELATIONS WITH BEIJING: MARTIN LEE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hong  Kong,  Oct.  3  (CNA)
(By Stanley Cheung &amp; Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Hong Kong Democratic Party Chairman
Martin Lee observed Thursday that his presence at celebrations
organized by the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (HKSAR) to mark mainland China's national day does not mean
that relations between his party and the Chinese Communist Party have
made great advances.</P>
      <P>Lee came to the fore in 1989 by leading the people of Hong Kong
in support for mainland students' protests for democratic reforms.
Beijing crushed the protests in the Tiananmen Square massacre of June
4 that year.</P>
      <P>Beijing has criticized the Hong Kong Democratic Party in recent
years as an "anti-China" organization aimed at stirring up trouble
and has prohibited its members, including Lee, from entering mainland
China.</P>
      <P>During its years as a British colony, Hong Kong held no
celebrations of mainland China's national day. The Hong Kong bureau
of the Xinhua news agency, then the de facto mainland embassy,
sponsored some activities but never invited members of the Democratic
Party to these.</P>
      <P>When, three months after Hong Kong's handover to mainland
control, Lee and other core members of the Democratic Party attended
the HKSAR government's banquet for mainland China's national day,
much speculation arose that the party had changed its attitude
toward Beijing.</P>
      <P>Lee said at the banquet that he is confident he will be permitted
later to visit his homeland.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The head of the German Trade Office in
Taipei said on Friday that he expects German investment in Taiwan
will grow considerably as a result of the steps toward liberalization
that the government of the Republic of China has taken in pursuit of
its project to develop the island into an Asia-Pacific operations hub
and in preparation for its accession to the World Trade Organization
(WTO).</P>
      <P>Hilmar Kaht, director-general of the office, made the remarks at
a reception marking the seventh anniversary of Germany's
reunification. Several ROC officials, including Fredrick Chien,
speaker of the National Assembly, and Vice Foreign Minister Francisco
H.L. Ou, were present.</P>
      <P>Kaht said that Taiwan and Germany have many characteristics in
common, noting that both are highly industrialized and
export-oriented, and depend to a significant extent on trade and
investment abroad.</P>
      <P>"With regard to this, Germany and Taiwan have reason to be well
satisfied with each other," he said, noting that Taiwan is his
country's fourth largest trade partner in the Asia-Pacific area, with
an overall bilateral trade volume of US$9 billion in 1996.</P>
      <P>Germany is Taiwan's largest trade partner in Europe, he added.</P>
      <P>The representative also said that Taiwan-German trade and
economic relations have been further enhanced by meetings and an

    <HEADLINE>FOUR MORE COUNTRIES APPEAL FOR ROC'S UN BID</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  Oct.  2  (CNA)
(By K. C. Huang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Four more countries appealed for the
Republic of China's bid to rejoin the United Nations at the UN
General Assembly debate on Friday.</P>
      <P>The four ROC diplomatic allies -- the Commonwealth of Dominica,
Senegal, Liberia and Chad -- cited a variety of reasons to back
the ROC's UN bid.</P>
      <P>Edison James, prime minister of the Commonwealth of
Dominica, said in his address to the General Assembly debate
session that the ROC was a UN founding member and once played an
important role in the world body. Moreover, James said, the ROC is a
robust, prosperous democracy, with its government and parliament
elected through universal suffrage.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, James said, all UN member states should
not continue to ignore or block the ROC's efforts to rejoin the
world body.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Senegal's minister of foreign
affairs, Moustapha Niasse, said readmission of the ROC will not only
reinforce the UN's principle of membership universality but will
also bring justice to the people of that country.</P>
      <P>Niasse stressed that the ROC's economic, social and
political developments all follow the directions set in the UN
Charter and its contributions to the international community have
proved that it is capable of fulfilling its obligations as a UN
member.</P>
      <P>Liberian Minister of Foreign Affairs Monie Captan said Liberia
is also a UN founding member and has consistently backed the
inclusion of all countries into the UN system. "Our policy is that
any country which intends to join the UN should be given the right to
realize its goal."</P>
      <P>Captan said the UN General Assembly's 1971 Resolution No. 2758,
which expelled the ROC to make way for communist China, was
inappropriate, adding the UN should re-examine the resolution and
let the ROC have a voice in the world body.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that the parallel participation in the UN by
the ROC and mainland China will not hinder China's eventual peaceful
reunification. "Such an arrangement will also contribute to regional
security and world peace."</P>
      <P>Mahamat Saleh Annadif, Chad's minister of foreign affairs, said
the Chad government and people support the ROC's reentry into the
world body based on the UN's own principle of membership
universality.</P>
      <P>Chad resumed diplomatic ties with the ROC in August 1997 after a
25-year hiatus. Its president, Colonel Idriss Deby, will make a
state visit to Taiwan on Oct. 15-19.</P>
      <P>The ROC lost its seat in the UN in 1971 when the world body
accepted the communist government in Beijing as the sole
representative of the Chinese people.</P>
      <P>The UN General Assembly's steering committee on Sept. 17
rejected for a fifth straight year a request to consider the
question of ROC representation. This year's petition, signed by 14
of Taipei's diplomatic allies, called for the re-examination of
Resolution No. 2758.</P>
      <P>A total of 15 countries -- Nicaragua, Fiji, Paraguay, El
Salvador, Honduras, the Dominican Republic, Saint Christopher and
Nevis, Swaziland, Burkina Faso, Belize, the Commonwealth of
Dominica, Senegal, Chad and Liberia -- have so far spoken for the
ROC's UN bid since the current General Assembly debate session
started on Sept. 22.</P>

    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct.  3  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China has asked Australia to
provide a "safer sex" education program for its nearly 300 million
adolescents so that it can reduce abortions and slow population
growth.</P>
      <P>Mainland China already has 1.2 billion inhabitants.</P>
      <P>Under a A$500,000 (US$362,000) four-year pilot program,
Australian experts will help mainland China map out plans to reduce
abortions, slow population growth and provide information about the
prevention of sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV-AIDS.</P>
      <P>Professor Roger Short, a reproductive physiologist with the Royal
Women's Hospital and the University of Melbourne, told a meeting of
the Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of
Science in Adelaide on Thursday that Beijing has no national strategy
for reaching the nation's youth, who increasingly are breaking with
tradition and becoming sexually active.</P>
      <P>Traditionally, mainland China's family planning efforts have
relied upon social sanctions against premarital sex, a minimum legal
marriage age of 24 years and the use of contraceptives after the
birth of the first child, Short said.</P>
      <P>He estimated contraceptive failures led to eight million
abortions in mainland China last year.</P>
      <P>He said reports that girl babies were selectively aborted in
mainland China were incorrect. In fact, he said, new research shows
that girls are "under-reported" at birth so couples can try again for
a boy without officially violating Beijing's one-child policy.</P>
      <P>"They turn up later in the statistics," Short claimed.</P>
      <P>Short said Beijing was impressed with a video-based adolescent
sex education program used in Australia and asked Australian experts
to provide advice on sex education programs.</P>

      <P>Premier Vincent Siew said Friday that the
United States has assured Taiwan that the summit talks between US
President Bill Clinton and mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin on
Oct. 28 will not damage Taiwan's interests.</P>
      <P>Siew said that Taiwan will closely monitor the Washington-Beijing
summit talks. The ROC representative to the United States, Jason Hu,
has expressed Taiwan's concern over the summit to the US government
and has obtained assurances that the talks will not affect Taiwan's
interests, he added.</P>
      <P>Answering questions from lawmakers at the Legislative Yuan, the
premier said that his remark earlier this week that "the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait could hold talks next spring" was "speculation"
based on the international situation and Beijing's recent remarks on
cross-strait ties.</P>
      <P>The bottom line for cross-strait negotiations lies in the
National Unification Guidelines, he said, noting that they specify
"freedom, democracy and an equitable distribution of wealth" as the
principles governing the reunification of the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>Siew stressed that he has ordered relevant government agencies to

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING'S YOUNGER LEADERS SET NEW TONE (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Oct.  3 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The close of the 15th National Congress
of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) saw the retirement from the
party's Central Committee of virtually all party veterans whose
political careers began before 1949, The Straits Times pointed out in
a commentary Friday.</P>
      <P>For the first time in the history of the CCP, the decision-making
body is composed of members who began their political careers shortly
before 1949.</P>
      <P>Such a development has great implications for mainland China, the
article said.</P>
      <P>The year 1949, when the Communists took control over mainland
China, is used as a benchmark to demarcate generations.
Revolutionaries like Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping are considered the
first generation. People like Jiang Zemin and Li Peng who joined the
party and public service around 1949 are the second generation, while
those born after 1949 are the third generation.</P>
      <P>Studies have found that those belonging to the second generation
shared common characteristics.</P>
      <P>They lacked the legendary revolutionary experiences and
monumental achievements of the first generation to back up their
claim to power.</P>
      <P>They also lacked both the charisma and force of character
characterizing the first generation.</P>
      <P>This group was, therefore, more inclined toward a power-sharing
arrangement within the ruling caucus.</P>
      <P>Although collective leadership was an ideal for first generation
leaders, it was never actually put into practice because of the
strong character of its members. With the second generation, it stood
a better chance of success.</P>
      <P>Working under the shadow of the first generation leaders meant
that second generation members had less room to innovate.</P>
      <P>It was not until after the collapse of the Soviet Union that they
were forced to take a more reformist line.</P>
      <P>Having had a university education, the second generation leaders
were also good technocrats.</P>
      <P>They were more rational, willing to listen to different points of
view and prepared to make greater use of think tanks in running the
economy.</P>
      <P>The results of the 15th party congress seem to confirm these
observations, The Straits Times said.</P>
      <P>The party congress showed an element of power-sharing, though not
at the highest level, it noted.</P>
      <P>The first sign of power-sharing was in 1995 when Jiang promoted
1,000 military officers to the rank of major-general and above in
exchange for their loyalty, the article said.</P>
      <P>At the 15th congress, the same strategy was adopted, though on a
smaller scale, it added, noting that the Central Committee
(comprising both full and alternate members) grew from 319 to 344
members, an increase of 7 percent.</P>
      <P>The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection also expanded
from 108 to 115 members, or 6 percent.</P>
      <P>At the next tier up, the number of Politburo members (including
alternate members) increased from 22 to 24, while the membership of
the Central Secretariat rose from five to seven.</P>
      <P>The two most powerful bodies -- the Standing Committee of the
Politburo and the Central Military Commission -- were untouched.

    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Oct.  3 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The daily said that the characteristics
of the second generation -- power sharing, adherence to the teachings
handed down from their party elders and a more technocratic approach
to running state affairs -- might be just what mainland China needs
to meet the challenges posed by the demise of strong-man politics
there.</P>
      <P>The retirement of party veterans from the Central Committee also
brought about the obliteration of the "princelings" -- the sons and
daughters of mainland China's rulers -- as a class, it said, noting
that in the mid-1980s, they were considered one of the main sources
of future leaders.</P>
      <P>Another development worth noting is the ascendancy of regional
forces, the article said.</P>
      <P>The phenomenal growth in influence of the "regional" seats in the
Central Committee is the direct result of the decentralization of
power that was part of Deng's reform program, it said.</P>
      <P>This increase in regional clout might pose problems for Beijing's
ruling elite, for there are signs that the regional bosses are
increasingly unwilling to toe Beijing's line, the daily noted.</P>
      <P>Another hypothesis that could explain the big increase in seats
for regional forces is again the power-sharing concept, it said,
noting that Jiang might want to broaden his power base by allotting
each province extra seats.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan on Friday experienced rare hot
trading of the US dollar on its foreign exchange market, with
transactions hitting US$1,539 million.</P>
      <P>Despite this, the value of the greenback remained unchanged at
NT$28.601, opening at the day's high of NT$28.602 and closing at
NT$28.601, also the day's low.</P>
      <P>Dealers attributed the increased transactions to several factors,
including remittances by the Foreign Affairs Ministry of US$100
million in aid and loans to friendly countries in Central and South
America, and payment of an undisclosed sum by the Defense Ministry
for foreign arms purchases, as well as the withdrawal of foreign
capital from the local stock market, which has lost its steam
recently.</P>
      <P>Economics officials said that the hot trading also signaled a
greenback-buying spree on the part of the private sector, taking
advantage of the fact that the US dollar is gaining strength in the
wake of the currency turmoil in several Southeast Asian countries.</P>
      <P>But they said that the booming US dollar trading is still
considered by the Central Bank of China (CBC) as being within
"tolerable" limits. One of the principal priorities of the CBC is to

    <HEADLINE>FOUR PILLARS OWNER INDICTED FOR THEFT OF TRADE SECRETS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.2  (CNA)
(By Herman Pan &amp; Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The owner of Taiwan-based Four Pillars
Enterprise and his daughter will go to trial in the United States
following a federal grand jury indictment on 21 charges related to
the theft of commercial secrets announced by the US Justice
Department on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Businessman Yang Pin-yen and his daughter Yang Hwei-chen were
arrested by US investigators Sept. 4 on charges of conspiracy, mail
and wire fraud, money laundering, possession of stolen goods and
theft of technological know-how from the Avery Dennison Corporation
of Pasadena, California. They were freed on bail 13 days later and
been subject to electronic monitoring since that time.</P>
      <P>With no significant deviations from the original charges, the
indictment alleges that Yang, 70, and his 39-year-old daughter, the
manager for research and development at Four Pillars, carried out the
scheme over nearly a decade, spanning from 1989 to 1997, with the
assistance of Lee Ten-hong, a Dennison employee.</P>
      <P>The Yangs' alleged theft of trade secrets would violate the 1996
Economic Espionage Act, the department said. Any violation of the law
carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison, along with a
US$500,000 fine.</P>
      <P>Yang Ping-yen's Cleveland-based lawyer Patrick McLaughlin told
CNA that the Yangs will plead not guilty to the charges against them
at their arraignment by the state of Ohio's North District Court next
week.</P>
      <P>According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Lee
confessed to his involvement in the crime last March, revealing that
he received between US$140,000 and US$150,000 from Four Pillars over
the eight-year period for providing the company with valuable
technical know-how owned by Dennison.</P>
      <P>In early June, Lee bargained with the FBI and prosecutors to face
a less severe charge of wire fraud in exchange for his full
cooperation in building a case against the Yangs and Four Pillars,
which produces and markets adhesive products in the US, Taiwan,
mainland China and Malaysia.</P>
      <P>Avery Dennison is listed as one of the largest manufacturers in
the US of self-adhesive products like postage stamps and tape for
disposable diapers, employing over 16,000 personnel worldwide.</P>
      <P>An estimate by the US Justice Department indicated that the value
of the trade secrets allegedly stolen by Four Pillars amounted to

    <HEADLINE>RUSSIAN ENVOY NOT OPTIMISTIC ABOUT TAIWAN RELATIONS ACT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 3 (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Russian envoy to Taiwan Victor Trifonov said
on Friday that he is pessimistic about the Russian parliament's
passage of a law regulating his country's relations with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Trifonov, chief of the Moscow-Taipei Economic and Cultural
Coordination Commission's Taipei office, was commenting on the
"Taiwan Relations Bill" recently initiated by a group of Russian
parliamentarians friendly to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the CNA, Trifonov would not speculate on how
many of Russia's more-than 400 parliamentarians would throw their
support behind the bill, but he said he personally considered it
"very difficult" for the Russian parliament, or Dumas, to pass the
law, modeled after the one passed by the US Congress following
Washington's switch of diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing
in 1979.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Relations Act has formed the basis for
Taipei-Washington exchanges in the absence of formal ties since then.</P>
      <P>He said the reason for his pessimism is that Russian President
Boris Yeltsin issued a decree in September, 1992, providing a
framework for exchanges between Moscow and Taipei and thus there is
no need for his country to enact a law to serve the same purpose.</P>
      <P>But he said chances would be much higher for the parliament to
enact laws and regulations on "substantial issues," such as the
promotion of investment and the avoidance of double taxation.</P>
      <P>Questioned about the presence of mainland Chinese embassy
officials at a Russian public hearing on the new law, where they
voiced their opposition, Trifonov said that whether Moscow needs such
a law is an internal issue and has nothing to do with its relations
with the mainland.</P>
      <P>With regard to exchanges of high-level visits between Taiwan and
Russia, Trifonov said that he believes exchanges of this nature will
gradually increase in the future.</P>

      <P>Premier Vincent Siew has achieved a nearly
70 percent approval rating for his performance since assuming the
position one month ago, according to the result of a survey made
public by the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) on Friday.</P>
      <P>The survey found that 15.65 percent of those interviewed think
Siew's performance has been "quite satisfactory" and 53.85 percent
described it as "satisfactory," while only 16.19 percent said that
they are dissatisfied with his performance.</P>
      <P>Some 24.06 percent of those polled chose "Siew's smile and his
friendly character" as the thing that has most impressed them since
Siew took office on Sept. 1. His decision to cancel preferential
traffic control for the premier's limousine during rush hours won
approval from 14.85 percent of the polled, followed by his "action
cabinet" slogan with 14.04 percent, the importance he attaches to
public opinion at 11.81 percent and his attempts to relax the
tensions between the central government and the provincial government
at 10.29 percent.</P>
      <P>Asked about the priorities of the tasks facing Siew, improving
social order was cited as the first priority by 58.68 percent of the
respondents, while expanding diplomatic frontiers only garnered 5.37
percent and improving cross-strait relations was considered a
priority by a tiny 1.88 percent.</P>
      <P>Strengthening trade and economic development came as the second
priority at 11 percent, followed by improving social welfare at 9.03

    <HEADLINE>CHIANG CHING-KUO WAS GIMO'S NATURAL SON: MAINLAND BOOK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  3  (CNA)
(By H.C.M.)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A report that the late President Chiang
Ching-kuo of the Republic of China was not the natural son of
Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek has come as a shock to the people of
Taiwan and has become the hottest topic of the day.</P>
      <P>The Taipei-based Business Weekly magazine said in its current
issue that the report was based on information from Chiang Kai-shek's
second son, the late General Chiang Wego, who died last month aged
81. Wego, who was actually Chiang's adopted son, said before his
death that his brother Ching-kuo was also adopted.</P>
      <P>Both Chiang Kai-shek (1887-1975) and Chiang Ching-kuo served as
president of the Republic of China. A very important figure in modern
China, Chiang Kai-shek served as president from 1948 to 1949 and
after a brief retirement, from 1950 until his death in 1975. Chiang
Ching-kuo (1910-1988) was president from 1978 to 1988.</P>
      <P>The Business Weekly said that it got its information from
Professor Fan Kuang-ling who teaches at Taiwan's Chung Hsing
University. A good friend of Wego, Fan conducted a series of
interviews with him over the past few years. At one of these
interviews in 1994, Wego told Fan that his brother Ching-kuo, like
him, was not the natural son of the generalissimo.</P>
      <P>In an accompanying article in the magazine, Fan said he believes
Wego was telling the truth because he talked with great calm and
sincerity. He also said that all the interviews were recorded on
tape.</P>
      <P>However, a book entitled "Chiang Kai-shek's Family, published in
mainland China, said Chiang Ching-kuo was indeed the natural child of
Chiang Kai-shek and his first wife Mao Fu-mei.</P>
      <P>The book's author reportedly consulted many documents and books
in mainland China, Taiwan, Japan and the United States and the book
was approved by the United Front Department of the Chinese Communist
Party Central Committee before its publication.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, another mainland book, "Mao Fu-mei, Chiang Kai-shek
and Chiang Ching-kuo," said Chiang Kai-shek and Chiang Ching-kuo are
natural father and son. It said that during the summer of 1909,
Chiang came back for summer vacation from Japan, where he was
attending a military academy. He and his wife spent a couple of
months together in Shanghai before he returned to Japan.</P>
      <P>It was during this period that Fu-mei became pregnant and their
son Ching-kuo was born the following year.</P>
      <P>The new report has caused great concern among the people of
Taiwan. Some say the truth should come out, but most doubt the
authenticity of the report. Many say that the Chiangs made such great
contributions to the development of the Republic of China that
reports such as this should be treated with care. "We will not
believe it until there is enough evidence to prove it," one historian
stressed, adding that as all three Chiangs are now dead, it will be
almost impossible to confirm the report.</P>

      <P>Taiwan and Singapore will hold a new round
of World Trade Organization (WTO) talks on Taiwan's terms for entry
into the world trade regulatory body, Chen Ruey-long, director
general of the Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT), said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the talks will be held when representatives from
both nations attend the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
forum's Special Senior Official Meeting in Singapore, scheduled for
Oct. 27-28.</P>
      <P>Chen said Singapore is expected to present a list of 40
industrial items, including petrochemical, electric and electronics
products upon which the city-state hopes that Taiwan will cut
tariffs.</P>
      <P>High on the agenda of the talks will be Singapore's request for
Taiwan to open maritime auxiliary services, including maritime cargo
handling services, storage and warehousing services in ports,
maritime agency services, maritime freight forwarding services and
container station and depot services.</P>
      <P>Chen said that during ministerial-level WTO talks last year,
Taiwan and Singapore reached a preliminary agreement to complete the
maritime services talks before 2000. But as a global
framework has yet to be completed, it is doubtful that
Taiwan will make any promises in this regard in the absence of such a
framework, he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan's latest week-long round of WTO talks with the
United States will be held in Taipei from Oct. 16, when both sides

    <HEADLINE>BLACK-WHITE IQ GAP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  Oct.  3  (CNA)
(By David Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>White students tend to outscore black
students by as many as 15 IQ points during their senior years in high
school, but blacks effectively cut their IQ gap with whites in half
by graduation from college.</P>
      <P>This is one of the key findings of a new study from Washington
University in St. Louis that holds important implications for the
current debate over federal and state attempts to rollback
affirmative action programs.</P>
      <P>"Our study shows that differences in IQ test scores among blacks
and whites may have little to do with genetics and much to do with
the relative quality of the educational opportunities afforded to
blacks and whites," said Mark R. Rank, an associate professor at the
university's George Warren Brown School of Social Work.</P>
      <P>The study also blasts holes in several controversial theories put
forth by The Bell Curve, a 1994 book by conservative social theorists
Charles Murray and the late Richard Herrnstein. The book and its
theories on race-based intelligence are credited by some with fueling
the attack on affirmative action.</P>
      <P>"The message for the affirmative action debate is that black
students who finish college appear to make dramatic gains in
cognitive abilities," said Joel Myerson, research instructor in the
School of Medicine's Health Administration Program and a member of
the Washington University research team. "White students also improve
during college, but to a lesser extent."</P>
      <P>"The more important point," Myerson added," is that the level of
ability black students exhibit at the end of college would have been
greatly underestimated based on how they tested when they took
college entrance exams in high school. For at least some black high
school students, the SAT and other common college entrance exams may
not provide an accurate picture of their potential."</P>
      <P>The findings have implications for debates now raging over the
use of racial preferences in affirmative action programs, including
California's controversial Proposition 209. Effective last September,
Prop. 209 makes it illegal to use race as a factor in awarding
government contracts, scholarships and other perquisites commonly
included in affirmative action programs.</P>
      <P>The Washington University study provides ammunition for those
seeking to maintain some form of racial preferences by offering
evidence that some blacks are indeed more qualified than their test
scores indicate. The test scores of some whites also may not reflect
their true potential, but this research suggests that scores that
underestimate future performance may be more common among blacks.</P>

      <P>The Asia-Pacific semiconductor
market, excluding Japan, recorded August sales of US$2.576 billion,
an 18.5 percent sales increase compared to the same period of last
year, said the Semiconductor Industry Association's (SIA) monthly
Global Sales Report released on Friday.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, the American market is still dominant and the
fastest-growing in the world, with total sales of US$3.858 billion,
which helped push global semiconductor sales in August 1997 to
US$11.6 billion, a 15.3 percent increase over sales recorded in
August 1996.</P>
      <P>"This marks the fourth straight month of strong year-to-year
growth for the semiconductor industry," said SIA President George
Scalise. "Despite some seasonal sluggishness in the European and
Japanese markets, all indicators suggest the global industry is
growing as we start the fourth quarter."</P>
      <P>The global sales data, compiled by the World Semiconductor Trade
Statistics Organization, shows that August's sales were nearly
identical to July 1997 sales in all four major chip markets, the
Americas, Europe, Japan and the Asia-Pacific. "This is particularly
good news because sales stayed strong during the peak summer vacation
season," Scalise said.</P>
      <P>On a month-to-month basis, the Asia-Pacific region had the best
performance in August, with a 1.8 percent growth from the previous
month, while the Americas market rose 0.4 percent. In Europe and
Japan, where August sales traditionally decrease, sales declined by 1
percent and 1.3 percent respectively.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN WORKERS MORE COMPETITIVE: CLA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 4 (CNA)
(By Debbie Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Workers in Taiwan's manufacturing sector are
more competitive than their counterparts from other major APEC
economies in terms of wages and pay increase rates, the Council of
Labor Affairs (CLA) reported on Saturday.</P>
      <P>In a recent survey of nominal wages and pay increase rates among
manufacturing workers in Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Hong
Kong and the United States, the council found that among laborers in
Taiwan's manufacturing sector, monthly nominal wages, averaging
US$1,225 in 1995, were the second-lowest among the six major APEC
economies, ahead only of Hong Kong's US$1,090.</P>
      <P>By comparison, average monthly nominal wages in South Korea were
US$1,457, US$1,522 in Singapore, US$4,153 in Japan and US$2,230 in
the United States.</P>
      <P>In terms of pay increase rates, Taiwan posted the lowest among
four "Asian Dragons" during the period of 1991-1995, the officials
said.</P>
      <P>Average salaries increased 8.35 percent during the five-year
period, as compared with 9.29 percent in Hong Kong, 11.79 percent in
South Korea and 14.61 percent in Singapore.</P>
      <P>CLA officials pointed out that Taiwan's relatively low nominal
wages and slower pay increase rates were key factors in making the
island's manufacturing sector more competitive than those of other
major APEC economies.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan's average annual working hours totaled 2,418 in
1995, down five hours from 1991's 2,423 hours. The 1995 figure was
lower than those posted in Singapore and South Korea, but much higher
than those in Hong Kong, Japan and the United States, the officials
noted.</P>

Oct. 10, hence the name.</P>
      <P>The nine-page supplement will introduce the latest political and
economic developments in the ROC in recent years.</P>
      <P>In a preface to the supplement, ROC President Lee Teng-hui writes
that the ROC remains dedicated to building upon Taiwan's economic and
political achievements of recent decades to assure its survival and
sustainable growth well into the 21st century.</P>
      <P>As the new millennium approaches, exciting changes in the
economic and political landscape of Taiwan hold the promise of even
more astonishing successes in the years to come, Lee said, pointing
out that the government and private sectors are increasingly working
hand-in-hand to turn Taiwan into a hub of activity for the
Asia-Pacific region, with the intention of attracting more foreign
investment.</P>
      <P>Noting that sustainable economic development over the long term
will require a healthy democratic political climate, Lee said the
recent round of constitutional revisions has provided the proper
system of checks and balances to ensure that the executive and
legislative branches of government can work productively to forge the
national policies needed for the new century.</P>
      <P>The supplement, headlined "Taiwan: on the Global Fast Track,"
tells of the booming ROC economy, describing it as the world's
19th-largest economy and the 14th-largest trading nation.</P>
      <P>The article said that in just a few years, the island has boldly
transformed itself from a society ruled by martial law into a
near-full-fledged democracy.</P>
      <P>The article cited the words of David Tawei Lee, director general
of the ROC Government Information Office, who said: "The blossoming
of democracy in Taiwan represents a political miracle rivaling the
success of Taiwan's economic development."</P>
      <P>Lee also noted the advantages of investing in Taiwan and urged US
hi-tech and aviation companies to invest in his country. The article
also explains in detail Taiwan-US trade relations, US investment in
Taiwan and the nation's flagship Hsinchu Science-based Industrial
Park.</P>

      <P>Two more nations expressed their support
for the Republic of China's efforts to rejoin the United Nations,
calling Friday for the UN to abide by the principles and purposes of
its charter.</P>
      <P>Foreign Minister of the Solomon Islands Pattefon Oti said in his

      <P>Later that day, Foreign Minister Fayez Zawarneh of Jordan called
for UN membership for all peace-loving states in accordance with
Article IV (1) of the charter, in order to achieve the universality

      <P>Oti also mentioned the peaceful reunification of China, affirming
that the participation of the ROC in the UN would greatly assist in
successful negotiations on the matter.</P>
      <P>Bringing about and successfully completing these negotiations
will be a long and difficult process that would be greatly helped by
the participation of the ROC in the UN, he claimed.</P>
      <P>He also condemned Beijing for threatening his country and other
states that have spoken on behalf of the ROC.</P>
      <P>"Regrettably, threats have been made and actions taken against

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA SUFFERS DROP IN TOURISTS FROM TAIWAN (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct.  4  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Hit hard by racial debates, increasing
competition and strict entry requirements, Australia has suffered its
first setback in luring more tourists from Taiwan since Canberra
opened air links with Taipei in 1991, travel agents and officials
said.</P>
      <P>Between July 1, 1996 and June 30, 1997, the number of Taiwanese
tourists to Australia dropped 3.6 percent to 152,366 from the
previous year, according to the Australian Tourist Commission (ATC).</P>
      <P>"This is the first drop Australia has ever experienced since it
opened air links with Taiwan to lure Taiwanese tourists to the Down
Under," Joseph Hunghai Ru, director of the Sydney office of the
Taiwan Visitors Association, said in an interview with CNA.</P>
      <P>He said Australia failed to attract tourists from Taiwan because
of a number of factors, including the need for a visa, keener
competition from the United States and Europe, more expensive travel
packages and, above all, the racial debate triggered by Independent
Member of Parliament Pauline Hanson.</P>
      <P>The previous Labor Party government decided to waive visa
requirements for Taiwanese tourists this year, but the change of the
government in March 1996 has delayed the process.</P>
      <P>The government of the Republic of China, however, waived visa
requirements for Australian citizens several years ago.</P>
      <P>This lack of reciprocity has annoyed many Taiwanese tourists.
Many countries, including the United States and some in Europe, have
eased travel restrictions for Taiwanese visitors, travel agents said.</P>
      <P>They said the visa requirement causes delays and inconvenience
for organizing group tours from Taiwan to Australia.</P>
      <P>Traveling to Australia is more expensive than to other countries
a similar distance away, and the United States is trying very hard to
lower air fares and accommodation rates to attract more tourists from
Taiwan and other Asian countries, the agents said.</P>
      <P>A new survey, commissioned by the Tourism Council of Australia
(TCA) and conducted by the University of Western Sydney and Anderson
Consulting, found that Australia is one of the most expensive tourist
destinations.</P>
      <P>The racial debate here since late 1996 has also made things worse
for Australia as more and more tourists from Taiwan and other Asian
countries believe going to the Down Under might no longer be safe or
enjoyable.</P>
      <P>Ru said Taiwan is a leading tourist market for many countries
because at least five million Taiwanese travel abroad every year. And
Taiwanese visitors are known as big spenders in many countries.

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA SUFFERS DROP IN TOURISTS FROM TAIWAN (II)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct.  4  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Travel agents blamed the decline of Taiwanese visitors on
unfavorable conditions in Australia and they warned Australia could
lose still more Asian visitors.</P>
      <P>Tourism contributes more than a million jobs and earns more than
10 percent of Australia's gross domestic product, according to the
two surveys by the Bureau of Tourism in Australia.</P>
      <P>TCA managing director Bruce Baird, who opened the Australian
Tourism Conference in Sydney on Friday, said Australian tourism
accounted for one in nine jobs and had a turnover of more than US$36
billion.</P>
      <P>Federal Tourism Minister John Moore told the Sydney conference:
"In many of our markets, Australia is constantly nominated as the
preferred destination, but only a small percentage of these potential
tourists actually visit here. The challenge which clearly confronts
us is to convert these preferences into actual visits."</P>
      <P>Soon after Australia opened air links with Taiwan in late 1991
with the aim of boosting tourism and bilateral trade, the number of
Taiwanese visitors surged from about 35,000 a year to 63,500 in 1992.
Tourism from Taiwan became Australia's fastest growing tourist
market.</P>
      <P>But the situation has changed.</P>
      <P>Between July 1996 and June 1997, the only negative growth in
tourism Australia suffered came from Taiwan. But Australia also had
markedly reduced growth in the number of tourists from major markets
such as Korea, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and
Thailand, travel agents said.</P>
      <P>"This is an alarm bell for Australia because the tourism industry
is one of the top foreign exchange earners for this country," one
agent commented.</P>
      <P>Overall, between July 1996 and June 1997, Australia attracted
more than 4.25 million foreign tourists, up 7.2 percent from the
previous year.</P>
      <P>This increase, however, is less than agents have hoped for in
advance of the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, one agent noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SINGTEL  TAKES FCC TO COURT OVER RATE-CUT MOVE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Oct. 4 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore Telecommunications Corporation
(SingTel) has taken court action to overturn the United States
Federal Communications Commission (FCC)'s one-sided decision to cut
international settlement rates on overseas calls.</P>
      <P>SingTel said on Saturday it filed a lawsuit two days ago at the
US Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia, claiming the FCC
order was "outside its lawful jurisdiction and that it was arbitrary
due to the unilateral setting of benchmark levels, in spite of a lack
of cost data."</P>
      <P>The corporation said it hoped the FCC's order to slash rates
could be "invalidated" so that all carriers could work jointly to
achieve an amicable solution towards global reform of accounting
rates.</P>
      <P>Settlement rates are the amounts phone companies charge each
other to complete the connection of international calls and SingTel's
petition followed similar action by other regional telecommunications
operators.</P>
      <P>On August 28, the FCC said it would proceed with plans to cut the
rates by up to 70 percent from January next year, setting new, lower
benchmarks for international settlement rates in an effort to reduce
a US$5.4 billion payment deficit by US telephone companies to foreign
carriers.</P>
      <P>The move places a ceiling on the settlement rates US-based
carriers have to pay their foreign counterparts.</P>
      <P>The FCC has categorized Singapore and other developed countries
and areas like Japan and Hong Kong as high-income nations -- a
decision which would reduce drastically the settlement fees paid to
their phone companies, cutting the 42 US cents per minute SingTel
currently receives for completing calls to just 15 US cents.</P>
      <P>SingTel said it does not agree with such unilateral action and
believes that global reform of settlement rates should be carried out
on a multilateral basis, in an international forum such as the
International Telecommunication Union (ITU).</P>
      <P>The ITU, a Geneva-based arm of the United Nations, regulates the
worldwide telecommunications market.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Finance (MOF) on Saturday
announced that the current 7 percent daily rise-fall cap on
individual stocks' values on the Taiwan Stock Exchange will remain in
order to help keep trading stable.</P>
      <P>The Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD),
Taiwan's top economic planning agency, proposed in July to remove the
eight-year-old limitation in line with the island's financial
liberalization.</P>
      <P>After the MOF questioned the proposal, however, the Executive
Yuan asked the ministry to investigate its feasibility and to report
the results of the study in three weeks.</P>
      <P>At an unscheduled press conference Saturday, MOF Vice Minister
Yen Ching-chang officially announced the ministry's decision to
preserve the rule, stressing that a stably developing stock market is
more important at the present than dropping the cap.</P>
      <P>Currently, over 90 percent of total turnover in the local bourse
comes from individual investors. Because of this, Yen said, trading
on the market is easily swayed by rumors and the speculation of
investors.</P>

      <P>He likes to ride his 150cc motorcycle on
deserted roads deep into the mountains of Hsinchu County to visit his
aboriginal friends and share Maiyouji (chicken stewed in rice wine
and sesame oil) with them.</P>
      <P>People might guess that Olivier Lardinois, a handsome, 183cm-tall
young Belgian, who also enjoys stopping off at roadside foodstands in
downtown Hsinchu to eat fried "stinky" tofu, is a traveler rather
than a Catholic curate.</P>
      <P>Lardinois was ordained into the priesthood on Saturday during an
ordination ceremony presided over by Most Reverend Luke Liu, DD, of
the Bishop's Office of Hsinchu Diocese, officially kicking off his
career as a father in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The 33-year-old, with a masters degree in history from Belgium's
University of Louvain, first came to Taiwan seven years ago to study
Mandarin Chinese and work at the Catholic Huakuang Development Center
in Hsinchu City.</P>
      <P>After five years of clergy work in Hsinchu's mountainous areas of
Wufeng, Chienshih and Chutung, inhabited mainly by aboriginal Atayal
tribespeople, Lardinois decided to devote the rest of his life to the
Catholic church in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Asked once whether he doesn't think it a waste of time for him to
spend so much of his life in the backwater mountain districts, he
replied that not only does he enjoy being a "mountain man," he also
considers his having the opportunity to preach in the mountains as
"blessed."</P>
      <P>Like most ordinary men, Lardinois has dreamed of having his own
family and raising several children. But that dream is now definitely
gone because of his choice to enter the priesthood. Lardinois said he
has no regrets about this, saying that he will have thousands of
brothers, sisters, mothers and children now that he has become a
father.</P>
      <P>Lardinois, who also enjoys strolling through night markets to see
the many and varied faces of the local people, said he has found the
people of Taiwan to be energetic and full of passion, although he
lamented that they don't seem to pay much attention to their
environment. He expressed the hope that the people of Taiwan will
learn to love mother nature more so that Taiwan will remain "Ilha
Formosa" -- the beautiful island -- forever.</P>

(By Lawrence Chu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>At a ceremony in Taipei on Friday, National
Taiwan University (NTU) unveiled a new collection of materials
related to the history of Taiwan, including the island's indigenous
tribes.</P>
      <P>The new materials, both pictures and text, have been digitized
and are accessible on the World Wide Web.</P>
      <P>At the ceremony, Kao Cheng-shang, head of the Taipei City
Government's Aboriginal Affairs Office, told participants the new
collection would help dispel the long-standing myth that Taiwan's
history only began some 400 years ago when Han Chinese began to
settle on the island.</P>
      <P>The materials contain a great deal of valuable information on
Taiwan's aboriginal tribes, who had been living on the island long
before the Han arrived, he said.</P>
      <P>Professor Wu Mi-tsung of NTU's department of history said the
recorded historical materials gathered under the project had provided
little information about Taiwan before settlers started arriving 400
years ago.</P>
      <P>But information obtained through archaeological studies and
ethnologists have shed light on the island's aboriginal history, he
said.</P>
      <P>Discussing the progress that had been made by anthropologists and
archaeologists in recent years. Hsieh Hsu-chang,chair of the
university's anthropology department, said preliminary research on
some 1,500 graves recently discovered in eastern Taiwan's Taitung
County indicates they may date back 5,500 years.</P>
      <P>Many other sites being examined around the island appear to be
around 2,500 years old, he added.</P>
      <P>Based on scientific research, he said, aboriginal culture
probably didn't appear on Taiwan earlier than the New Stone Age. But
he added that the existence of an earlier culture still could not be
ruled out.</P>
      <P>The collecting and digitizing of historical materials on Taiwan
is the first stage of the university's efforts to build a large
electronic database, NTU President Chen Wei-chao said.</P>
      <P>The database project calls for materials to be collected covering
such disciplines as history, library science, anthropology, computer
science and electrical engineering.</P>
      <P>Chen said scanning and electronically storing the historical
materials would preserve them for future generations.</P>
      <P>Information on the history of the aborigines that inhabited
Taiwan's plains regions is already available on the Internet, he
said.</P>
      <P>The information can be found on the World Wide Web at
http://ntudlm.csie.ntu.edu.tw/. The website is currently only in
Chinese.</P>
      <P>The university is hoping that the database will provide everyone
interested with an unparalleled learning environment for the study of
Taiwan's history.</P>
      <P>University officials also said that the database is being
constructed in full conformity with the standards of international
museums and research institutions.</P>
      <P>The project is the only one of its kind in Asia to form
cooperative links with the Museum Information Exchange Association, a
worldwide organization, they said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JIANG  HOPES US MEET WILL OPEN NEW ERA IN BILATERAL RELATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  4  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin's
first state visit to Washington will take place in late October and
Jiang hopes the trip will open a new era in bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>The visit will take place against the background of improved
relations between Beijing and Washington and Jiang's confirmation as
leader at the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China
(CPC), of which Jiang is also general secretary.</P>
      <P>Jiang assumed the post of CPC General Secretary after the
Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989, which means he well-knows the
pressure of public opinion from the international community.</P>
      <P>After assuming the presidency of mainland China in 1993, Jiang
was active in foreign affairs, particularly with Washington, and was
heavily influenced by Deng Xiaoping, the old guard of the second
generation mainland leadership, who also had a keen interest in US
relations, realizing as he did that reform in mainland China would
depend on the country's integration into the world community.</P>
      <P>When Jiang met with US President Bill Clinton for the second time
in Seattle in 1994, he made it clear that Beijing's standpoint toward
Washington is "increasing confidence, decreasing trouble, developing
cooperation and having no confrontation." It is Jiang's hope that he
will be able to confirm the following five principles of their
bilateral relationship:</P>
      <P>-- Handle relations between Beijing and Washington with an eye to
world trends and the 21st century;</P>
      <P>-- Get rid of the differences in social systems and ideologies
between the two sides and tackle all the problems with goodwill;</P>
      <P>-- Take advantage of one another's characteristics and promote
all-round economic cooperation based on equality and mutual benefit;</P>
      <P>-- Cooperate in preventing arms proliferation, promoting
environmental conservation, cracking down on drugs and terrorism;</P>
      <P>-- Enhance mutual visits and high-level contacts.</P>
      <P>Last March, with relations between Beijing and Washington thawing
gradually, Jiang told Al Gore, US vice president and highest-ranking
US leader to visit Beijing after Deng's death and the Tiananmen
massacre, that in order to enter into the next century with a sound
and stable peace, there are three principles which should be adhered
to firmly -- consistently adhering to the principle of mutual
interests, standing higher and viewing farther, and acting in
accordance with the three joint communiques in handling the Taiwan
problem properly.</P>
      <P>Jiang's interpretation of the above principles is worthy of much
attention. For the first principle, Jiang this time stressed "mutual
interests" instead of "common enemy," as he has done in the past. The
second principle sounds rather empty, but what it really means is
that Beijing must stick to its policy of reform and opening-up. The
third principle is of most significance to Taipei as it emphasizes
not letting the Taiwan problem affect the progress of Sino-US
bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>It seems that Jiang's three principles have received a positive
response from Washington, which is probably why Jiang used the
Chinese idiom "the sky clears up after long rain" to depict bilateral
relations when he met with House Speaker Newt Gingrich two days after
the meeting with Gore.</P>
      <P>Viewed with hindsight, Deng's five principles of 1994 can be seen
as a fledgling form of Jiang's pattern, while the present three
principles represent the complete emergence of Jiang's own
philosophy.</P>
      <P>Jiang is talking about the three principles prior to the meeting
with US President Bill Clinton, indicating that he is hoping they
will be accepted by Washington and merged into the bilateral
relationship.</P>
      <P>According to informed sources, although a fourth communique is
not likely to be signed during Jiang's visit, it is still Beijing's
yearning that Clinton and Jiang will present a common stance to the
world, which will lead to a new era with mutual interests as the
basis.</P>

forest fires in Indonesia, said an official with Singapore's Ministry
of the Environment.</P>
      <P>In the next six weeks, there is a "slim chance" -- less than 10
percent -- that the daily PSI (Pollutants Standard Index) readings in
Singapore will go into the "very unhealthy range" of over 200, he
predicted.</P>
      <P>Since the Environment Ministry started providing daily PSI
readings in August, haze levels over Singapore have hovered in the
moderate to unhealthy range below 200. The highest 24-hour reading so
far is 138.</P>
      <P>The official said that the severity of the haze here depends
mainly on the direction of the wind and how close the fires are to
Singapore.</P>
      <P>The haze, an annual phenomenon, is particularly bad this year
because more land in neighboring Indonesia is on fire and the very
dry weather has exacerbated the conditions, he noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN INVESTMENT IN MALAYSIA UNAFFECTED BY FINANCIAL CRISIS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kuala  Lumpur,  Oct.  5  (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite the slip in the Malaysian
ringgit against the US dollar, Taiwan's investment and trade
relations with Malaysia have not been affected, a Taipei official
stationed here said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Paul Tso, representative of the Taipei Economic and Cultural
Office in Malaysia, said that Taiwan businessmen had launched 31
investment projects worth some US$91.35 million in Malaysia during
the first seventh months of the year.</P>
      <P>"In terms of accumulated investment value in Malaysia, Taiwan is
the second-largest foreign investor, second only to Japan," Tso said
while attending the opening ceremony of the annual meeting of the
Taiwan Businessmen Association in Malaysia.</P>
      <P>In his first public speech since assuming the position on Sept.
17, Tso expressed optimism over the Malaysian economy, saying that
Malaysia's economic structure is quite stable and that the government
has the ability to take effective remedial measures. Malaysia can
soon overcome the financial crisis which has plagued the countries of
Southeast Asia for months, he added.</P>
      <P>"Trade ties between Taiwan and Malaysia are progressing," Tso
said, adding that the two-way trade volume reached US$3.25 billion
between January and July, up 11.72 percent from the same period of
last year. Malaysia exported goods worth US$1.59 billion to Taiwan,
and imported goods valued at US$1.66 billion from Taiwan, Tso said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan remains Malaysia's fourth-largest trading partner, while
Malaysia is Taiwan's seventh-largest trading partner. The current
financial crisis does not affect Taiwan's trade and investment
relations with Malaysia, Tso said.</P>
      <P>The Malaysian ringgit has eroded more than 30 percent against the
US dollar since July, while the stock market has lost about one-third
in capitalization, amid a spate of turmoil involving regional
currencies set off by the devaluation of the Thai baht. The Malaysian
ringgit closed at a rate of 3.3825 to one US dollar on Friday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT TALKS MAY RESUME BY YEAR'S END</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  5  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The two sides of the Taiwan Strait may
resume consultations by the end of this year, a local mainland China
affairs expert said on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Pan Hsi-tang, a Tamkang University professor, made the forecast
at a seminar on prospects for cross-strait political talks.</P>
      <P>Pan said Taipei and Beijing have offered olive branches to each
other in recent days in an attempt to create a friendly atmosphere in
preparation for resumption of stalled bilateral talks.</P>
      <P>Those moves are also intended to feel out each other's terms for
the resumption of dialogue, Pan noted.</P>
      <P>Although many observers have predicted that cross-strait talks
will not resume until next spring, Pan said he does not rule out the
possibility that the two sides could return to the negotiation table
late this year.</P>
      <P>Pan said if the outcome of the upcoming summit meeting between US
President Bill Clinton and mainland President Jiang Zemin meet
Beijing's expectations and if the pro-independence Democratic
Progressive Party wins in Taiwan's year-end mayoral and county
magistrate elections, the mainland leadership is very likely to
reopen talks with Taiwan before year's end with a view to "stemming
the island's independence movement and promoting China's
reunification."</P>
      <P>Pan further predicted that future cross-strait talks will focus
on political issues instead of nonpolitical technical issues and that
the level of participating officials will be higher than in the past.</P>
      <P>Professor Hsu Yu of the military-run Fuhsingkang College,
however, disagreed with Pan's viewpoints, saying that next spring is
the earliest possible juncture for the resumption of cross-strait
talks.</P>
      <P>Hsu said ROC President Lee Teng-hui is expected to speak on
cross-strait issues in his New Year's message while mainland
President Jiang will also air his views on the same topic in his
message to be released on the eve of Chinese lunar new year.</P>
      <P>"Only after the top leaders of the two sides have expressed their
opinions about the agenda can cross-strait consultations resume," Hsu
asserted.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Ma Chi-hua, a National Chengchi
University professor, said that for both Taipei and Beijing,
negotiation is not a choice, but a necessity.</P>
      <P>"Beijing would like to maintain a comparative state of peace in
the Taiwan Strait because it is afraid that a cross-strait military
confrontation would affect its economic development and the
implementation of its `one country, two systems' formula in Hong Kong
and Macau," Ma analyzed.</P>
      <P>Against this background, Ma said, Beijing would desire a
resumption of talks with Taiwan to reach an agreement on certain
controversial issues. "Mainland China's stance is to prepare for war
while seeking peace. As for Taiwan, its stance is the avoidance of
war through negotiation," Ma said.</P>
      <P>Touching on possible developments in future cross-strait
political talks, Professor Liang Chung-ming of Nan Hua Management
College, said Taipei and Beijing will continue to express their own
opinions in the short term.</P>
      <P>They are expected to remove any preconditions for talks in the
medium term, Liang said, adding that over the long run, discussion
will focus on constitutional amendments on each side and that both
sides will mull the possibility of legislating a "China Basic Law" to
regulate relations among the Chinese mainland, Taiwan, Hong Kong and
Macau.</P>
      <P>Some scholars also suggested at the seminar that academics from
both sides of the strait meet to discuss some controversial issues,
such as the "one China" police, before cross-strait dialogue is
formally resumed. Academic discussion on those issues will certainly
helpful to future cross-strait talks, they claimed.</P>
      <P>Beijing unilaterally suspended semi-official cross-strait
dialogue after President Lee made a landmark visit to the United
States in June 1995, which Beijing interpreted as a veiled move to
promote Taiwan independence.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Police raided a New Taiwan Dollar coin
counterfeiting facility in Taichung, central Taiwan, on Sunday and
arrested two suspects in the case.</P>
      <P>Also confiscated in the sweep were nearly 30,000 bogus NT$10 and
NT$50 coins as well as a batch of tools and machinery used for
producing fake coins.</P>
      <P>Police officers had arrested Chu Chi-chin, 47, in the southern
port city of Kaohsiung late Saturday and seized 6,796 counterfeit
NT$50 coins, with a face value of NT$339,800, at Chu's home.</P>
      <P>Chu told police that the fake coins were purchased from a
woman living in Taichung.</P>
      <P>Acting on tips provided by Chu, police managed to arrest the
woman, identified as Huang Chen-tsai, in a pre-dawn raid on her home.</P>
      <P>In the basement of Huang's residence, officers uncovered 906
counterfeit new-version NT$50 coins and 22,000 bogus NT$10 coins, in
addition to some semifinished counterfeit products, raw materials and
machinery.</P>
      <P>Huang, 50, told police that her son, Huang Li-wei, began to
counterfeit NT$10 and NT$50 coins in late August as he had lost a
large sum of money in a failed investment project.</P>
      <P>Huang Li-wei, 23, managed to flee before police arrived at his
home and remains at large.</P>
      <P>Initial investigations show that a large number of bogus NT$10
and NT$50 coins, with a face value of about NT$4 million, has already
flowed into the domestic market.</P>
      <P>Huang said the fake coins were sold to unknown persons, including
street vendors and vegetable retailers.</P>
      <P>Police said the counterfeit coins were thinner and darker in
color than the genuine versions. However, they said, the bogus coins
appear very similar to the authentic ones, adding that local
residents should pay close attention to the quality of coins they
receive.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>About 80,000 people, including Buddhist
followers, senior government officials and foreign dignitaries,
joined in a giant rally in downtown Taipei on Sunday dedicated to
spiritual renewal.</P>
      <P>The introspective rally at the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall
complex was part of a program organized by the Republic of China
chapter of the International Buddha Light Association founded by
Buddhist Master Hsin Yun.</P>
      <P>The program, launched in May, is aimed at stemming moral decline
and promoting compassion and love.</P>
      <P>Addressing the rally, Master Hsin Yun, who is also founder of the
Fokuangshan Buddhist Temple in southern Taiwan, said the rally marked
the beginning of a nationwide program for spiritual revitalization.</P>
      <P>"The soul-searching exercise requires the participation of all of
our people, not just Buddhist followers," Hsin Yun said, adding that
he hopes the program will even be promoted overseas.</P>
      <P>Hsin Yun further explained that the program is aimed mainly at
reminding individuals to cultivate compassion and love. "What Taiwan
badly needs today is not money or skyscrapers, but compassion and a
loving heart."</P>
      <P>Vice President Lien Chan and Premier Vincent Siew also spoke on
the occasion, encouraging every local resident to be a benevolent,
loving person. "Let us try our best to give others confidence,
convenience and happiness," Lien urged in his speech.</P>
      <P>Foreign ambassadors and unofficial envoys stationed in Taipei,
including those from Panama, Spain, Turkey, India, Indonesia and
Papua New Guinea, also joined in the rally to throw their support
behind the spiritual renewal program.</P>
      <P>Addressing the crowd, Panamanian Ambassador Carlos A. Mendoza
said he hopes the program will be continued in Taiwan and perhaps
even eventually spread to his homeland.</P>
      <P>During the rally, Master Hsin Yun presented a US$20,000 check to
the Papua New Guinea trade representative in Taiwan to help relieve
flood victims in the South Pacific island nation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JOHN CHANG SCOFFS AT RUMORS REGARDING FAMILY HISTORY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 5 (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Premier and Foreign Minister John Chang
on Sunday broke days of silence when he commented on recent reports
that late President Chiang Ching-kuo was not the natural son of
Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, saying that he "laughed away" such
rumors.</P>
      <P>"A learned man should be thoughtful of others. What he said or
what he did should not hurt the deceased or the living," said Chang,
who along with his deceased twin brother Winston Chang is an
illegitimate son of Chiang Ching-kuo. He was referring to comments
made by a professor regarding the Chiang family history which have
sparked heated discussion around Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Based on information provided by Professor Fan Kuang-ling, the
Taipei-based Business Weekly magazine reported in its latest issue
that Chiang Kai-shek had been deprived of the ability to produce
offspring because of an accident in his early childhood. The
professor also said that Chiang Ching-kuo was not the natural son of
Chiang Kai-shek and his first wife Mao Fu-mei.</P>
      <P>The magazine said that Fan Kuang-ling was a good friend of Wego
Chiang, Chiang Kai-shek's adopted son who passed away recently, and
that Fan had conducted a series of taped interviews with Wego over
the past few years. At one of these sessions in 1994, Wego told him
that his brother Ching-kuo, like himself, was not the natural son of
the generalissimo, Fan was quoted as saying in the magazine.</P>
      <P>But in a press conference held Saturday by the publisher of the
Business Weekly, Chin Wei-chun, among the eight interview tapes made
public by Fan, the part regarding Chiang Kai-shek's childhood
accident was related by Fan himself instead of Wego Chiang.</P>
      <P>Fan claimed that he had redubbed that portion of the interview,
which Wego had written down on paper, at Wego's request. But he
insisted that Wego had related the story to him personally.</P>
      <P>However, rather than clarify the matter, Fan's remarks served to
cast more doubt on the authenticity of his story.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWANESE STAR PITCHER TO RETIRE FROM JAPANESE PRO-BASEBALL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  Oct.  5  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwanese star pitcher Kuo Tai-yuan will
retire from Japan's Seibu Lions professional baseball team at the end
of this baseball season.</P>
      <P>Kuo, who used to be nicknamed "Eastern Express" for his speed,
gave his farewell pitching Sunday in a match with the Daiei team.
An emotional Kuo, accompanined by his wife Chang Chun-chih, a
former television actress, and their daughter, bade farewell to tens
of thousands of his fans at the end of the game.</P>
      <P>Though Seibu lost to Daiei in the Sunday match, the team was
already certain to win this year's championship in the Pacific League
on Friday. It will vie for the national title with the Central
League champion team Yakult starting on Oct. 18.</P>
      <P>Kuo, 36, joined Seibu in 1985 after representing the Republic of
China on Taiwan in many regional and international baseball
contests. He played a leading role in helping the ROC team win a
bronze medal in the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games.</P>
      <P>During his nearly 13 years with Seibu, Kuo recorded 117 wins, 68
losses and 18 reliefs. During the period, Seibu won eight Pacific
League championships.</P>
      <P>Kuo has set many outstanding records over the past 13
years, including pitching a no-hit, no-run perfect match in 1985. He
has also won many awards, including a Pacific League MVP award in
1991.</P>
      <P>Kuo decided to retire because of his age and an old wound to his
right hand, which has affected his performance in the past two
seasons.</P>
      <P>Kuo earned more than 1 billion Japanese yen (about NT$260.3
million) during his stint with Seibu.</P>
      <P>Kuo and his wife are scheduled to return to Taiwan in
mid-November. He is expected to continue his baseball career after
return to his homeland.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Major League, one of Taiwan's two professional
baseball leagues, reportedly intends to hire Kuo by offering an
annual income of NT$10 million. The income will include a
monthly salary of NT$500,000 plus advertisement revenues and prize
money.</P>
      <P>However, Kuo said he has yet to make a final decision on whether
to join the Taiwan Major League.</P>
      <P>Another Taiwanese star pitcher Kuo Yuan-chih, who returned to
Taiwan last year after pitching for Japan's Central League Chunichi
Dragons team for more than 20 years, has decided to go back to Japan
to serve as a coach next year.</P>
      <P>Kuo Yuan-chih, who plays for Taiwan's President Lions team
during the current baseball season, was disappointed by Taiwan's
pro-baseball climate. Taiwan's seven-year pro-baseball community
has been troubled by a marred image resulting from alleged
involvement of some of its players in gambling and game fixing.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SINGAPORE'S OFFICE RENTS MAY SOFTEN FURTHER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Oct.  5  (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore's office rents remained in
seventh spot in a recently conducted global survey by property
consultancy Knight Frank.</P>
      <P>However, average rents have softened by between 5 percent and 10
percent so far in 1997 and could fall by another 5 percent before the
office rental market starts to consolidate next year.</P>
      <P>The total average annual cost of occupying an office in Singapore
was US$83 per square foot, about 57 percent lower than top-ranked
Seoul at US$130 psf a year, according to the survey.</P>
      <P>Seoul displaced other high-flying cities such as Bombay and Tokyo
to top the list. Hong Kong, with US$111 psf, took the second spot in
the global survey.</P>
      <P>The third through tenth ranked areas in descending order were
London-West End (US$99 psf); London-City (US$95 psf); Bombay, (US$93
psf); Moscow (US$85 psf); Singapore (US$83 psf); Beijing (US$78 psf);
New Delhi (US$70 psf); and Tokyo (US$62 psf).</P>
      <P>The survey said the outlook for office rents in Asia was bleak
and rents have come under pressure in most countries because of
rising supply.</P>
      <P>In addition, rent-free periods, incentives and flexible lease
terms have become more common.</P>
      <P>It said the supply of offices will increase in Singapore, China,
Malaysia and Thailand and predicted falling rents in Singapore.</P>
      <P>However, rents could start rising again late next year or early
in 1999 when the bulk of the supply has been absorbed by steady
demand.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hong Kong's office rents -- the world's second highest
-- have held up well because of the renewed confidence after the July
1 handover to Beijing's rule, but the market could be heading for
oversupply next year, said a Knight Frank research director.</P>
      <P>He also noted that office rents in emerging markets like India's
Bombay and China's Beijing and Shanghai had been volatile.</P>
      <P>This is due to the sudden influx of foreign companies colliding
with a limited supply of existing offices, which drives rents up, he
said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WIPO CUTS INTERNATIONAL PATENT FEES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,   Oct.  4  (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Geneva-based World International
Property Organization (WIPO), the United Nations agency that
administers global treaties on patents, copyrights and trademarks, is
cutting international patent fees by an average of 15 percent.</P>
      <P>The move comes in response to criticism it is pilling up huge
surpluses from its patent activities, a spokesman of the WIPO said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>A record 47,291 applications were filed in 1996, a rise of more
than 20 percent from the previous year, and the increase in the first
six months of 1997 was an additional 12.6 percent. The number of WIPO
staff, now 650, is rising at a similar rate.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said the cut in patent fees, from about US$524 to
US$448, would not reduce total patent income, given the increasing
volume of applications. Further fee reductions may be considered in
due course.</P>
      <P>Under WIPO's Patent Cooperation Treaty, inventors can make a
single patent application to cover a large number of countries,
though they may need to go through procedures within individual
nations at a later date in order to receive more comprehensive
protection.</P>
      <P>WIPO's profitable patent business has made the UN agency
virtually self-supporting. Nine-tenths of its US$100 million a year
budget is financed from patent fees and other revenue-raising
activities.</P>

    <DATELINE>Los  Angeles,  Oct.  4  (CNA)
(By Philip Liu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Los Angeles Times said in a
datelined report from Colon, Panama, on Saturday that "beneath a
larger-than-life poster proclaiming the friendship between their
lands, Panamanian President Ernesto Perez Balladares and Taiwanese
President Lee Teng-hui last month inaugurated a keystone of this
country's (Panama's) economic future."</P>
      <P>"They cut the ribbon for Davis industrial park, the biggest
industrial investment so far on the former US military bases being
returned to Panama under the terms of a 1977 canal treaty. Eight
Taiwanese companies have set up export factories here in a crucial
vote of confidence for Panama's efforts to turn the old bases into
thriving, job-producing manufacturing centers. The $25-million
investment is expected to grow to $90-million in five years.</P>
      <P>"Still, even that project is overshadowed by the $150 million or
more that Panamanian authorities said Hutchison Whampoa plans to
invest during the same period in Panama's two most important ports.
The Hong Kong conglomerate also will pay Panama $22.2 million a year
for 25 years for the concession to run the ports, turned over to
Panama under the same treaty as the bases."</P>
      <P>The Times said, "apparently, the Hong Kong and Taiwan investments
are complementary parts of building Panama's future after the United
States completes its gradual pullout from the canal in 1999. But they
represent conflicting interests: The former British colony of Hong
Kong on July 1 was returned to (Communist) China, which regards
Taiwan as a renegade province. And the importance of that change half
a world away from Panama became clear last month when (Communist)
China, for the first time, used Hong Kong's economic clout to punish
a nation for its ties to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Lee told Panama's Congress that, `if the Panama Canal or the
economy of the nation is affected for having taken this fair and
courageous position, I believe the nations of the world, especially
(Taiwan), should cooperate as much as possible with Panama,'" the
Times reported.</P>
      <P>"Economic cooperation has been key to Taiwan's ability to keep
its allies, mainly small, poor Latin American and African nations.
Taiwan recently has funded a trade office in its capital, Taipei, for
Panama's neighbors and pledged $200 million to create an `economic
cooperation' fund to strengthen bilateral ties and increase trade
with the five Central American nations, which now totals about $260
million a year," the report continued.</P>
      <P>It pointed out that until taking over Hong Kong, Communist China
was hard-pressed to respond to Taiwan's economic overtures to its
allies. Panamanian Vice President Tomas Altamirano Duque recently
dismissed Communist China's threats, saying Beijing "has not given us
much help."</P>
      <P>"As (Communist) China's pressure and Taiwan's defiance both rise,
Panama may be forced to choose between the two. And the factors that
affect that choice could influence whether this country's (Panama's)
neighbors in Central America -- one of the few regions where Taiwan
holds diplomatic sway -- ultimately switch alliances," the daily
said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATURE SCREENS ANTI-DOMESTIC VIOLENCE BILL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  6  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan's judicial, interior
and education affairs committees called a joint meeting on Monday to
screen an anti-domestic violence bill.</P>
      <P>The bill, introduced by Legislator Pan Wei-kang (KMT-Taipei
City) and endorsed by 36 other lawmakers of different political
stripes, marks Taiwan's first legislation against domestic violence.</P>
      <P>Addressing the meeting, Pan, who also chairs the nonprofit Modern
Women Foundation, said domestic violence has worsened in Taiwan and
has in many cases seriously affected the family's social functions.</P>
      <P>Worse yet, Pan said, conservative concepts which hold that the
law should not concern itself with domestic issues and that officials
should not become involved in family disputes have served to deny
many victims of domestic violence access to proper governmental and
public assistance.</P>
      <P>Pan, who has long been outspoken on domestic violence-related
issues, said the most effective way to protect the members of society
is to enact an anti-domestic violence law.</P>
      <P>The legislation will provide for the establishment of a
comprehensive system to offer timely and attentive protection for
domestic violence victims by pooling resources of judicial, police,
medical, educational, social counseling and welfare service
organizations, Pan said.</P>
      <P>In addition, Pan said, educational institutes and social groups
should work hand in hand to instill in the public consciousness the
concept of gender equality and the importance of using nonviolent
means to resolve family disputes.</P>
      <P>The 60-article bill sets forth legal definitions of "domestic
violence," contains regulations designed to protect victims of
domestic violence and establishes guidelines for handling child
custody and other related issues.</P>
      <P>According to the draft bill, domestic violence victims can apply
for court protection, and police officers are authorized to act on
their own discretion in dealing with domestic violence cases. The
bill also requires the government to set up a domestic violence
prevention commission and a treatment center to offer rescue,
counseling and treatment services.</P>
      <P>A number of legislators present at the meeting urged the
executive branch to present its own version of an anti-domestic
violence bill to the Legislature to facilitate the deliberation of
related measures.</P>
      <P>Relevant government agencies, including the Ministry of the
Interior, the National Police Administration and judicial organs,
have met five times to discuss an anti-domestic violence bill which
corresponds to the one introduced by Pan. However, a final draft has
yet to be completed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PARAGUAY SEEKS US APPROVAL FOR JET FIGHTER DONATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Asuncion,  Oct.  6  (CNA)
(By Stephen Sheng &amp; Debbie Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Paraguayan government is seeking
approval from the United States for free transfer of 12 jet fighters
from the Republic of China to Paraguay as the aircraft were
originally built in America, the ABC Daily reported on Sunday.</P>
      <P>The ROC decided last month to donate 10 F-5E single-seat jet
fighters and two F-5F double-seat trainers to Paraguay, Taiwan's sole
diplomatic ally in South America, as a token of friendship, the ABC
said.</P>
      <P>The daily quoted ROC Vice Premier John Chang as saying that the
transfer of 12 combat planes to the Paraguayan Air Force is a
donation aimed at strengthening bilateral relations, rather than a
sale. However, the gesture is subject to approval from Washington
because the original purchase agreement between the ROC and the
United States prohibits the transfer of the planes to a third country
without permission.</P>
      <P>Chang said in late September that the donation of the US-made
fighters will not affect the ROC Air Force's combat preparedness. He
added that the timetable for delivery will hinge on the arrival in
Taiwan of second-generation warplanes.</P>
      <P>The ABC said the ROC Air Force will also provide 70 percent of
the related components and parts, as well as assist in training 21
Paraguayan pilots.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for Paraguayan Air Force Command said the 12 fighters
will help boost Paraguay's air defensive capabilities without posing
a security threat to neighboring countries.</P>
      <P>The ROC currently has 250 F-5Es as the backbone of its air
defense. But, as its second-generation buildup plan is proceeding
smoothly with the delivery of 150 F-16 and 60 Mirage 2000-5 jet
fighters ordered from the United States and France, respectively, the
military plans to retire some the aging F-5Es.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CPI UP 1.66 PERCENT IN SEPTEMBER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  6  (CNA)
(By Debbie Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's consumer prices rose slightly in
September over August's figures, with educational fees and fruit and
vegetable prices registering the most significant hikes, the
government reported on Monday.</P>
      <P>The consumer price index (CPI), which measures price changes from
1991 when the index stood at 100, rose 0.62 percent from the
year-earlier level to 122.46 in September, the Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) said.</P>
      <P>Compared with August, the CPI edged up 0.64 percent mainly
because of an increase in registration fees at colleges and
universities, the celebration of the Mid-Autumn Festival, one of the
three major holidays in Taiwan, and seasonal changes in the cost of
fruits and vegetables which resulted in volatile price levels, DGBAS
officials noted.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, falling prices for other commodities, including
those for pork, poultry and betel nuts, has helped to curb
inflationary pressures, they said.</P>
      <P>As a result, the wholesale price index dropped 0.68 percent in
September from the previous month, posting negative growth for the
18th consecutive month, according to the officials.</P>
      <P>Both the export and import price indexes also dropped in
September, down 0.75 percent and 0.64 percent, respectively, as
compared with August, the DGBAS tallies showed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>1997 INFLATION RATE EXPECTED TO BE AT LOW OF 1.5 PERCENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  6  (CNA)
(By Debbie Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The annual growth rate of the domestic
consumer price index (CPI) is expected to be kept to a low of 1.5
percent for 1997 if inflation in the last quarter of this year does
not exceed third-quarter levels, the government reported on Monday.</P>
      <P>A precondition of this forecast, however, is the absence of major
factors which could fuel inflationary pressure in the next three
months, officials from the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting
and Statistics (DGBAS) said.</P>
      <P>The CPI, which measures domestic consumer price changes from the
year 1991 when the index was set at 100, rose a mere 1.09 percent in
the third quarter of this year over the same period a year ago. This
created an increase in the inflation rate that was much lower than
the DGBAS had previously estimated, DGBAS officials noted.</P>
      <P>As the impact of weather and climatic factors upon the economy
diminishes with the end of the June-September typhoon season, the
DGBAS expects that inflationary pressure in the last quarter of this
year will be reduced accordingly.</P>
      <P>The recent rise in oil prices on international markets, however,
could be instrumental in driving up the CPI, a situation which is
worthy of notice, the officials added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CANADA TO TAKE `BALANCED' APPROACH TO ASIA-PACIFIC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Oct.  5  (CNA)
(By Timothy Sun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Canada must continue to take a "balanced"
approach with its allies in the Asian Pacific region, without
focusing exclusively upon either business and trade relations or upon
issues such as human rights, the country's top diplomat said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>"Human rights are a threshold issue in all our bilateral
relations and international standard-setting is a priority for us
multilaterally," Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy said.</P>
      <P>"In both these arenas, our basic policy is one of effective
influence. That means supporting change from within by building
domestic grassroots capacity," he told the National Foreign Policy
Conference in Regina, Saskatchewan.</P>
      <P>Axworthy cited Indonesia as an example, saying Canada's good
relationship with Jakarta allows for an open dialogue on human rights
that might otherwise not exist. He did not mention mainland China,
whose human rights record is equally poor, if not worse, for fear of
upsetting the Communist leaders of Canada's largest wheat market.</P>
      <P>He noted that along with its business ties, Canada has been
expanding its goodwill role in the Asian Pacific region. It has done
so through projects to fight child exploitation, battle drug
trafficking, raise awareness of human rights and ease poverty.</P>
      <P>Canada is well positioned to become a major player in the Asian
Pacific region, which he said will likely be "home to seven of the
top 10 economies in the world" in 25 years.</P>
      <P>"Surely no country is better suited than Canada to deal with the
subtleties and complexities in Asia-Pacific," he claimed, noting that
since 1979, Canada has had more immigrants from across the Pacific
than from across the Atlantic.</P>
      <P>That helps create and strengthen ties and puts Canada in a strong
position to increase its presence in the region, he suggested.</P>
      <P>But more must be done and, "as we approach the new millennia, I
believe it is time to build a more formal policy framework," he told
the delegates to the policy input conference.</P>
      <P>Axworthy said that the framework includes:
 -- a continued active commitment to multilateral issues;
 -- advancing human security as the "ultimate" goal;
 -- extension of Canadian networks and knowledge of the region; and
 -- an active bilateral program of engagement.

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui conferred the Order
of Brilliant Star with Grand Cordon on Formosa Plastics Group (FPG)
Chairman Wang Yung-ching on Monday in recognition of his contribution
to Taiwan's industrial development.</P>
      <P>President Lee personally decorated Wang with the Order and
praised him for his down-to-earth working style and contributions to
society and the nation.</P>
      <P>For his part, Wang said he felt honored to receive the
decoration. "It's the most glorious day in my life."</P>
      <P>The 80-year-old tycoon went on to say that he owes much to the
country, crediting his business success to Taiwan's phenomenal
economic development over the past four decades.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has managed to develop from scratch to prosperity in a
relative short period of time mainly because of the government's wise
leadership plus the diligence of our people," Wang noted.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he said, Taiwan's industry is now at a critical
juncture of transformation and requires the government's assistance
to upgrade its technological level. "Only high technology will help
sustain growth and enable us to survive the ever-increasing global
competition."</P>
      <P>Wang concluded his speech by once again expressing his thanks for
the decoration and pledging to redouble his efforts to repay his debt
of gratitude to the country and society.</P>
      <P>Scores of senior government officials and business leaders were
invited to witness the decoration ceremony at the Presidential
Office.</P>
      <P>Wang is the third local business magnate to receive the
decoration. The first two were Chinatrust Group Chairman C.F. Koo,
who is also Taiwan's top negotiator with mainland China, and Wang
Yu-yun, a former Kaohsiung mayor now with the private Chung Hsing
Commercial Bank.</P>
      <P>Some observers said the award is part of the government's efforts
to persuade large domestic enterprises to slow or suspend their
investment activities in mainland China in line with the government's
"no haste, be patient" policy on mainland-bound investment.</P>
      <P>The Formosa Group drew the government's ire earlier this year
when it announced plans to invest in a multibillion dollar power
plant project in mainland China's Fujian province. The company later
denied that it was proceeding with work on the plant in Zhangzhou in
defiance of the government's regulations.</P>
      <P>Wang was reluctant to comment on the government's mainland
investment policy at a news conference given after the decoration,
but noted that the American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei had
recently issued a white paper on Taiwan's investment and economic
policy.</P>
      <P>The white paper criticized Taiwan's "no haste, be patient"
mainland investment policy, saying it will not only hinder Taiwan's
economic development but would also discourage multinational
conglomerates from setting up their Asia-Pacific regional
headquarters on the island.</P>
      <P>The outspoken tycoon further said Taiwan's current economic
problems do not lie with its workers, but with the leadership or
managerial-level positions.</P>
      <P>Wang said the people of Taiwan are smart and diligent. "The
greatest bottleneck faced by many local enterprises is that their
management staff lacks vision and a down-to-earth working style,"
he observed.</P>
      <P>Wang went on to say that Taiwan has talent, technology,
experience and capital and that the priority task for the government
is to create an investment climate suitable for the island's
technological development.</P>
      <P>Wang lamented that local society, particularly the business
community, has become increasingly extravagant and vainglorious. "We
should not forget that diligence is the driving force behind Taiwan's
economic growth and must continue to uphold this spirit."</P>
      <P>In addition to developing high-tech industries, Wang said the
government should not ignore the upgrading of conventional steel,
shipbuilding, machinery and other related industries. "My observation
is that both high-tech and traditional industries should brace up for
increased competition and liberalization pressure following Taiwan's
entry to the World Trade Organization."</P>

    <HEADLINE>MURDER ACCOUNTS FOR 10 PERCENT OF TAIWAN FISHERMEN'S DEATHS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 6 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>About 10 percent of work-related fatalities
among Taiwan's fishermen result from acts of murder, with 58 percent
of those crimes being perpetrated by mainland Chinese, an analysis by
the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) revealed Monday.</P>
      <P>The analysis, conducted by the CLA's National Institute for
Occupational Safety and Health, also found that local and foreign
fishermen were each responsible for 16 percent of the murder cases,
while pirates of unidentified nationality committed the remaining 10
percent of such crimes.</P>
      <P>In terms of rank, captains and chief engineers aboard Taiwan's
fishing vessels are most likely to be killed, accounting for one-half
of the high-seas murder victims.</P>
      <P>As the number of local deep-sea fishermen declines, shipping
companies have been forced to employ more crewmen from the
Chinese mainland. As misunderstandings and disputes are more likely
to arise due to cultural differences between Taiwan and mainland crew
members, the institute urged shipping companies and their officers to
pay more attention to mainland Chinese crewmen's emotion and
behavior in order to prevent mutinies from occurring.</P>
      <P>The institute recently conducted a survey of occupational hazards
faced by local fishermen and made reference to the cases in creating
a relief fund for the families of murdered or disabled seamen.</P>
      <P>The institute found that the fatality rate of 5.5 per 10,000
workers in the fishing industry was twice as high as that of 2.7 per
10,000 in the construction sector.</P>
      <P>In analyzing the causes of death, the institute found that
one-third of the fatalities were attributed to crew members falling
overboard at sea. Twenty percent of the deaths were caused by the
capsizing of fishing vessels, with sudden illnesses making up another
20 percent of high-seas fatalities. Accidents in fishing operations
accounted for 16 percent, while murder at the hands of other crewmen
accounted for 10 percent.</P>

described a future without geographical territories, as a result of
NII development. The NII will also help globalize the small- and
medium-sized enterprises sector, improve management quality in
state-owned organizations and increase participation by the private
sector in public affairs, thus contributing to democratization, he
said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan cannot afford to be a late entry in NII development if it
wants to realize its goal of turning itself into a "high-tech"
island, Lee stressed.</P>
      <P>The NII, originally used only by the academic sector and the
military, has become the principal platform for global information
exchange and high-tech cooperation. A "living environment" of the
future, NII services will include academic instruction, video
conferencing, multimedia databases, cable TV services and on-line
medical diagnosis.</P>
      <P>However, Lee, a Nobel Prize winner, reminded his audience that
the ultimate goal of NII development is not just for economic
prosperity. Instead, it should be aimed at seeking sustainable
development throughout the world.</P>
      <P>While developing cutting-edge innovations in the field of
science, he said, the human race should also address other issues
which are equally vital to the successful future of the species.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HU JINTAO'S PROSPECTS AS HEIR-APPARENT OF CPC 4TH GENERATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  6 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Hu Jintao, previously the seventh and most
junior standing member of the Politburo of the Communist Party of
China (CPC), was promoted to fifth position at the just-concluded
15th National Congress of CPC. The sheer fact that Hu is only 55
years of age is worthy of special attention.</P>
      <P>CPC General Secretary Jiang Zemin mentioned Hu's new role at
meetings with several foreign visitors recently, underlining Hu's
prominence as a rising star and heir-apparent of the CPC's
fourth-generation leadership.</P>
      <P>But whether Hu's fortunes will follow those of his predecessors
Liu Shaoqi, Lin Biao, Hua Guofeng, Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang, all of
whom were eventually ousted, or whether he will come to the fore as
Jiang Zemin did, all depends on his political wisdom and the
prevailing conditions.</P>
      <P>Hu has already broken several records on mainland China's
political stage:</P>
      <P>-- He became the youngest member of the CPC Central Committee at
the 12th National Congress in 1982;</P>
      <P>-- He became the youngest secretary of the CPC Provincial
Committee in 1985;</P>
      <P>-- He became the youngest member of the cross-century fourth
generation leadership at the 14th party congress in 1992 when he was
promoted to standing member of the CPC Politburo.</P>
      <P>With his wealth of political experience, Hu's future is
considered very bright by many political observers. After having been
one of the seven standing members of the CPC Politburo and having
administered the personnel and organizational sections for five
years, Hu's political assets are both broad and deep. He is also the
principal of the Central Party School.</P>
      <P>If we analyze the failures of his predecessors, Hu will have to
be especially wary to avoid these potential pitfalls:</P>
      <P>-- Do not defy the leaders of former generations as did Liu
Shaoqi and Lin Biao toward Mao Zedong, or as did Hu Yaobang and Zhao
Ziyang toward the CPC old guard.</P>
      <P>-- Do not act contrary to the will of the people and be wary of
one's international image. Although designated heir-apparent by Mao
himself, Hua Guofeng was replaced by Deng Xiaoping as paramount
leader of mainland China because the people were disappointed with
Hua's adherence to Mao's line after the end of the 10-year Cultural
Revolution. In later years, Premier Li Peng's notorious international
image as "the butcher of Tiananmen" resulted in his being ranked
second to Jiang Zemin, although Jiang is actually junior to Li in the
mainland political hierarchy.</P>
      <P>-- Do not lend your support to the wrong side. The decline in the
power structure of Politburo member Tian Jiyun and Central Committee
member Hu Qili were due to their siding with the ousted Zhao Ziyang,
while Central Committee member Wang Zhaoguo's downfall was due to his
having sided with Hu Yaobang. Wang, who was secretary of the CPC
Secretariat in 1985, has never been restored to his former level.</P>
      <P>-- Do not set yourself up as heir-apparent prematurely. The fall
of Liu Shaoqi, Lin Biao, Hua Guofeng, Hu Yaobang, Zhao Ziyang and the
frustrations of Li Peng and Hu Qili were all the result of posing as
heir-apparent prematurely.</P>
      <P>Taking into account all these factors, it is evident that Hu is
facing a long and hard climb if he is to successfully achieve the top
post in Beijing at the 16th Party Congress five years from now.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SERVICE PRICES IN TAIWAN SHOW SMALLEST RISE IN DECADE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei  Oct.6 (CNA)
(By Lawrence Chu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Prices for services in Taiwan between January
and September rose by the smallest percentage in a decade, according
to statistics released on Monday by the Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>In its report on consumer prices for September, the DGBAS said
prices in the service category rose by 2.34 percent between January
and September over the same period of 1996, the smallest increase in
this category since 1987.</P>
      <P>A DGBAS spokesman told reporters the low increase was the result
of smaller salary increases for military, education and government
personnel, although efforts aimed at improving production costs had
not been as successful as in the past.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said that during the nine-month period, salaries
for military, education and government personnel were only raised by
3 percent, while workers in the manufacturing sector saw their
paychecks rise 3.1 percent, both rather small increases.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that in terms of costs, a comparison of ten-year
periods shows that Taiwan's Wholesale Price Index (WPI) from 1977 to
1986 increased by an average of 4.2 percent, while the figure only
rose by 0.2 percent in the decade between 1987 and 1996.</P>
      <P>Comparing Taiwan's situation to those of neighboring countries,
WPI increases in Japan during the same two ten-year periods amounted
to 1.5 percent and -0.7 percent, respectively, while for South Korea,
the figures were 10.1 percent and 2.0 percent.</P>
      <P>The spokesman also said that minimal pay increases and free
interaction within the labor market were additional reasons for
stable service sector prices. Traditional manufacturing industries
and service industries both have a high degree of labor substitution
and salary levels in both sectors tend to have a restraining effect
on each other, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Even though salaries in new service industries have increased by
14.7 percent, much higher than the 3.1 percent rise in the
manufacturing sector, the overall service price index was still
affected by the mutually restraining effect between manufacturing and
service sector salaries, he said.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan branch of US-based Dreyer's Ice
Cream Co. announced on Monday it is recalling all of its Cookies 'N
Cream bars from local stores for inspection because of fears the
product may be contaminated by a potentially dangerous bacteria.</P>
      <P>The product will not be distributed again in Taiwan until the
ROC's Bureau of Commodity Inspection and Quarantine confirms that it
is not contaminated by the bacteria "listeria monocytogenes," a
Dreyer's spokesman said.</P>
      <P>The company made the announcement after foreign wire service
reports said over the weekend that the bacteria had been found in
Dreyer's Cookies 'N Cream bars being sold in Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said Taiwan has imported 8,600 of the candy bars,
2,300 of which have already entered the local market. "Even though
the product imported into Taiwan does not belong to the same batch
that was shipped to Hong Kong, we still decided to recall the product
for inspection to ensure safety," the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Local health officials said the bacteria can exist in a wide
variety of living environments and can infect both humans and
animals. The bacteria can, in severe cases, cause infection of the
brain and potentially lethal meningitis. The bacteria is killed in
foodstuffs which have undergone high-temperature treatment or which
have been stored at a temperature of minus 8 degrees Celsius, the
officials said.</P>

(By Kuo Chuan Hsin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>"No one can expect us to keep silent about
this conspiracy concerning our territories, and Baghdad has the right
to defend itself," a senior Iraqi diplomat said Sunday.</P>
      <P>He was commenting upon the recent decision by Washington to send
an aircraft carrier to enforce the no-fly zone in southern Iraq,
beginning at the 33rd parallel.</P>
      <P>"We will fight this decision, even it will lead others to attack
us," the Iraqi diplomat continued.</P>
      <P>The United States, reacting to Iranian air attacks on Teheran's
main opposition group, the People's Mujaheddin, in southern Iraq last
week, announced that the aircraft carrier, the USS Nimitz, would skip
a port call in Singapore and head to the Persian Gulf.</P>
      <P>A large number of Shiite Arabs, which are the dominant group in
Iran but a minority in Iraq, inhabit the southern part of Iraq, while
the United Nations-imposed no-fly zone in northern Iraq is occupied
by another large opposition group, the ethnic Kurds.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Iran's Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi also said that
Teheran had the right to attack Iranian "terrorist" groups in Iraq,
according to remarks published by Saudi-owned newspaper al-Hatat on
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Iran has protested to the United Nations over what it said were
cross-border attacks from Iraq and said the incursions prompted its
air raids on Iranian Mujaheddin rebel bases inside Iraq last week.</P>
      <P>In response, Washington ordered the USS Nimitz to deploy in the

    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct.  6  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Hormone replacement therapy (HRT), the
"youth drug" being used by millions of women, has been indisputably
linked to breast cancer in the biggest study to date of its long-term
risks, according to mass-circulation newspaper The Australian on
Monday.</P>
      <P>The study shows that among some groups of women taking HRT, the
risk of developing breast cancer was 2.3 times higher than that of
non-users.</P>
      <P>It shows the overall risk of breast cancer is 35 percent higher
if women take HRT on average for 11 years, according to a draft of
a report on the study.</P>
      <P>The research, which pooled data from more than 40 previous
projects involving more than 60,000 women, was designed to resolve
the controversy over whether HRT causes breast cancer, the daily
reported.</P>
      <P>The Australian quoted health officials as estimating that about
one million Australian women who have passed menopause, take a daily
pill which replaces estrogen, the hormone produced naturally by the
body during fertile years.</P>
      <P>The aim is to reduce the risk of dementia, osteoporosis and heart
disease, all of which have been linked to declining hormonal levels.</P>
      <P>But results of the overall study are still being disputed by
authors of some of the individual sections, who argue that the
publication of the report will cause unnecessary panic among HRT
users.</P>
      <P>Researchers said the link between HRT and developing breast
cancer is clear, but added that there is no evidence that HRT
affected death rates from the disease.</P>
      <P>The daily reported the manufacturers of HRT declined to make any
comment on the study.</P>
      <P>Breast cancer surgeon and lecturer Vernon Marshall of the Monash
University in Melbourne told the daily that the report's findings
were not unexpected, but said that they must also be weighed against
HRT's benefits.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI-BEIJING TIES SEEN IMPROVING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct.  6  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Relations between Taiwan and mainland
China are expected to improve as bilateral ties between Washington
and Beijing head towards new balance with the first official visit of
President Jiang Zemin to America later this month, a leading
Australian strategic expert said on Monday.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the CNA, Gary Klintworth, a visiting fellow
at the Department of International Relations of the Australian
National University, said he believes the 1996 tension between Taiwan
and mainland China to be over and that ties across the Taiwan Strait
will improve.</P>
      <P>"This can be justified by studying the history between Taiwan and
China. Since 1949, when ties between the US and China were bad,
Beijing would become angry with Taiwan. But when relations between
Washington and Beijing get better, ties between China and Taiwan also
improve," he said.</P>
      <P>He described the 1995 tension between Taiwan and the mainland
following Beijing's missile-firing exercises off the island as the
result of worsening ties between Washington and Beijing because the
US government granted Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui a visa to visit
Cornell University, his alma mater.</P>
      <P>Klintworth last month went to Beijing and Shanghai, where he
engaged in extensive discussions on the triangular ties between the
US, Taiwan and the mainland with strategists there.</P>
      <P>Klintworth said that from the discussions he concluded that "a
new balance has been struck between China and the US. Both sides
accept that their interests outweigh the sum of their differences and
that conflict resolution and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region
are contingent on a cooperative Sino-US relationship."</P>
      <P>"The Clinton administration has reaffirmed its commitment to a
one-China policy, including no US support for Taiwan's UN membership
bid and a warning to Taipei that the US is not prepared to support
Taiwan's independence. The US also reaffirmed its commitment to a
peaceful resolution of the Taiwan issue," he said.</P>
      <P>"Jiang Zemin's China can live with that. Beijing reaffirmed that
while it will not renounce the use of force, its priority is peaceful
reunification with Taiwan and the avoidance of conflict with the US,"
he said.</P>
      <P>"Besides, China is in no doubt about the technological
superiority enjoyed by the US armed forces," he said.</P>
      <P>He mentioned that China's defense minister, Chi Haotian, was
shown some of America's most modern and formidable military hardware
during his visit to the US last December.</P>
      <P>"According to Chinese security advisers that I interviewed last
month in China's leading strategic studies institutes... China is now
happier with the US In the Chinese view, America has adjusted its
China policy after being jolted by the Taiwan Strait crisis of
1995-96," Klintworth said.</P>
      <P>"According to these strategists, most US policymakers believe
that confrontation with China is not in the best interests of either
the US or China and that as the Asia-Pacific region's two most
important powers, China and the US share too many strategic
interests. Sensationalist predictions about a coming war between
China and the US were dismissed as a minority viewpoint," he said.</P>
      <P>Klintworth said the present US government understands that a
policy of containment towards mainland China is likely to leave the
US as the state that is isolated.</P>
      <P>"The aftermath of the Tiananmen affair in 1989 and the Taiwan
Strait crisis in 1995-96 suggests that most countries in the region
prefer to accommodate, not confront, China's rise," he said.</P>
      <P>"For its part, Chinese policymakers realize, belatedly, that US
foreign policy is not just made by the Administration, but includes
Congress, the media, think-tanks and corporate America. The US
Congress, meanwhile, better understands China's sensitivity on the
Taiwan issue.</P>
      <P>"The revised US strategy for engaging China is practical,
strategically sound and potentially very profitable for both sides
and for the Asia-Pacific region, with enormous commercial
opportunities for both China and the US and the wider Asia-Pacific
community," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MORE DOCTORS USE FINE NEEDLES TO CHECK CANCEROUS LUMPS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Oct. 6 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More doctors in Singapore are turning to
the use of a fine needle to find out whether tumors are cancerous or
not.</P>
      <P>Called Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) biopsy, the technique uses a
very fine needle to obtain a tiny part of the lump tissue which is
then mounted on a glass slide for evaluation under the microscope.</P>
      <P>Results are usually obtained within hours.</P>
      <P>Conventional biopsy, on the other hand, involves the surgical
removal of the lump, which usually requires general anesthesia and
hospitalization. Results usually take a few days to obtain.</P>
      <P>Not surprisingly, the number of FNA biopsies in Singapore have
been increasing steadily by about 10 percent annually since the
technique was first introduced in the late 1980s, said Dr. Angela
Chong, a spokeswoman for a three-day FNA workshop, which ended here
on Sunday.</P>
      <P>The workshop, attended by more than 60 pathologists from around
the region, was organized by the Chapter of Pathologists, the Academy
of Medicine and the Singapore Society of Pathologists.</P>
      <P>Last year, about 4,000 FNA biopsies were done in government and
private hospitals in Singapore, many of which were biopsies for
thyroid and breast growths, she said.</P>
      <P>The Singapore National University Hospital has one of the largest
published series of fine-needle biopsies of the liver in the world --
92 liver cancers were diagnosed using the method between 1985 and
1992.</P>
      <P>Fine-needle aspiration biopsy is widely used in most developed
countries.</P>

      <P>Taipei's police force will work even harder
to protect the city's youth from dangerous influences ranging from
pornography to drugs, Mayor Chen Shui-ban said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks at a ceremony honoring police officers who
played key roles in the recent apprehension of suspects involved in
selling pornographic CD-ROMs and illegal drugs to youths.</P>
      <P>The arrests took place in busts which included the break-up of
gang-controlled rings that had been selling pirated pornographic
CD-ROMs at the Kuang-hua Market, a popular major retail center for
computers and software, and raids on pubs, dance-halls and clubs
known to be popular places for the sale and use of illegal drugs like
ecstasy and amphetamines.</P>
      <P>The raids were conducted by city police with tips from the
Municipal Bureau of Information and the Bureau of Health.</P>
      <P>In his remarks to the police officers at the ceremony, Chen said
his first priority was crime prevention, especially with regard to
the new types of crime that have surfaced in recent years.</P>
      <P>He described this policy as being in line with the desire to
solve criminal cases, as well as being the best way to keep problems
from rapidly worsening and creating a further burden on police
resources.</P>
      <P>The mayor pointed out that sales of so-called "Big Tonic" or
"DBT" pornographic CD-ROMs and illegal drugs are not only harming the
city's youth, but also severely worsening social order in the
city.</P>
      <P>For the sake of the country's future development, the authorities
cannot tolerate the sale of illegal drugs, he said.</P>
      <P>He also commended the bureaus of health and information for
their cooperation with the police.</P>
      <P>Mayor Chen also inspected the city's Criminal Investigation Corps
and presented citations to some 30 officers.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's foreign trade performed vigorously
in the third quarter of this year, with growth in both exports and
imports in September, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) said on Monday.</P>
      <P>According to statistics the MOF is to release on Tuesday,
Taiwan's exports amounted to over US$10.3 billion in September, up 8
percent from the previous month, while imports reached about US$9.6
billion, up more than 20 percent.</P>
      <P>Most export items were from the information and electrical
sectors, the MOF said, adding that Taiwan imported numerous military
goods, as well as lots of components for automatic data processors
and integrated circuit boards in September.</P>
      <P>Although the island's imports grew more than its exports did last
month, resulting in a declining trade surplus, Taiwan's performance
in foreign trade is still "healthy" because most of the additional
imports will be used for production here, the MOF said.</P>
      <P>The ministry predicted exports in the fourth quarter will perform
well, based on increasing orders and an average 7 percent rise in

    <HEADLINE>LOCAL PRESS COMMENT ON SPECULATIVE ATTACKS ON TAIWAN CURRENCY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Sept.  6  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The following are excerpts from an
editorial carried in Monday's edition of local English-language daily
The China Post.</P>
      <P>The CBC Must Firmly Curb Speculation</P>
      <P>During the last two business days, the Taipei foreign exchange
market saw a massive sell-off of the New Taiwan dollar.</P>
      <P>The large sales of the NT dollar last week came mainly as a
result of widespread market expectations for the depreciation of the
local currency. Many traders and investors expected a lower NT dollar
for a number of reasons. First, they believed that the lingering
Southeast Asian currency crises would sooner or later impact other
regional markets, such as Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Second, Taiwan's domestic unfavorable economic changes of late
could build downward pressure on the NT dollar. One such change was a
slowdown in export growth. Another adverse development was a
continuous falling stock market, which could cause more foreign
institutional investors to pull their funds out of Taiwan. But a
closer look at these local economic conditions will find the market's
speculation for the NT dollar to undergo major depreciation lacks
solid foundation. Although Taiwan's exports have slowed somewhat this
year, the island still enjoyed a surplus of more than US$4 billion
thus far...</P>
      <P>Although some foreign institutional investors seem to have
continued to remit more funds out of Taiwan than they sent in lately
because of a continued decline of the stock market, yet since foreign
equity investments account for only a small 4 percent of the local
bourse's capitalization, such a trend is unlikely to cause a major
destabilizing effect on the local forex market.</P>
      <P>In regard to speculation that the NT dollar could come under
potential wild speculative attack simply because of a possible
fallout from Southeast Asian markets, that is not well-based.
Countries like Thailand and Malaysia, which are currently faced with
currency crises, are suffering such problems because their economic
fundamentals have gone wrong.</P>
      <P>That is not the situation with Taiwan. Unlike those economies,
Taiwan's financial markets are generally healthy. Its balance of
international payments has always remained favorable. And it has the
world's third-largest foreign exchange reserves of some US$90
billion...</P>
      <P>So the market expectations for the NT dollar to depreciate were
unreasonable and it was right for the CBC to intervene under current
circumstances, prevent speculative attacks and maintain orderly
transactions.</P>

      <P>The state-run China Petroleum Corp. (CPC)
will be privatized by fiscal 2001 as scheduled, Economics Minister
Wang Chih-kang said Monday.</P>
      <P>Wang said that despite strong voices of opposition from the CPC

      <P>In line with the privatization plan, 15 percent of CPC shares
will be released in fiscal 1998, and additional 37 percent will be
released in Taiwan and abroad over the following three fiscal years,
Wang said while answering questions from lawmakers at the Legislative

      <P>Wang said he believes that the new CPC chairman, Chen Chou-wei,
who was former executive director of the Commission of National

(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The development of democracy in Taiwan
will remain the key factor in US support for the island, a former
high ranking US official on Taiwan affairs said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Nat Bellocchi, former chairman of the American Institute in
Taiwan (AIT), said in a speech here that while emphasizing the
significance of its first popular presidential election held last
year, Taiwan also needs to introduce the international community to
more of its achievements in democratization in order to promote its
international profile.</P>
      <P>Taiwan should let the world gain a better understanding of the
island's current social, political, and economic situations via a
variety of channels and means, Bellocchi suggested, adding that
Taiwan need not keep mentioning that it has made a lot of progress
compared with 20 or 30 years ago.</P>
      <P>On cross-strait relations, Bellocchi said that the US government
has never pressured Taiwan to hold negotiations with mainland China.
Washington simply hopes that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait can
have more contacts, he added.</P>
      <P>Bellocchi said that when he served as AIT chairman between August
1990 and December 1995, he often told the US State Department that
Washington should attach more importance to Taiwan. He also denied
that the State Department is unfriendly to Taiwan, citing the
department's unprecedented announcement that whether or not Taiwan
will be reunified with mainland China should be decided by the people
of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Bellocchi delivered his speech at a luncheon meeting sponsored by
the Kaohsiung-based Asian Pacific Public Affairs Forum (APPAF). He
praised the forum and other such private organizations, saying that
they can help Taiwan increase its international profile by conducting
academic and cultural exchanges with private organizations in the
United States and other countries.</P>

      <P>ROC-Spanish relations have been improving
for the last year or two, along with the improvement in ties between
other West European countries and the Republic of China, said a
senior Foreign Ministry official Monday, one day after Vice President
Lien Chan left for Iceland on a private visit.</P>
      <P>Lien will reportedly stop over in the Iberian state on his way
back home.</P>
      <P>Chen Chien-jen, vice foreign minister, told CNA that the
friendship Taiwan and Spain once shared sank to a nadir after 1973,
when Madrid broke its ties with Taipei.</P>
      <P>Thanks to a recent increase in exchanges between Taiwan and West
European states, Madrid and Taipei have been improving their ties
with each other along with gaining an increasing understanding of
each other's economic development and democratization, and both have
expressed an interest in beefing up trade and commercial ties, said
Chen.</P>
      <P>Trade and economic ties -- which have helped Taiwan forge
non-official relations with many countries in the absence of
diplomatic ties -- are a vital part of modern diplomacy, Chen said,
adding that Beijing's attempts to isolate Taipei on the international
stage have been the major obstacle to the island's efforts to expand
its international role.</P>
      <P>However, the vice minister said that more and more countries have
realized recently that they could choose their own friends on the
diplomatic stage without taking into account Beijing's desires.</P>
      <P>Chen, who visited Spain in May, denied that his trip was aimed at
laying the groundwork for Lien's visit to Madrid.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>China Airlines (CAL) has made all necessary
preparations for the opening of air links between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait, CAL Chairman Chiang Hung-yi said here
Monday.</P>
      <P>Chiang predicted that CAL will not begin flight services to
mainland China within the coming year, but he was optimistic about
the long-term prospects for cross-strait air links as the atmosphere
between the two sides has become more relaxed in recent months.</P>
      <P>Chiang traveled to Thailand to preside over a celebration marking
the 30th anniversary of CAL's Bangkok branch office.</P>
      <P>To prepare for the inauguration of cross-strait air links, CAL
has established CAL-Asia Investment Inc. in the Virgin Islands and
set up an office in Beijing, Chiang said. CAL has also reached
agreement with some mainland airlines, including China Southern
Airline and China Northern Airline, to provide transit passengers
with inter-airline boarding passes and to check luggage directly
through to their final destinations, he added.</P>
      <P>In an interview with CNA, Chiang also said that CAL attaches
great importance to its flight routes in Southeast Asia. Recently it
has opened a charter service between Taipei and Rangoon, Burma. Due
to high demand, the airline plans to increase its twice-weekly
flights to three flights a week.</P>
      <P>The CAL also hopes to open routes to South Asian countries such
as India, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>Chiang said CAL is currently working to train its own corps
of pilots. It has so far sent nine groups of personnel for
training in the United States. In addition, the airline also sent
two groups of trainees to Germany.</P>
      <P>In order to operate the fleet of 67 planes it expects to field by
the year 2003, CAL will also invite retired foreign pilots or
discharged air force pilots to serve the former national flag
carrier.</P>
      <P>Chiang said CAL presently has crew members from Japan, Thailand,
Malaysia and Singapore. If there are needs to increase the number of
flights to Europe, he added, the company will consider recruiting

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 7 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's chronic trade imbalance with Japan
has worsened this year because of dwindling exports to that country,
the Ministry of Finance (MOF) reported on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan managed to post a 4.9 percent gain in overall
outbound shipments for the first three quarters of this year, its
monthly sales to Japan have continued to suffer double-digit declines
for several months.</P>
      <P>According to MOF tallies, Taiwan exports to Japan registered a 13
percent year-on-year drop in August and the annual rate of decrease
expanded to an alarming 15.5 percent in September.</P>
      <P>Taiwan exported only US$900 million worth of goods to Japan in
September, while importing US$2.57 billion worth of Japanese
products. As a result, Taiwan registered a trade deficit of US$1.69
billion in that month alone.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's accumulated trade deficit with Japan for the first nine
months of this year has already topped US$15 billion, far higher than
the US$10.23 billion recorded for the same period of last year and
larger even than the US$13.83 billion registered for all of 1996.</P>
      <P>MOF officials attributed the serious drop in Japan-bound
shipments mainly to an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease at local
hog farms in March that prompted the Japanese government to ban pork
imports from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Prior to implementation of the ban, Japan had been Taiwan's
largest pork export market, absorbing more than 90 percent of the
island's annual exports of pork products. At the same time, imports
from Japan have continued to climb due to the increasing demand for
Japanese electronics parts and components, which has served to
further widen Taiwan's trade deficit with Japan.</P>

      <P>The foreign ministers of the Gambia,
Guinea-Bissau and Grenada on Monday expressed their support for the
Republic of China's efforts to join the United Nations and
participate in international activities.</P>
      <P>"My delegation strongly supports the aspirations of the 21.3
million people of the Republic of China on Taiwan to exercise their
rights to share and participate in the activities of
intergovernmental organizations on international cooperation by
joining this community of nations," Foreign Minister Omar Y. Njie of
the Gambia said in a speech to the UN General Assembly.</P>
      <P>The legitimacy of their aspirations, both legal and national, has
been reinforced by similar actions and measures taken by the United
Nations on the issue of parallel representation and which now serve
as useful reminders and examples, he stressed.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan question is also a test of the international
community's interpretation of "democracy," and the participation of
the ROC on Taiwan in the United Nations can only enrich the
organization, Njie continued.</P>
      <P>The ROC has existed physically, legally and politically since the
creation of the world body, he pointed out, adding that "my
government therefore believes that our organization will do itself a
great service by admitting Taiwan among our midst, in the true spirit
of the application of democratic principles."</P>
      <P>Foreign Minister Fernando D. da Silva of Guinea-Bissau said that,
based on the principles of universality and equal sovereignty of
states, the government of Guinea-Bissau reiterated its conviction
that the ROC deserves to regain a place in the United Nations.</P>
      <P>He also praised Taiwan for its achievements in economic and
social developments and respect for fundamental human rights. The
participation of the ROC in the United Nations and its agencies would
be an important factor for the preservation of international peace,
stability and cooperation, the minister stated.</P>
      <P>On his part, Foreign Minister Raphael Fletcher of Grenada
stressed that the ROC's membership in the world body is a matter of
"justice."</P>
      <P>"To all who subscribe to the principle of the right of a people
to self-determination, the case for membership of the United Nations
organization on behalf of the Republic of China on Taiwan is a
compelling one," he indicated.</P>
      <P>Some 50 years ago, the minister explained, this people chose
self-determination. "They voted with their feet," as they moved from
their home in mainland China to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>And today, he continued, 21.3 million people practice democracy
in Taiwan. Their economic achievements are widely known, as is their
willingness to participate in the international community as a member
of the United Nations.</P>
      <P>"What more is required for the Republic of China to be admitted
to UN membership, one may well ask," Fletcher emphasized. "My answer
is `justice,'" he concluded.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN, MAINLAND BECOME ILLEGAL IVORY PROCESSING CENTERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 7 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan and mainland China have become major
illegal ivory processing centers in the Asia-Pacific region, the
Council of Agriculture (COA) reported on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Despite a global ban on ivory trade, illegal smuggling rings
still manage to smuggle large quantities of elephant tusks from
Africa to mainland China and Taiwan via Southeast Asia or Hong Kong
for processing, the council said, adding that the processed ivories
are then smuggled abroad, with ethnic Chinese as the main customers.</P>
      <P>According to the council, ivory products processed in mainland
China are usually smuggled to Hong Kong, while those processed in
Taiwan are mostly shipped to the United States.</P>
      <P>COA officials said Chinese-style ivory carvings and sculptures,
particularly those in dragon or phoenix motif, have consistently
enjoyed brisk sales in overseas Chinese communities.</P>
      <P>The officials said the hobby of collecting ivory products has
declined in Taiwan since government authorities intensified efforts
to crackdown on illegal trade in ivory a few years ago. However, they
said, illicit ivory processing has continued to exist in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>COA figures show that ivory has often topped the list of
contraband wildlife products confiscated by local law-enforcement
authorities.</P>
      <P>A total of 173 violations of the wildlife conservation law were
reported between June and September this year, with ivory-related
cases forming the largest portion, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, nearly all of the contraband goods seized by customs
offices in recent months were made of ivory, including necklaces,
folding fans, Buddhist figurines, floral vases, walking cane heads,
ink holders and chopsticks.</P>
      <P>The officials said some souvenir shops at local tourist hotels
and jewelry trading centers in downtown Taipei had been found to
illegally display ivory products.</P>
      <P>The officials said the COA will intensify its crackdown on
illegal ivory trade in addition to launching a publicity campaign to
remind local people not to purchase or own ivory items.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CCP CONGRESS REPORT NEGLECTED POLITICAL REFORM: XU JIATUN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hong  Kong, Oct. 7 (CNA)
(By Stanley Cheung &amp; Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Xu Jiatun, former Hong Kong Bureau chief
of Xinhua News Agency, criticized the report by Chinese Communist
Party (CCP) General Secretary Jiang Zemin to the party's 15th
National Congress, saying it focused upon economic development while
neglecting political reforms.</P>
      <P>Jiang has inherited the "monistic" system of leadership from late
Communist patriarch Deng Xiaoping, and its disastrous effects will
soon emerge, Xu observed in an article published Sunday in the Hong
Kong Economic Journal.</P>
      <P>Xu pointed out in the article that Jiang's report on economic
reform brings the reform of state-run enterprises going parallel with
all the other forms ownership. It is based on the premise that
"socialist public ownership is dominant, while diverse forms of
ownership develop side by side," thus providing the principle of
public ownership as the mainstay of economic development with a new
interpretation.</P>
      <P>The report acknowledged the spirit of Deng Xiaoping Theory in the
sphere of economic reform, and a new wave of economic development can
be expected, Xu added.</P>
      <P>But he criticized Jiang's report as being too conservative on the
question of political reform. It asserts only that "progress is
continuing" without mentioning specific details, Xu said.</P>
      <P>In the Chinese mainland, the Communists claim to be representing
the people, while in fact they are replacing the people; and the so
called government "of the people" is in fact the rule "of the party,"
he added.</P>
      <P>Jiang's interpretation of political reform, said Xu, is
impressive in appearance but not in substance, and except there is an
innovative attempt to introduce "administration according to law,"
basically any initiatives in this regard are tantamount to treading
water.</P>
      <P>In order to promote the overall development of mainland China,
Beijing should abandon its conservative line toward political reform
in the process of implementing the policies outlined at the recently
concluded 15th congress, Xu recommended.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  7 (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Wrong Data on the height of a mountain may
be behind the crash of two F-5E jet fighters on Sept. 30 in eastern
Taiwan, a preliminary investigation has shown.</P>
      <P>Huang Hsien-jung, commander-in-chief of the Republic of China Air
Force, said Tuesday that when the accident at Mount Hotien happened,
the jet fighters were flying at 1,002 feet, much higher than the
previous estimate of 650 feet.</P>
      <P>Mount Hotien, in the eastern county of Hualien, is listed as
being 850 feet high in the military's data. A survey following the
crash, however, showed that the mountain actually has a height of
1,200 feet.</P>
      <P>An F-5E and a twin-seater F-5F crashed into Mount Hotien on Sept.
30, claiming the lives of three pilots. Air Force Headquarters ruled
out the possibility that the two fighters collided with each other,
saying that with weather conditions causing poor visibility, the
pilots might have fatally misjudged the mountain's height.</P>
      <P>The new information reveals that the wrong data on the height of
the mountain may have led to the three deaths. Because of poor
visibility at that time, the pilots were flying by instruments at
1,002 feet and never suspected they could crash into a mountain
listed as 850 feet high.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Representative in the
United Kingdom Eugene Chien and former British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher on Monday jointly cut a cake to kick off a party
celebrating the National Day of the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>More than 400 guests, including ROC officials, Taiwan
businessmen, British legislators and officials, and foreign envoys
stationed in London, took part in the party held at Grosvenor House
Hotel on Monday night.</P>
      <P>Chien noted that Taiwan has made great strides in political
democratization and economic liberalization since the lifting of
martial law in 1987. ROC-British relations have been growing closer
since then, he said, citing the increasing number of Taiwan students
pursuing higher education in Britain and the rise in investment
projects there made by Taiwan businessmen.</P>
      <P>Chien told the guests that he will soon step down from his
current position and return to Taipei to serve as an advisor to the
National Security Council, but that he will also continue his efforts
to promote ROC-British ties while in Taipei.</P>
      <P>In addition to expressing her congratulations to the ROC on its
National Day, which is commonly called "Double Tenth Day" since it
falls on October 10, Thatcher praised Chien's significant
contributions to the promotion of bilateral ties between the ROC and
Britain during his four-year tenure.</P>
      <P>Tom Cox, chief of the British-Taiwan Parliamentary Group, said
that the parliament will make more efforts to help improve the ROC's
diplomatic status in Britain and in the international community,
while another member of parliament, Martin O'Neil, said that the
parliament will continue its support for the ROC and promote the

    <HEADLINE>EXPORTS HIT NEW HIGH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  7  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's exports set a new single-month
high of US$10.87 billion in September, marking a 10.7 percent
year-on-year rise, while imports soared 26.3 percent to US$9.75
billion, the Ministry of Finance reported on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>As a result, Taiwan registered a trade surplus of US$1.12
billion, down 46.5 percent from that recorded in September 1996.
Nevertheless, it was the third time that the monthly trade surplus
managed to exceed the US$1 billion mark.</P>
      <P>Both the export and import growth rates for September were the
highest so far this year, according to ministry tallies.</P>
      <P>Hsu Kuo-chung, director of the ministry's Statistics Department,
attributed the significant export growth rate partly to the
depreciation of the New Taiwan dollar in recent months.</P>
      <P>Hsu optimistically predicted that the current export boom will
go on in the months ahead as the NT dollar's devaluation will
continue to benefit local export industries.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, Hsu pointed out, Taiwan will also benefit
from the recent currency crises in major Southeast Asian countries.
The expected economic slowdown in those countries due to their
currency crises is not expected to seriously affect Taiwan's export
trade because the region does not account for a large portion of the
island's total overseas sales. On the other hand, the depreciation
of Southeast Asian currencies will help reduce import costs for
local manaufacturers who have relied on the region for the supply of
raw materials.</P>
      <P>Judging from recent trade records, Hsu said Taiwan's
annual export growth rate will exceed 5 percent this year,
while its import growth rate will be 11 to 12 percent. With imports
growing faster than exports, Hsu said, Taiwan's trade surplus will
shrink to between US$7 billion and US$8 billion.</P>
      <P>According to ministry statistics, exports posted a 4.9 percent
gain in the first three quarters of this year, while imports surged
19.2 percent during the same nine-month period.</P>
      <P>"The sharp rise in imports mainly reflects brisk
domestic demand and robust production activities," Hsu
noted, adding that raw materials and production equipment
continued to form the bulk of imports and both registered
double-digit growth during the January-September period. "All these
figures indicate that our economy will continue to pick up
steam."</P>
      <P>On the export front, electronics, information technology and
communications remained the best-selling items in September and all
chalked up a 20 percent year-on-year gain.</P>
      <P>Exports to such major markets as the United States, Hong Kong,
Europe and Southeast Asia all posted gains in September, but sales
to Japan declined as compared with the eyar-earlier level.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO EXPAND ECONOMIC LINKS WITH ICELAND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>London,  Oct. 7 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung &amp; Lawrence Chu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Authorities in Iceland hope to expand their
island nation's economic relations with Taiwan by boosting trade and
tourism exchanges, an official at Taipei's representative office in
Denmark said.</P>
      <P>Chuo Chung-cheng, economic section director at the Taipei
Economic and Cultural Office in Copenhagen, said two-way trade
between Iceland and Taiwan totaled only US$21.37 million in 1996,
leaving what he called ample room for economic cooperation and
development between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Chou's responsibilities include overseeing Taiwan's economic
links with the Scandinavian nation as Taipei has not established a
representative office in Iceland.</P>
      <P>Chou also said Iceland imported some US$7.15 million worth of
goods from Taiwan last year, including bicycles, fishing nets,
automobile parts, computer components and automatic data processing
equipment.</P>
      <P>The country's major export items to Taiwan were seafood
products, including frozen fish, nonedible fish meat, shellfish,
crustaceans and caviar, he said.</P>
      <P>Although Iceland's population and trade are relatively small,
there is ample room for economic cooperation between the ROC and
Iceland, especially in the industrial and fishery sectors, he said.</P>
      <P>Chou cited the aluminum casting industry as an example for
potential bilateral cooperation.</P>
      <P>Iceland generates far more energy than it consumes and is
begining to produce aluminum, accordingly, Taiwan's aluminum casting
industries would be wise to seek cooperation opportunities in
Iceland, Chou said.</P>
      <P>The fishing industry of Iceland, which generates about 10
percent of gross national product, is another ideal field for joint
ventures. Taiwan fishermen would benefit from cooperation with
partners in Iceland, he added.</P>
      <P>Iceland's technological know-how in harnessing geothermal
energy is so advanced that the United Nations has established a
special university to train students from developing nations on
methods of harnessing the natural resources, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Taiwan could benefit from such technology as the island is also
rich in geothermal resources, Chou said.</P>
      <P>He also cited government statistics from Iceland which indicate
that 6,000 tourists from Taiwan have visited there since the
beginning of this year.</P>
      <P>The statistics shows that Taiwan tourists are being drawn to
Iceland in increasing numbers by the island's unique geographic
features, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PARAGUAY IMPORTS BETEL NUTS FROM TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Asuncion,  Oct.  7  (CNA)
(By L.K. Sheng and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Though there are fewer than 10,000
overseas Chinese in Paraguay, the fact that many of them are in the
import-export business has made Taiwan betel nuts easily available
here.</P>
      <P>The "Chinese chewing gum" was first brought from Taiwan to the
South American country about 12 years ago. It is said that chewing
the nuts can help relieve the homesickness of Chinese immigrants.</P>
      <P>Paraguay's monthly imports of the Taiwan product grew to a peak
of 60,000 nuts before gradually declining to around 35,000.</P>
      <P>Betel nut chewers are not limited to Taiwanese; they include
people from mainland China and Hong Kong. Even some Koreans and Arabs
who have dealings with Taiwanese have gotten hooked on the natural
stimulant.</P>
      <P>Overseas Chinese in Brazil and Argentina, who have had difficulty
in importing betel nuts, have had to rely on the resale of betel nuts
from Paraguay.</P>
      <P>Sources said that since betel nuts are not easy to keep fresh, a
shipment could go rotten if there is any delay in delivery or customs
clearance.</P>
      <P>With the high costs involved in importing betel nuts, their price
is also high. A box of 12 betel nuts can go for up to US$10, double
the market price in Taiwan. But in La Ciudad del Este, where Taiwan
businessmen converge, over 300 packs are sold some nights.</P>
      <P>Eyeing the possibility of high returns, overseas Chinese have
tried to grow betel palms in Paraguay. The nuts from these trees have
a taste similar to those from palms in Taiwan, according to some who
have tried both.</P>
      <P>The limited number of betel palms in Paraguay is insufficient to
meet the demand here. If the number of betel nut consumers grows,
however, the trees could become part of the diversification of
Paraguay's agriculture.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MILITARY FACILITIES MOVED UNDERGROUND TO AVOID MAINLAND ATTACK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 7 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The majority of Taiwan's military facilities
and weapons depots have been moved underground to avoid a possible
mainland Chinese attack, the Ministry of National Defense (MND)
reported on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The ministry was commenting on foreign wire service reports that
eight of mainland China's missile bases currently target Taiwan and
its major offshore islands.</P>
      <P>Military spokesman Gen. Kung Fan-ding told a news conference that
the eight missile bases are only part of mainland China's overall
missile deployment and that although its missiles are usually
deployed against specific neighboring countries, they can be easily
adjusted to aim at new targets. Kung also pointed out that Taiwan is
within range of all types of strategic and tactical missiles deployed
by mainland China.</P>
      <P>In the face of mainland China's mounting military threat, Kung
said the ROC military has moved most of its installations and
arsenals underground to minimize any possible war damage.</P>
      <P>The military is also using separation and camouflage strategies
to hide or disguise its facilities and installations, the general
added.</P>
      <P>He said the MND has no knowledge about a US defense report which
predicts that mainland China will have the capacity to produce 1,000
ballistic missiles in 10 years' time.</P>
      <P>"We will keep a close watch on these developments," Kung said,
adding that a country's missile production capabilities hinge on its
technological level, economic strength and budget distribution.</P>
      <P>Commenting on a US naval report that mainland China is currently
upgrading six types of its warplanes and expects to achieve air
supremacy over Taiwan in eight years, Kung said airborne combat
capabilities rely not only on the performance of the planes
themselves but also on the weaponry and radar systems installed on
the aircraft, as well as on the command, control, communications and
intelligence-gathering abilities of all those involved in operating
the planes. "A country's airborne combat capabilities are not weighed
solely by the number of warplanes it can deploy."</P>
      <P>Kung stressed that Taiwan has no intention of engaging in an arms
race with mainland China. "The ultimate goal of our military build-up
plan is to construct an elite deterrent force," he emphasized.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Defense Minister Chiang Chung-ling told lawmakers on
Tuesday that the air force is studying a request by the state-run
Aerospace Industry Development Corp. to postpone the delivery of the
country's locally manufactured Ching-kuo indigenous defense fighters
for one year.</P>
      <P>Chiang further said the government's plan to trim the country's
armed forces to 400,000 is an appropriate goal. Under this plan, the
number of people in uniform will form only 1.82 percent of Taiwan's
total population, lower, for example, than Israel's 3.058 percent.</P>

high-ranking Singapore official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Singapore's Minister for Trade and Industry Lee Yock Suan made
the assertion in his keynote address at the opening ceremony of the
mammoth Comdex Asia '97 exhibition here.</P>
      <P>He said the Asia-Pacific IT market is growing at 35 percent per
annum. Last year, the Asia-Pacific region accounted for 24 percent of
the world's US$610 billion IT market, behind Western Europe at 27
percent and the United States at 42 percent, he added.</P>
      <P>"By the Year 2000," he predicted, "the Asia-Pacific is expected
to overtake Europe as the world's second largest IT market after the
USA."</P>
      <P>Governments and businesses in the region are eager to harness IT
to boost their economic competitiveness, he said.</P>
      <P>The Asia-Pacific region is fast emerging as an IT powerhouse. In
1995, six of the top 10 IT exporters were from this region. Together,
they produced 58 percent of global IT products, he said.</P>
      <P>With the tremendous growth potential of IT, Lee said, many
Asia-Pacific countries have ambitious plans to develop their IT
industries and infrastructure.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA THREATENS TO WALK AWAY FROM GLOBAL WARMING SUMMIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra, Oct. 7 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia has threatened to walk away from
an international summit meeting on global warming in Kyoto, Japan in
December and refuse to sign any related treaty that would cost jobs
in the Down Under.</P>
      <P>In his strongest message on the subject to date, Prime Minister
John Howard said Monday that Australia is prepared to walk away from
the Kyoto climate-change summit on December 1 because of tough
proposals by the United States, European Union (EU) and Japan.</P>
      <P>The Japanese proposal demands that Australia cut greenhouse gas
emissions by 1.8 percent by the year 2012, based on 1990 levels,
which is considerably less onerous than the EU target of a 15 percent
reduction by all industrialized countries.</P>
      <P>"There is a call that Australia's growing economy be burdened
with a new, unrealistic and unfair speed limit upon growth," Howard
told the Australian Chamber of Manufacturers in Melbourne on Monday.</P>
      <P>"The government is not prepared to sign on to any agreement at
Kyoto unless it is fair and unless we are confident the Australian
community can achieve any commitments we undertake. Australia cannot
sign up to proposals that would lead to the export of jobs and our
energy efficient minerals and metals processing industries," Howard
said.</P>
      <P>Australia wants each country to negotiate its own greenhouse gas
emission target based on national circumstances, including its level
of fossil-fuel dependence.</P>
      <P>Howard said meeting the EU or Japanese targets is "simply not
achievable without enormous economic costs for Australia."</P>
      <P>But greenhouse groups and foreign economists claim Australia
could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 20 percent
without causing significant economic hardship.</P>
      <P>The United States, considered to be the key player, is finalizing
its climate-change target.</P>

      <P>"We in Australia think that financial markets work best when they

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Donald Phillips, assistant to the United
States Trade Representative, on Tuesday urged Taiwan to support the
liberalization of the electronic business and agricultural
biotechnology industries.</P>
      <P>Phillips made the request while calling on ROC Vice Economics
Minister Lin Yi-fu. He arrived here on Monday for a one-day visit
seeking ROC support at a ministerial meeting of the Asia Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum which will take place in November.</P>
      <P>The US official said that with the expanding development of the
Internet, a worldwide information and telecommunications network,
trade and commercial activities on the Internet -- commonly defined
as electronic business -- are expected to play a key role in the
world's economic development during the 21st century.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, Phillips voiced the US hope that a comprehensive
package aimed at promoting tariff-free global electronic trade can be
raised at the upcoming APEC conference.</P>
      <P>He also conveyed Washington's hope that Taiwan, one of the 18
APEC member-countries, will raise the issue of the importance of
biotechnology in the agricultural industry at the APEC meeting, which
will be held in Tokyo.</P>
      <P>According to Phillips, the US also hopes that Taiwan will lend
its support to the liberalization of the chemistry, medical equipment
and service sectors, the automobile industry, the communication and
information technology industry, the energy industry, the
environmental protection industry and the timber industry.</P>
      <P>Sources at the Ministry of Economic Affairs said that Taiwan has
agreed to support the issue of electronic trade, as well as reaching
a consensus with the US on the liberalization of the environmental
protection sector.</P>
      <P>Phillips will leave Taiwan on Tuesday for a tour of seven other
Asian APEC economies, including Singapore, Thailand, Macau and Japan,
to seek their support.</P>
      <P>The 18 APEC members are Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile,
mainland China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New
Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea,

(By Debbie Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two maintenance workers have been reported
missing following an explosion on the Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC)
oil tanker Chang Yun at around 9:30 a.m. Tuesday just outside the
southern Taiwan port of Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>The explosion ignited a blaze which took nearly five hours to
bring under control and caused extensive damage to the tanker. None
of the 22 crew and 11 other maintenance workers aboard were injured,
according to a CPC spokesman.</P>
      <P>The cause of the blast was not immediately known and an
investigation is under way, said CPC Deputy General Manager Chiu
Chi-hsiung, who added that the accident is unlikely to affect CPC's
crude oil imports or its domestic supplies of oil products.</P>
      <P>Although the Chang Yun's cargo of crude oil had been unloaded
days before the vessel underwent routine checks and maintenance, the
explosion is causing a certain degree of environmental damage, as
residual crude can be seen leaking into the surrounding water.</P>
      <P>The 220,000-ton tanker, operated by Yangming Marine Transport,
was launched in 1981 and the CPC may now decide to retire the 16-year
old carrier, according to Chiu.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LOCAL PRESS COMMENT ON GOVERNMENT'S DEFENSE OF CURRENCY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 7 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The following are excerpts from an editorial
carried in Tuesday's edition of local English-language daily the
China News.</P>
      <P>Market Forces Cannot be Denied</P>
      <P>The government has made an honorable... gesture by offering its
help to Southeast Asian economies beset by currency crises and
general economic problems.</P>
      <P>But... Taiwan's government should refrain from adopting the kind
of rhetoric that Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has
brought into vogue. Speculators are not the prime cause of Southeast
Asia's economic woes at present and neither are they the main forces
applying pressure on the NT dollar.</P>
      <P>The first myth that needs clearing up is one which holds that
huge foreign currency reserves are all that is needed to prop up a
currency.</P>
      <P>A week of attacks like the one experienced last Friday -- when
US$1.2 billion was spent in one day by the (Central Bank of China) --
and (Taiwan's US$85 billion) foreign exchange reserves start to look
less than impregnable.</P>
      <P>This bleak scenario worsens when it is considered that no one...
will come to Taiwan's aid if those reserves eventually dry up. The
International Monetary Fund (of which Taiwan is not a member), will
certainly not throw the island a lifeline the way it did with
Thailand.</P>
      <P>The second misconception needing to be addressed is that a
devalued currency is a sign of weakness in an economy and should be
avoided at all costs.</P>
      <P>Chained to a currency that is so much more expensive to buy than
its Southeast Asian export-oriented rivals, prices for Taiwan
products in the world's major consumer markets will be unattractive.</P>
      <P>...they (Southeast Asian states) were wrapped up in the belief
that a greenback-linked currency is a good currency. As a result,
many were caught off-guard by changing market forces, having grown
comfortable with the assurance of stable exchange rates. Taiwan needs
to realize... that it cannot insulate itself forever from world
currency trends through a de facto link to the US dollar.</P>
      <P>To be sure, the people likely to be worst affected by the
devaluation are those who have been lulled into a false sense of
security and have not bothered to plan strategically.</P>
      <P>As long as the basics are sound, then Taiwan has nothing to worry
about.</P>

      <P>Officials from Taiwan and Malaysia met
Tuesday in Taipei for talks on easing aviation restrictions and
gradually liberalizing mutual controls based on existing frameworks
in order to reach an "open sky" goal.</P>
      <P>After a fruitful one-day discussion, the two sides reached
consensus on completely liberalizing flight frameworks in both
countries, agreeing to allow Taiwan airline companies to fly to any
destination in Malaysia from any Taiwan airport, and vice versa.</P>
      <P>The two sides also agreed that the number of flights between
Taiwan and Malaysia will be unlimited and that the number of
cross-continental extension flights will initially be increased to 12
per week. These weekly extension flights will be increased to 14 in
1998 and further increased to 17 in 1999, according to an official
from Taiwan's Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA).</P>
      <P>Another meeting will be held before the end of 1999 to review the
progress of the cooperative agreement and if all goes smoothly, the
two sides may then consider completely opening their skies to each
other, the official said.</P>
      <P>From the point of view of local airlines, Tuesday's discussion
will result in added flights to Malaysia for China Airlines and EVA
Airways, the two Taiwan airline companies which operate international
flight services, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S POPULATION AGING FAST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 7 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's population, which currently stands
at over 21 million, is aging fast, official statistics show.</P>
      <P>A nation is considered an aged society when more than 7 percent
of its people are over 65 years old, according to criteria set by the
United Nations. Taiwan has been an aging society since 1993, when 7.1
percent of its population exceeded 65 years of age.</P>
      <P>In 1986, those over 65 made up 5.22 percent of the Taiwan
population, a percentage which had risen to 6.16 percent in 1990, 7.1
percent in 1993 and 7.6 percent in 1995. It will grow even faster in
the 21st century, manpower researchers at the Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD) forecast.</P>
      <P>The researchers said the aging of Taiwan's population has
occurred faster than in many other countries, due principally to the
post-World War II baby boom and the drastic fall in birth rates in
recent years.</P>
      <P>In addition, because more and more women today are entering the
job market and in order to have more leisure time, many married
couples now prefer to have fewer children or no children at all.</P>
      <P>Improvements in living standards and better medical care now mean
that the average life-span in Taiwan has been steadily increasing
during the past decade. Recently released statistics indicate that
average life expectancy here has now reached, 71.81 years for men and
77.76 for women.</P>
      <P>This figure, although lower than the 79 years a Japanese person
can expect to live, is still among the highest in Asia, representing
an increase of more than 25 years since 1945.</P>
      <P>A CEPD estimate indicates that the increase in the number of
people aged 65 or over will be around 55,000 annually from 1996 to
2000, comprising 8.4 percent of the population. From 2010 to 2025,
this annual increase will jump to 124,000, or roughly 16.5 percent of
the population.</P>
      <P>At present, one in every nine people in Taiwan is over 65, but by
2025, the ratio is expected to be one in five of the population. This
means that while each citizen over 65 is currently being supported by
eight working persons, by 2025, only four working people will have to
provide support for one senior citizen, the CEPD predicted.</P>
      <P>The increasing average life-span also means there will be more
centenarians in Taiwan in the next century. There are currently 583
people in Taiwan who are over 100 years old, but this number will
increase to over 1,000 by 2004 and exceed 5,000 by 2030, according to
CEPD estimates.

    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China, which in past decades was at
the forefront of the global struggle for decolonization, is today
itself a colonial power, according to a report to the United Nations
in Geneva on Monday.</P>
      <P>The report from the international Mission Investigating
Colonialism in Tibet, which visited Tibet, Nepal and India in April
and May this year, analyzes for the first time the criteria of
colonialism and examines mainland China's rule in Tibet. The report
concludes that Tibet displays all the characteristics of a colonial
territory.</P>
      <P>"Not only is the form of administration and the use of the
military to suppress dissent typical of colonial rule, but all of
China's policies on culture, language, development and the
undercurrents of racism are so obviously colonial," according to
Prof. Cees Flinterman, one of the mission members. He also stated
that the population transfer of mainland Chinese into Tibet, a key
element of colonialism in the past, is today threatening the very
survival of the Tibetan people.</P>

      <P>He said that medical and food supplies are being flown in to

    <DATELINE>Geneva,  Oct.  7  (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Trade friction between the US and South
Korea has escalated as Seoul warned that it would file a complaint
with the Geneva-based World Trade Organization (WTO) if Washington
imposes sanctions over car imports, according to reports from the
world trade body on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The threat came after the US put South Korea on a priority list
for possible sanctions within the next 18 months unless Seoul removes
alleged car trade barriers.</P>
      <P>Seoul claims that a decision by the US to impose sanctions
unilaterally under its "Super 301" trade provisions will violate WTO
rules. But the Seoul Foreign Ministry expressed optimism that the
issue is likely to be solved through negotiations over the next 18
months. Other recent trade disputes, including telecom equipment and
protection of intellectual property rights, have already been solved.</P>
      <P>South Korea is trying to reach a fair compromise on the car issue
"amid the ever-rising trade deficit with the US and difficult
domestic economic conditions," the WTO report said.</P>
      <P>The US complains that tariffs combined with complex customs and
testing procedures limit US car sales to less than 1 percent of the
Korean car market, Asia's second-largest. Total foreign car sales
amount to 1.5 percent of the market.</P>
      <P>The Korean government offered in recent negotiations to ease
import procedures, but said it could not unilaterally agree to a US
demand to lower the tariff on imported cars to 2.5 percent from 8
percent because this needed parliamentary approval.</P>
      <P>Although Korea agreed in 1995 to impose a uniform tax on domestic
and foreign cars, Korean vehicles still enjoy a price advantage
because the taxes are imposed on a higher basic rate for foreign cars
due to the tariff.</P>
      <P>Seoul says that foreign car sales have remained sluggish, despite
the 1995 accord that was meant to open the market, because an
economic slowdown has resulted in a big fall in domestic car sales.</P>
      <P>Some Korean MPs accuse the US of trying to destabilize the Korean
car industry at a time when it is already suffering severe problems,
with the nation's third-largest carmaker, Kia, on the brink of
collapse.</P>

      <P>Jiang's upcoming state visit to Washington in late October has
caused much concern here in Taipei. Hau Lung-bin, legislator of the
opposition New Party, demanded Taipei authorities be well prepared
for how the Clinton-Jiang summit's dealings with the "Taiwan problem"
could affect the island, so that Taipei's interests won't be damaged.</P>
      <P>In response to Hau's question, Siew said, "We don't think there
is any 'Taiwan problem.' There is only the 'Taiwan Strait problem,'
which is the key to the security and stability of the whole region.
Therefore, we hope it is Washington's understanding that the security
of the whole region should be the subject of the summit."</P>
      <P>Siew stressed Taipei has informed Washington through various
channels that the United States should not engage mainland China at
the expense of the interests between Taipei and Washington, adding
that Washington has expressed repeatedly that the United States won't
do so.</P>
      <P>"Washington's policy toward the Republic of China is legally
bound by the Taiwan Relations Act. Washington should adhere to the
Taiwan Relations Act and other commitments to Taipei," Siew added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEWLY-DEVELOPED NEURAL NET ICS SAID QUICKER AND CHEAPER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  8  (CNA)
(By Debbie Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A set of three neural net chips newly
developed by a company in the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park
can reportedly help some applications run up to 100 times faster and
yet will cost less than chips from Intel.</P>
      <P>The neural net ICs -- NN1, NN2 and NN3 -- developed by Elan
Microelectronics Corp. (EMC) have been successfully used in
fingerprint identification systems, where they have worked 100 times
faster than other models, according to EMC President Yeh I-hau.</P>
      <P>Assisted by the Hsinchu Park Administration's Innovative
High-Tech R&amp;D Project, EMC collaborated with Startek Engineering
Corp., another Hsinchu-based company that produces fingerprint
identification and other security systems, to develop the "faster and
cheaper" identification chips.</P>
      <P>The newly developed ICs, said Yeh, have more neurals and neural
weights (memory chips responsible for transmitting signals among
neurals), making them capable of responding and calculating faster
and giving them greater fault tolerance capacities.</P>
      <P>The neural net chips would also work well in a wide range of
applications, including automobile electronic locks, imaging
identification, robotic arms, and other door security systems, Yeh
noted.</P>
      <P>Like the rest of the companies in Hsinchu Park, more than
one-third of EMC's staff are holders of master degrees or higher. A
total of 80 percent of EMC's 150 employees are working in research
and development.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MORE SERIOUS ATTITUDE SHOULD BE TAKEN IN OPENING CROSS-STRAIT DEADLOCK</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The two sides across the Taiwan Strait --
Taiwan and mainland China -- should start to seriously think over the
problems that will emerge following the resumption of cross-strait
talks, a Taiwan heavyweight in mainland affairs has said.</P>
      <P>Chiao Jen-ho, secretary-general and vice chairperson of the
semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), made the remarks on
Tuesday at a conference on cross-strait relations also attended by Wu
An-chia, vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), and
several scholars in the field.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China authorities founded the SEF six years ago
to deal with cross-strait exchanges in the absence of official links.</P>
      <P>Chiao stressed that now is still not the best moment for the two
sides to talk about disputed political issues, adding that he thinks
Beijing should make more efforts to gain the trust of Taiwan people,
while Taipei should seriously prepare topics for the talks, which
could be helpful for the further development of cross-strait links.</P>
      <P>Wu said that his council is already engaged in drawing up
timetables and issues for cross-strait talks under the government's
principles for developing Taipei-Beijing relations, which he said
include enhancing cross-strait exchanges and conducting dialogues
practically.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 8 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>King Mswati III of Swaziland reaffirmed his
commitment to the Republic of China here on Wednesday, saying that
even though Swaziland's closest neighbor -- South Africa -- will
switch diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing later this year,
his country will continue to strengthen its relationship with the
ROC.</P>
      <P>The king made the statement at a news conference which marked the
end of a six-day state visit to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Mswati told the press that during his stay in Taiwan, he
discussed with President Lee Teng-hui several cooperative projects
which are expected to bear fruit in the near future.</P>
      <P>He also said South Africa's imminent switch of diplomatic
allegiance will not affect Swaziland's longstanding relations with
the ROC, even though Swaziland maintains close tariff and trade ties
with South Africa. "Pretoria cannot represent all southern African
countries and is not in a position to decide which countries
Swaziland should recognize."</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Mswati and President Lee signed a joint
communique at the Presidential Office, reaffirming their commitment
to further reinforcing bilateral cooperative ties.</P>
      <P>The communique said the two leaders have exchanged views on the
general world situation and have discussed many possible bilateral
cooperative projects, adding that the ministers of foreign affairs of
the two countries will sign a formal agreement to define the scope of
the various cooperative projects.</P>
      <P>Mswati said in the communique that he was impressed by the ROC's
progress in economic development and political democratization. He
also expressed his gratitude for all the assistance the ROC has
extended to his country in agricultural development, small- and
medium-sized enterprises, infrastructure construction, medical
services and other related fields over the years.</P>
      <P>The Swazi king also reaffirmed his country's unswerving support
for the ROC's bid to rejoin the UN and other major international
organizations, saying he is convinced that the ROC can make even
greater contributions to world peace and prosperity if it is given
the opportunity to take part in major world organizations and
activities.</P>
      <P>Mswati, who had voiced his support for the ROC's bid to rejoin
the United Nations in a speech to the UN General Assembly debate
before coming to Taipei, said he thinks the ROC should continue to
seek a seat in the UN so that its voice can be heard in the
international community.</P>
      <P>For his part, President Lee said in the communique that the ROC
appreciates Swaziland's firm support for the ROC's stance in the
world arena. He also promised that the ROC will continue to assist
the southern African kingdom with its economic development.</P>
      <P>Following the press conference, President Lee presided over a
military ceremony to bid farewell to the king, who is scheduled to
travel to the Scottish capital of Edinburgh, where he will attend an
annual summit of the British Commonwealth of Nations.</P>
      <P>Prior to his departure, Mswati viewed a rehearsal of
a variety of dancing and acrobatic performances to be given on Oct.
10 to celebrate the ROC's Double Ten National Day.</P>
      <P>Mswati arrived in Taipei last Friday. While here, he underwent a
physical checkup at National Taiwan University Hospital.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TSMC BECOMES FIRST TAIWAN FIRM TO BE LISTED ON NYSE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  Oct. 7 (CNA)
(By Jennifer Huang &amp; Debbie Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp.
(TSMC), the world's largest semiconductor foundry service company,
will be formally listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on
Wednesday (US time), sources from Wall Street reported on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The listing makes TSMC the first Taiwan company to offer shares
on the NYSE in the prestigious stock market's 205-year history and
also the first microchip processor in Asia ever to receive approval
for listing on the NYSE, the sources noted.</P>
      <P>Some 130 million shares of TSMC stocks released through American
Deposit Receipts (ADR) by Dutch electronics group Philips, one of
major share holders of TSMC, will be offered for trading.
Underwriters of the stocks will include Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sach
and Robertson Stephen.</P>
      <P>The stocks, to be listed as TSM, are expected to see an opening
price of US$25.5 per share, said the sources who preferred to remain
anonymous.</P>
      <P>If all TSM stocks sell out smoothly, Philips' shares in TSMC will
be reduced from 31 percent to 29.5 percent. In a recent major move,
Philips announced the release of one billion TSMC shares, in a drive
to raise money to help finance other parts of its worldwide
operations.</P>
      <P>To welcome TSMC's joining the world's largest stock market, NYSE
executives will host a reception on the first day of listing in honor
of TSMC Chairman Chang Chung-mo and other officials. Wu Tzu-dan,
director of Taiwan's Economic and Cultural Representative Office in
New York, will also be present at the reception.</P>
      <P>The NYSE currently lists more than 3,000 companies, only 340 of
which are foreign corporations. Canadian companies top the foreign
list with 62. By comparison, eight mainland Chinese companies have
been approved to be listed since 1993, and nine from Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>According to NYSE regulations, any foreign company applying for
NYSE listing must have accumulated pre-tax business turnover
exceeding US$1 billion during the last three years, with annual
turnover of no less than US$250 million during the period.</P>
      <P>In addition, foreign companies must have global assets reaching
US$1 billion and the value of its publicly-issued corporation stocks
must not be lower than US$1 billion. It should have more than 5,000
shareholders and the volume of the shares not concentrated (SNC)
should total at least 2.5 billion.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US SHOULD CONSIDER SELLING TAIWAN SUBMARINES: US THINK TANK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  7  (CNA)
(By Bill Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States should revise its
long-standing refusal to sell Taiwan conventional submarines or at
least should not stand in the way of other countries, such as Russia
and the Netherlands, trying to sell the island submarines in view of
Beijing's efforts to acquire supersonic anti-ship missiles, an expert
at the Heritage Foundation said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Richard Fisher, a senior policy analyst at the conservative think
tank, told a Heritage Foundation panel discussion that the mainland
Chinese navy is buying from Russia the supersonic Moskit anti-ship
missiles to which ships not covered by the US AEGIS system are
vulnerable.</P>
      <P>In addition, Fisher said, Beijing is reportedly purchasing the
even more frightening Yakhont anti-ship cruise missile, which is now
just entering production in Russia. The Yakhont has a wider range
than the Moskit and can be fitted into more ships and air platforms.</P>
      <P>Fisher said that Beijing's acquisition of these supersonic
missiles puts greater pressure on the United States not only to
develop better anti-ship defenses, such as laser-based anti-missile
defenses for ships, but also to consider revising its long-standing
refusal to sell submarines to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"If we cannot develop adequate defenses to go after these new
missiles," he went on, "then we have to consider selling Taiwan the
ability to go after the platforms carrying these missiles."</P>
      <P>He said that the United States should at least not stand in the
way of other countries trying to sell conventional submarines to
Taiwan or should even encourage other countries to sell Taiwan
submarines in order to deter the mainland navy's new missiles.</P>
      <P>Fisher warned that Beijing's increasing access to foreign weapons
and technology from Russia, Israel and Europe is posing a threat to
US interests in Asia.</P>
      <P>He said that Beijing has made it clear that it wants Taiwan
unified under its terms, wants to control the resources and sea lanes
in the South China Sea, wants to sell more weapons in the
international market and is increasingly uncomfortable with the US
security alliance network in Asia.</P>
      <P>If Beijing had a more modern and more effective military, he
said, it would use it to buttress its diplomatic and political
activities to achieve those goals. However, he added, it is clearly
in the US interest to sustain the survival of Taiwan's democracy and
freedom of the sea in the South China Sea, stem the sale of advanced
weapons to rogue states, and maintain America's powerful position in
Asia.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he said, the United States should take up the issue
with US friends and allies that are selling Beijing modern
technology. "If the US keeps this problem under the hat," he said,
"who is going to take our complaints seriously?"</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND CHINA MAY ATTACK US FORCES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct. 7 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China's acquisition of weapons
from Russia does not imply a serious threat to the United States, but
it does raise the specter of a Beijing emboldened enough to do
something very foolish, such as attacking Taiwan in a fit of pique, a
retired rear admiral of the US Navy said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a panel discussion held by the Heritage Foundation,
Eric McVadon expressed the fear that the mainland Chinese military,
with its newly acquired Russian weapons, may even launch missiles and
torpedoes at US aircraft carriers because of its frustration at US
intervention in the conflict between Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>McVadon said mainland China wants to obtain the capability to
cope with US weapons systems, but is having a difficult time
assimilating the foreign technology it acquires. For example, its
aircraft industry is still struggling to integrate Israeli, Russian
and European technologies into its J-10 indigenous fighter.</P>
      <P>In addition, it still lacks the capability of in-flight
refueling, while the Kilo-class submarines bought from Russia have
become a problem rather than a panacea for the mainland Chinese navy,
he said.</P>
      <P>In McVadon's view, although the mainland Chinese military still
has a long way to go to achieve modernization, the real concern is
what they can do to "make Taiwan kowtow, and to create confusion,
indecision, uncertainty and delay" among the military and political
leaderships in Washington and possibly in Tokyo.</P>
      <P>He believes that mainland China's acquisition of weapons is most
usefully, if not solely, measured in relation to its ability to
intimidate and defeat Taiwan and to deter, defeat or deflect US
intervention.</P>
      <P>"They want to be able to keep Taiwan under their thumb and to be
left alone to do so," McVadon said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>22 COUNTRIES VOICE SUPPORT FOR ROC'S UN BID AT UN DEBATE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New York, Oct. 7 (CNA)
(By K.C. Huang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A total of 22 countries lent their support
to the Republic of China's bid to rejoin the United Nations at this
year's UN General Assembly debate, which started on Sept. 22 and
ended on Oct. 7.</P>
      <P>Nineteen of those countries are diplomatic allies of the ROC,
while the other three -- Fiji, Jordan and Papua New Guinea -- are
not.</P>
      <P>This was the least support the ROC has received since it began
promoting its UN bid five years ago. In 1993, 24 countries gave
either explicit or indirect support for ROC UN representation. The
number increased to 26 in 1994, 29 in 1995 and declined slightly to
28 last year.</P>
      <P>Wu Tzu-dan, director general of the Taipei Economic and Cultural
Office in New York, said the number does not necessarily fully
reflect the effect of the ROC's recent promotional activities.
"Substance is more important," he said.</P>
      <P>Wu pointed out that after five years of effort, the ROC's UN bid
has become an attention-getting topic in the world body and that many
UN members have now come to understand the issue and have expressed
sympathy for the ROC's position. Looked at from this angle, Wu said,
the ROC's UN drive has in fact made headway.</P>
      <P>The ROC currently has 30 diplomatic allies, but four of them --
the Holy See, Nauru, Tonga and Tuvalu -- are not UN members.</P>
      <P>While most of its allies explicitly drummed up support for the
ROC's UN bid, several allies gave only veiled support or even
completely avoided the topic in their speeches to the General
Assembly debate this year.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, the last day of the debate session, three countries
voiced support for the ROC's UN bid.</P>
      <P>Kilroy Genia, Papua New Guinea's foreign minister, said he sees
no reason for countries around the world to reject direct contact
with Taiwan on economic and trade affairs.</P>
      <P>Genia lauded Taiwan as a vibrant, robust economy and trade
partner. He also urged Taipei and Beijing to resolve their
differences through negotiation in order to maintain peaceful
co-existence.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Alpian Allen, minister of foreign
affairs of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, appealed for world
recognition of Taiwan's contribution to global development.</P>
      <P>Allen said the people of Saint Vincent highly appreciate all the
assistance Taiwan has given to them over the years. He also expressed
his hope that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait will resume talks to
mend their differences.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Jean Mete-Yapende, minister of foreign affairs of the
Central African Republic, urged the UN to uphold the principle of
membership universality to facilitate the smooth proceeding of its
various work programs. However, he didn't specifically mention the
ROC's national title in his address.</P>
      <P>The minister of foreign affairs of the West African island nation
of Sao Tome and Principe, also an ROC ally, didn't address Tuesday's
General Assembly debate session as originally scheduled.</P>
      <P>The ROC lost its seat in the UN in 1971 when the world body
accepted the communist government in Beijing as the sole
representative of the Chinese people.</P>
      <P>The UN General Assembly's steering committee on Sept. 17 rejected
for a fifth straight year to consider the question of ROC
representation. This year's petition, signed by 14 of Taipei's
diplomatic allies, called for the re-examination of Resolution No.
2758, which expelled the ROC to make way for mainland China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WEI JINGSHENG BEST FOR NOBEL PEACE PRIZE: DAILY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Oct.  7 (CNA)
(By S.C. CHANG)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In its editorial, "Our Nobel nominee," The
Ottawa Citizen said Tuesday that mainland China's leading dissident
Wei Jingsheng deserves the Nobel Peace Prize.</P>
      <P>The influential Canadian newspaper praised Wei for his courage,
even in the face of continuing persecution, to defend his ideals. It
was referring to Wei's letters from the prison, titled "The Freedom
to Stand Alone," which challenged the repressive powers of Beijing's
leadership.</P>
      <P>His letters about Deng Xiaoping refer disdainfully (and
humorously) to the paramount leader as "the person who is currently
making the entire country read his selected writings," according to
the Citizen.</P>
      <P>Wei dismisses communist chieftains as "the incompetent generation
of headstrong old men" and as "degenerate old revolutionaries,"
descriptions unlikely to get him the early medical parole he has so
desperately sought, it added.</P>
      <P>His letters include long essays full of advice and simple common
sense, such as, "Every person has a share in the fate of his country;
one shouldn't think this is the duty of just a few," the editorial
pointed out.</P>
      <P>The world can make a clear statement about mainland China's
double standard on capitalist freedoms and personal freedoms for its
own citizens later this week when the Nobel Peace Prize is awarded,
the daily said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA IS WORRIED ABOUT LOSING EDUCATIONAL MART TO US, CANADA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct.  8  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia is worried about losing its
US$2.2 billion educational market in Asia to its major rivals -- the
United States and Canada -- because Independent Member of Parliament
Pauline Hanson has become the dampening contributor to one of the
country's lucrative sectors.</P>
      <P>Leading Australian universities and IDP (International
Development Program) Education Australia, a private company engaged
in recruiting international students for Australian schools, have
downgraded their estimates and warned for the first time that there
could be a serious drop in the number of foreign students to
Australia this year.</P>
      <P>IDP chief executive Denis Blight admitted that the Pauline
Hanson-inspired race debate was an "important contributor" to the
expected downturn.</P>
      <P>He told the IDP's Melbourne conference last week that early
warning signs were apparent despite the latest research showing 17
percent growth in the local industry from 1996 to 1997.</P>
      <P>The IDP's growth target of 89,000 overseas students studying in
Australia by the year 2000 will be very difficult to meet, he said.</P>
      <P>Up to early this year, Australia has attracted about 140,000
foreign students since the country started its educational export
program in the mid-1980s.</P>
      <P>The number of students from Taiwan alone is almost 8,000,
according to the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Canberra.</P>
      <P>Blight said Australia may be losing some of its educational
market share to the United States and Canada in such lucrative and
profitable markets as Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore.</P>
      <P>The educational exports show "a worsening trend in Taiwan," he
said.</P>
      <P>He also said that the IDP is predicting a sharp flattening of
growth in Malaysia and Thailand and a flattening in Hong Kong. Only
Indonesia was listed as a growth target country.</P>
      <P>The IDP said it was not possible to identify Australia-specific
factors behind the expected slump in its educational exports in major
markets in Asia.</P>
      <P>"However, it is very difficult to discount the possibility that
the debate associated with the activities of Pauline Hanson is an
important contributor. We conclude that Australian universities face
the prospect of a serious short-term slowing growth in international
student enrollments. Ambitious enrollment targets will be difficult
to meet," Blight said.</P>
      <P>The IDP's rival, the government-run Australian International
Education Foundation, recently dismissed concerns the race debate had
directly harmed the country's educational export industry.</P>
      <P>But the IDP said the damage done by the racial debate triggered
by Pauline Hanson was greater than expected because many parents from
Taiwan, Korea, Hong Kong and other Asian countries were worried about
sending their children to study in Australia.</P>
      <P>"Unless we take corrective action, we risk a shortfall in student
enrollments in the latter part of this year and in 1998," he said.</P>
      <P>The shortfall could mean a substantial slowing in the growth rate
or even a reduction in enrollment numbers compared to early 1997, he
said.</P>
      <P>In order to make up for the loss of students from Taiwan, Korea,
Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia, Australian universities are now
actively promoting themselves in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Mainland China's education minister is scheduled to visit
Australia on October 20, the first visit in 20 years by a senior
mainland educational official to the Down Under.</P>
      <P>The Australian Vice Chancellors Committee is negotiating with its
mainland Chinese counterpart -- the Chinese Educational Association
for International Exchange -- on a planned memorandum of
understanding (MOU).</P>
      <P>Educational officials said the MOU is aimed at substantially
improving educational export opportunities, staff and student
exchange and research links for Australia.</P>
      <P>The mass circulation newspaper The Australian on Wednesday quoted
Professor Kee Pookong of the Victoria University of Technology in
Melbourne as saying that Australia is well positioned to take
advantage of troubled relations between Beijing and Washington by
luring mainland Chinese students to the Down Under.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CURRENCY TURMOIL HAS SLIGHT IMPACT ON SINGAPORE ECONOMY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Oct. 8 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore's Finance Minister Hu Tsou-Daw
said in parliament on Tuesday that the region's currency troubles
will have only a "very small immediate impact" on the Singapore
economy, although growth might be affected next year if the problem
persists.</P>
      <P>The Singapore dollar's improved strength over regional currencies
will affect Singapore's export competitiveness only if the Malaysian
ringgit remains weak and even then, only a certain range of products
will be affected, he said.</P>
      <P>"Recent indicators show that the Singapore economy is on course
to attain a 6 to 7 percent growth in 1997. For 1998, however, growth
of total goods and services, particularly tourism, might be weaker,
reflecting slower growth and poorer business sentiment in the
regional economies," he told parliament.</P>
      <P>"In the longer term, the impact will depend on how quickly the
regional economies resume their normal growth," he added.</P>
      <P>The finance minister pointed out that Singapore has emerged
relatively unscathed from the currency crisis because of its strong
political and economic fundamentals.</P>
      <P>"We have high savings rates, substantial budget surpluses and
large foreign exchange reserves. We also have large current account
surpluses and strong inflows of direct foreign investment.</P>
      <P>"All these are the outcome of prudent fiscal and monetary
policies put in place over the years," he said.</P>
      <P>By October 3, the Singapore dollar had gained 28.9 percent
against the Thai baht, 39.2 percent against the Indonesian rupiah,
19.9 percent against the Malaysian ringgit, and 3.9 percent against
the German mark.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the Singapore dollar had lost 9.3 percent
against the US and Hong Kong currencies, 9.4 percent against the
Chinese renminbi and 4.6 percent against the Japanese yen.</P>
      <P>"Overall, the Singapore dollar has remained firm against its
trade-weighted basket of currencies," he said.</P>
      <P>Hu also reiterated that Singapore will continue with its policy
of allowing the gradual internationalization of the Singapore dollar.</P>
      <P>In line with this policy, Singapore last year increased foreign
banks' access to Singapore dollar loans by S$50 million, to S$200
million.</P>

    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Oct. 8 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore is hopeful the forest fires in
Indonesia that have shrouded the region in haze will be under control
soon and has suggested that ASEAN ministers meet when the present
crisis is over to discuss how to prevent a recurrence of the problem.</P>
      <P>Singapore's Environment Minister Yeo Cheow Tong told the
Singaporean parliament Tuesday that if the Indonesian government
translates its words into action, the problem could be overcome soon.</P>
      <P>He said he had been in daily telephone contact with his
Indonesian counterpart over the past few days.</P>
      <P>"Apart from registering our concerns with the Indonesian
authorities and urging them to take effective actions to curb the
haze problem, we have also offered our cooperation and assistance,"
he said.</P>
      <P>On Monday, he noted, the Singapore Defense Ministry had sent a
C-130 aircraft complete with crew and personnel, to release chemicals
into the air to help counter the haze in badly-hit areas.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the health effects of the haze, Yeo, who is also
Health Minister, said particles in the haze irritate the nose,
throat, airways, skin and eyes but that these "irritant effects" are
mild and posed no danger to the general population.</P>
      <P>As for the long-term effects of the haze, he said, Singaporeans
are "quite safe" because they have been exposed to it for only short
periods.</P>
      <P>The Pollution Standards Index, he said, had gone up beyond 100
into the "unhealthy" range on only eight occasions this year, and
even then for only short periods.</P>
      <P>"It's unhealthy only if you are exposed for 24 hours over many,
many years," he said, citing studies done in the United States.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAJOR WAFER SUPPLIER TO FORM HI-TECH FIRE-FIGHTING BRIGADE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  8 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A major wafer supplier in Taiwan announced
on Wednesday that it will invest NT$1 billion (US$34.84 million) to
form a high technology fire-fighting brigade so that it will never
experience another fire incident like the one it suffered earlier
this month.</P>
      <P>Robert Tsao, chairman of United Microelectronics Corp. (UMC),
made the remarks at a news conference following a fire which broke
out on Oct. 2 in a sealed fabrication building belonging to United
Integrated Circuit Corp. (UICC), a UMC joint venture company.</P>
      <P>Tsao said the fire was not extinguished completely until 5:00
a.m. on Oct. 5, after the fire had raged uncontrollably in the sealed
facility for almost 36 hours, totally destroying the equipment
inside.</P>
      <P>He said the main factor which resulted in such heavy damage was
thick smoke that prevented fire fighters from reaching the flames.</P>
      <P>The UMC chairman said that the companies belonging to the UMC
Group have therefore decided to work together to raise the funds
necessary to form a specialized fire-fighting brigade, and will, in
the near future, explore the use of the most advanced fire-fighting
technology and equipment, especially the technology which allows
fire-fighters to tackle blazes with high temperatures and heavy smoke
burning out of control in sealed areas.</P>
      <P>Tsao said the fire has resulted in losses to UICC estimated at
NT$12 billion (US$418 million), but added that because the company
is heavily insured, financial losses will be minimal.</P>
      <P>Although full reconstruction of the facility will take at least
one year, he said profit targets of UMC and UICC will be unaffected.</P>
      <P>While awaiting the reconstruction of the UICC facility, the UMC
Fab III, United Semiconductor Corp. (USC), and Nanya Technology Corp.
will provide 15,000 eight-inch wafers per month to UICC, enabling the
company to fulfill its commitments to its joint venture partners and
foundry customers over the next year.</P>
      <P>Tsao stressed that the fire will not affect the determination of
UMC to invest locally. On the contrary, to make up for its losses, it
will accelerate the pace of new wafer plant construction and its plan
to move into the Tainan Science-based Industrial Park will remain
unchanged.</P>
      <P>The UMC Group will complete the construction of six wafer
manufacturing facilities by 2000 with a monthly production capacity
of 200,000 wafers and monthly revenues reaching NT$10 billion (US$348
million).</P>
      <P>Tsao also announced that UMC will begin construction of an
eight-inch wafer plant in Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park by
the year's end, with a total investment of NT$35 billion (US$1.21
billion). The plant is expected to start production in May 1999, with
a full capacity of 40,000 wafers per month.</P>

      <P>Overseas Chinese and Australian
politicians and government officials who are friendly to the Republic

mainland China in order to realize "the dream of one reunited China."</P>
      <P>In her speech marking the Double Tenth National Day, Maggie Tien,
director-general of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in
Sydney, said: "We believe that our Australian friends will generously
assist in fostering the environment conducive to peaceful solution of
issues between the ROC and the PRC, such as having them work together
on international occasions as equal members of international
organizations."</P>
      <P>She also urged overseas Chinese to "make concerted efforts
towards ushering in the day of "one free and democratic China."</P>
      <P>Speaking to about 500 overseas Chinese representatives and
Australian friends at the Wentworth Hotel in downtown Sydney, Tien
said: "The dream of one reunited China can only come true under the
principles of freedom, democracy and equal wealth."</P>
      <P>She took the opportunity to call on mainland China "to face the
reality that China today is split into two political entities equally
exercising exclusive jurisdiction on two separate Chinese
territories, i.e. the mainland and Taiwan."</P>
      <P>She also asked China to "stop all the moves aimed at suffocating
Taiwan's international space and its efforts to make contributions to
our region and to the world."</P>
      <P>Tien said the Hong Kong model cannot be applied on Taiwan for the
eventual reunification with mainland China.</P>
      <P>"One can draw no parallel between Hong Kong and Taiwan and no way
can the so-called Hong Kong model be applied on Taiwan," because the
ROC has existed since the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen overthrew the Ching
Dynasty and set up the first republic in Asia in 1912.</P>
      <P>Tien said the price of founding the ROC was dear and the people
and government of the ROC will continue to safeguard their
hard-earned freedom and democracy along with other peace-loving and

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  8  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Police seized a record 800 kilograms of
amphetamine in a raid Wednesday afternoon.</P>
      <P>Police estimate that the amphetamine, in liquid form, was the
largest seizure of the illegal substance ever by law enforcement
authorities in Taiwan. It was estimated to have a street value of at
least NT$300 million (US$10.45 million).</P>
      <P>Police detained Yeh Tsou-fa in connection with the case and are
still tracking other two suspects who remain on the run.</P>
      <P>An initial investigation found that Yeh had opened a
button-making factory in Chunan township in Miaoli County, northern
Taiwan, as a cover for his illegal operation. He had stored the 800
kilograms of amphetamine in 10 large barrels and admitted to
distributing the drug throughout the northern part of the island in
plastic bottles.</P>
      <P>Yeh said that with the price of the drug rising recently, he had
sought to produce the substance himself along with other friends for
the large profits to be made.</P>
      <P>He denied that the liquefied amphetamine seized by police was
smuggled from the mainland. The authorities said that they are trying
to verify his story.</P>
      <P>Police officers were tipped recently that drug traffickers had
set up an amphetamine plant in Chunan, which culminated in
Wednesday's swoop on the plant. During the raid, they also seized
filtering equipment used in producing amphetamine and two remodeled
toy guns.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WTO LOGO TO BE UNVEILED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  Oct.  8  (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Renato Ruggiero, director-general of the
Geneva-based World Trade Organization (WTO), is to officially unveil
the logo for the global trade regulatory body on Thursday.</P>
      <P>"The adoption of an official logo by the World Trade Organization
is another step in establishing this unique institution on a firm and
lasting foundation. It is the visual representation of a dynamic
organization with a vital role to play in ensuring the continued and
rules-based expansion of trade worldwide," Ruggiero said.</P>
      <P>The design is adapted from the logo originally commissioned by
the Singapore government for the WTO's first ministerial conference
which was hosted by Singapore in December 1996. In April 1997, the
WTO General Council accepted Singapore's offer to transfer the logo
to the WTO along with ownership of its copyright.</P>
      <P>The original logo was created by Su Yeang Design, a
Singapore-based graphic arts company, and selected from over 200
entries in a competition held by the Singapore government. "A hint of
the globe is suggested by the six graphic arcs symbolizing the world
trade with member nations meeting to forge strategic alliances,"
according to Ms. Su Yeang. "Dynamism and optimism prevail as the
swirls integrate, encapsulating WTO's united spirit of promoting fair
and open trade."</P>
      <P>The unveiling ceremony will take place Thursday morning in the
reception area at WTO headquarters. Ambassador Celso Lafer of Brazil,
chairman of the WTO General Council, Ambassador Chak Mun See of
Singapore and Ms. Su Yeang will be present for the presentation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LOCAL PRESS COMMENT ON INCEPTION OF LOCAL-PRINTED AWSJ</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 8 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The following are excerpts from an editorial
carried in Wednesday's edition of local English-language daily The
China Post.</P>
      <P>A New Role Model for the Local News Media</P>
      <P>Local readers will see the birth of a third English-language
newspaper printed locally before the end of this year when the Asian
Wall Street Journal will begin printing in Taiwan. The Asian Wall
Street Journal (AWSJ)'s publication in Taipei, its seventh printing
site in the region ... will be significant in several major ways.</P>
      <P>One is that the publication here of the AWSJ will greatly benefit
the paper's local readers, as the move will make it possible for it
to reach subscribers and newsstand between 8:30 and 10:00 in the
morning. In other words, local subscribers will be able to read the
paper and get pertinent information at the start of their working
day.</P>
      <P>The AWSJ's publication here also could help Taiwan increase its
financial visibility in the region and the rest of the world. This is
because the paper, with its publication in Taiwan, will most likely
expand its editorial staff here to step up its coverage of this
island.</P>
      <P>In terms of editorial content, however, the presence of the AWSJ
can be expected to be a role model for the Taiwan press. The AWSJ,
since its first entering the Asian market 21 years ago, has been a
highly regarded newspaper in the region. The readers of the AWSJ are
especially impressed by the paper's investigative-type coverage of
news and its writing skills.</P>
      <P>Apparently it was the fact that the local media can now enjoy
full press freedoms that encouraged the AWSJ to reach the decision to
start its publication in Taiwan. Being able to print a publication in
an environment free of any political constraints is essential to the
flourishing of any news media, and it seems to be especially
significant to a newspaper like the Wall Street Journal group, which
has always held the principle of freedom as a basic value in
journalism.</P>
      <P>Being a member of the local media industry, The China Post was
pleased to help print and sell the AWSJ in Taiwan as its contracted
partner in this country. That the Post decided to render such
assistance to the AWSJ is because it believes that the increased role
of such a paper will be beneficial to the local media and Taiwan
society as a whole.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NORTH KOREA TO SEEK IMPROVED FOREIGN TIES AFTER KIM'S PROMOTION: EXPERT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 8 (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The world can expect to see some changes in
North Korea's foreign policy now that Kim Jong-Il has been named
general secretary of that country's ruling Workers Party, an expert
said here on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The appointment of Kim Jong-Il, son of former North Korean leader
Kim Il-Sung, on Wednesday ended a three-year power vacuum in the
party. He is expected to use his strengthened position to develop
relations with the outside world as part of efforts to improve the
communist country's deteriorating economic situation, said Lin
Chiu-shan, a member of the Control Yuan and an expert in North Korean
affairs.</P>
      <P>Kim, 55, has been serving as Pyongyang's supreme military
commander and de facto leader since his father's death in 1994.</P>
      <P>Lin said that with his promotion to the pinnacle of power, Kim
will now seek to enhance relations with arch-rival South Korea, the
United States and Japan. However, it will take some time for those
efforts to yield results, Lin added.</P>
      <P>Lin, who has visited North Korea every year since 1991, said that
Taiwan might be one of the targets for North Korea's foreign
relations initiative. Pyongyang will seek to promote trade,
investment and tourism exchanges with Taiwan as well as the expertise
Taiwan can provide in agricultural development, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT LEADERS IN URGENT MEETING TO SORT OUT FINANCIAL PROBLEMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 8 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew told Cabinet members in
charge of economic and financial affairs Wednesday to stabilize the
local currency while holding down soaring interest rates and boosting
the plunging bourse, according to a government spokesman.</P>
      <P>David Lee, director-general of the Government Information Office,
quoted Siew as depicting intervention by the Central Bank of China
(CBC) to prop up the value of the New Taiwan Dollar as "a right move"
during an urgent meeting called to address financial concerns sparked
by an assault against the local currency mounted by foreign
speculators.</P>
      <P>However, Lee said Siew also asked Finance Minister Paul Chiu to
keep a close eye on the bourse and take steps to consolidate the
stock market whenever it is disrupted by "irrational factors."</P>
      <P>Taiwan stocks have dropped sharply in the past two months with
the leading stock price index shedding more than 2,000 points, due in
part to attempts by the CBC to prop up the NT dollar by selling off
nearly US$ 5 billion over a two-week period. The result has been an
increase in the short-term interest rate of inter-bank loans and a
depleted cash market.</P>
      <P>Spectators' attack on the NT dollar followed a monetary crisis in
Southeast Asian countries which has seen the currencies of Thailand,
the Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia depreciate more than 20
percent one after another.</P>
      <P>It is for this reason, Lee said, that the premier has asked P. K.
Chiang , chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development, to closely monitor the effects of the Southeast Asian
financial crisis on Taiwan's economy, and to take precautionary
measures for protecting the island's economic development and
financial markets.</P>
      <P>Other ministers attending the meeting included Economics Minister
Wang Chih-kang, Justice Minister Liao Chen-hao and State Minister
Shirley Kuo. They touted Taiwan's healthy financial and economic
situation, which they said would exempt the island from the crisis
which has beset its Southeast Asian neighbors, according to Lee.</P>
      <P>In a related development, the Ministry of Finance announced a
five-point list of urgent measures to strengthen the bourse after the
meeting chaired by Premier Siew.</P>
      <P>Vice Minister of Finance Wu Chia-sheng told a news conference
Wednesday afternoon that the ministry intends to raise the ceiling on
the level of foreign investment in the local bourse after consulting
the CBC.</P>
      <P>The ministry also extended the maximum period for extending loans
of both money and stocks by bourse investors from the current six
months to one year, a measure aimed at easing fluctuations of the
stock market, according to Wu.</P>
      <P>Also to be relaxed is the time limit for prospective expatriate
stock investors to bring in capital, which will be extended from six
months after the date of approval to one year.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Finance vowed to speed up the procedure
for approving applications by foreign institutions to invest in the
local bourse as well as those by domestic institutions to raise money
from overseas sources.</P>
      <P>Review by the CBC would be waived for such applications involving
capital totaling less than US$50 million. However, the ceiling of
US$600 million on cases related to those applications will be
maintained under the new measures.</P>
      <P>Another shot in the arm announced by the ministry Wednesday is
the approval of two mutual funds with a combined capital of NT$13
billion, one each of which will be kept by Pan Asia Bank and the
First Commercial Bank.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER SIEW RESPONDS TO AMCHAM DRESSING-DOWN (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  9  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>No matter how alluring the potential of
unrestricted cross-strait trade and investment may be, economic
considerations can never override those of national security, Premier
Vincent Siew said in a speech to members of the American Chamber of
Commerce on Wednesday evening.</P>
      <P>Siew also said that Taiwan remains well on course to turn itself
into an Asia-Pacific regional operations center (APROC), and that "we
are highly optimistic about the outlook for the APROC plan."</P>
      <P>In a keynote speech to the AmCham-hosted dinner party marking the
ROC National Day which falls on Oct. 10, Siew responded to the
AmCham's recent 1997-98 Taiwan White Paper, which cited a number of
problem areas, by saying that Taiwan appreciates those comments.</P>
      <P>"We have studied them all with great care. Some we feel are well
justified, and some without sufficient ground," he said.</P>
      <P>As to AmCham's assertion in the white paper that the APROC plan
"is now seldom mentioned," and that "the beginning of the second
stage on July 1 this year passed virtually unnoticed," Siew politely
disagreed.</P>
      <P>"Fanfare or not, much of the essential groundwork of the plan has
been put in place," Siew pointed out, adding that well over half of
the requisite new laws have been passed, with nearly all regulatory
amendments already completed.</P>
      <P>Important sectors have been opened to foreign investment,
including the telecommunications, real estate, oil refining, and
power generation industries. The procedures for entry and exit have
been substantially simplified. Work permits are much easier to obtain
and the validations terms have been extended.</P>
      <P>Restrictions on capital movement have been greatly relaxed, with
critical ceilings raised to several times their previous levels.
Export processing zones have been transformed in line with the shift
to high-tech industry. Customs clearance time at seaports has been
slashed from seven days to four. The Kaohsiung Offshore Transshipment
Center is up and running, with vessels already sailing directly
across the Taiwan Strait, he noted.</P>
      <P>"Though we may not yet have gotten everything right, I do believe
there is a lot that we have gotten right, and much else very nearly
so," Siew said.</P>
      <P>"We are confident that basically our economy has a suitable
engine--well conducted and with plenty of power. We'll go on making
the needed adjustments, until that engine is running smoothly on all
cylinders, taking us to our APROC destination in the 21st century."</P>
      <P>On the AmCham white paper's accusation that Taiwan's tax rates
are high, Siew said the Executive Yuan has adopted a proposal to
integrate the business income tax with the individual income tax,
doing away with double taxation on dividends and cutting the income
tax burden on investors by 15 percent.</P>
      <P>The "two-in-one" tax policy, expected to come into effect next
year, plus the continuing economic liberalization, will undoubtedly
raise Taiwan's international competitiveness, he noted.</P>
      <P>On Taiwan's relations with archrival mainland China, Siew
stressed that no matter how alluring the potential gains of removing
all restrictions on cross-strait trade and investment may be,
economic considerations can never override the dictates of national
security.</P>
      <P>Up to now, he said, mainland China has refused to withdraw its
threat to use military force against Taiwan. "It has bullied and
schemed to keep our 21.6 million people from a presence on the
international stage in an effort to marginalize the ROC as one of its
provinces.</P>
      <P>"In such circumstances, how could our government agree to forging
free and unfettered economic links between us? How could we be said
to serve the best interests of our citizens if we were irresponsible
in such a way? But having said that, I believe that the state of
cross-strait relations is rosier than the picture in the white
paper," Siew said.</P>
      <P>How best to develop relations across the Taiwan Strait is an
issue of constant and careful concern for our government, Siew
asserted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AMCHAM DRESSING-DOWN (II)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  9  (CNA)
(By Debbie Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Over the past decade, cross-strait relations have seen progress
along the twin tracks of exchange and negotiation, he said.</P>
      <P>"By fostering exchanges, we enhance mutual understanding and
forge common interests. By pursuing negotiations, we resolve
differences and build a stable and friendly relationship."</P>
      <P>Though negotiations have been at a halt since June 1995, he said,
exchanges have continued to broaden and grow. Taiwan's door has been
more widely opened for various categories of visitors from the
mainland. Increasingly more of the mainland's products have been
approved for import to Taiwan, and the offshore transshipment center
plan went into effect earlier this year.</P>
      <P>These measures have deepened and widened the economic engagement
between the people on either side of the Taiwan Strait, Siew said.</P>
      <P>Indeed, it has been the consistent policy of the ROC government
to work toward a united China that enjoys democracy, freedom, and
social justice and equity. "Our ultimate goal is not only
preservation of the security and well-being for our people in Taiwan
but also improvement of the lives of our 1.1 billion brothers and
sisters on the mainland," he added.</P>
      <P>Siew said Taipei has declared many times in the past two years
that the ROC remains ready and willing for cross-strait talks to
resume, with no preconditions, and has urged that those on the
mainland side should again take their places at the negotiating
table.</P>
      <P>"We therefore welcome the positive response made by (Chinese
mainland) President Jiang in September and are hopeful that the
Koo-Wang talks and other established channels of negotiations be
immediately resumed in the interest of early resolution of all
problems related to cross-strait exchanges and other issues of common
concern," he added.</P>
      <P>The Koo-Wang talks refer to a meeting between the heads of Taipei
and Beijing's intermediary bodies in Singapore in April 1993 which
set the framework for regular dialogue between the two sides. Those
talks were unilaterally suspended by Beijing following ROC President
Lee Teng-hui's landmark visit to the United States in June 1995.</P>
      <P>On partnership with the United States, Siew said, "Whatever the
state of our relations with mainland, we cherish our close friendly
ties with the United States. The ties between us are numerous and
firm."</P>
      <P>In the last decade alone, he said, Taiwan's exports to the United
States have increased almost 40 percent, while the island's imports
have surged nearly fourfold.</P>
      <P>Fully one-fifth of Taiwan's total trade has flowed to and from
the United States. At present, the most important items of that
trade, in both directions, are electronic equipment and machinery,
along with their component parts. "It is little surprise that
information products figure so prominently in our two-way trade, as
America and Taiwan are, respectively, the world's largest and third
largest suppliers of information products," he noted.</P>
      <P>Some 40 percent of Taiwan's total trade is transacted with the
United States, the premier said. The US maintains a substantial
surplus in this trade, at about US$5.4 billion annually. That goes a
long way toward offsetting Taiwan's own surplus in merchandise trade,
he noted.</P>
      <P>On the investment front, he said, some US$4.6 billion flowed into
Taiwan from the United States between 1986 and 1996. That represented
26 percent of all Taiwan's inward foreign domestic investment, and
made the US the second largest foreign investor in this economy.</P>
      <P>Those figures speak for themselves. There obviously are strong
attractions for US companies to invest in Taiwan. Indeed, AmCham says
exactly that in the preface to the white paper. "Now my government's
objective is to make those attractions so strong that the case for
investing here is, quite simply, irresistible," the ROC premier said.</P>
      <P>Siew expressed a big thank-you to the AmCham, which recently
celebrated a presence of 46 years in Taipei, for all its efforts over
those years.</P>
      <P>He said the AmCham has done much in support of US-ROC business
relations. "Not only have you provided vital lines of communication
between your businesses and our government, but you have also played
an important role in promoting intergovernmental dialogue," he
concluded.</P>
      <P>On AmCham's latest "door knock" visit to Washington, the AmCham
delivered a very forceful message urging, among other things,
Taiwan's admission to the World Trade Organization and visits to
Taiwan by senior US officials.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) of
the Republic of China on Thursday called mainland China's protest over
Vice President Lien Chan's visit to Iceland "barbaric and
unreasonable."</P>
      <P>MOFA Spokesman Roy Wu said the protest is baffling and
unnecessary, adding that the move fully exposes the systematic nature
of efforts by Beijing to block Taiwan's participation in
the international community.</P>
      <P>Wu noted that Iceland's Prime Minister David Oddsson and Foreign
Minister Halldor Asgrimsson have both emphasized that Iceland is a
sovereign nation and has the right to issue visas to foreign visitors
and to meet them without interference from other countries.</P>
      <P>The MOFA spokesman said that Lien's visit was supported by his
countrymen and that the government of Iceland has also extended a
friendly welcome to him. As the ROC vice president is traveling in an
unofficial capacity, Wu said the content of his meeting with Oddsson
will only be revealed later at an appropriate time.</P>
      <P>Wu stressed that the ROC is a sovereign country, and its

    <HEADLINE>CANADIAN DISCOVERY TO IMPACT TREATMENT OF EPILEPSY, STROKES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Oct.  8 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Canadian scientists have made an important
discovery that may impact the treatment of debilitating diseases such
as epilepsy and strokes.</P>
      <P>The discovery, details of which were published in the current
issue of Nature magazine, was made by scientists at the National
Research Council's Institute for Biological Science (IBS).</P>
      <P>Their research involves glutamate, one of the brain's major
neurotransmitters that is largely responsible for a number of
cognitive processes such as learning and memory.</P>
      <P>In disorders such as strokes and epilepsy, an excessive secretion
of glutamate results in an over-stimulation of glutamate receptors.
This is believed to initiate a cascade of cellular events culminating
in the death of nerve cells.</P>
      <P>IBS researchers have focused on a glutamate receptor subtype
called AMPA. The AMPA receptor is an ion channel that is closely
associated with neuro-transmission and cognitive processes in the
brain.</P>
      <P>Ion channels are pores in the outer membranes of neurons that
control the flow of ions in and out of these cells. Their activation
is critical to the generation of nerve impulses. Over-stimulation of
AMPA receptors have also been linked to neuronal damage and death
associated with strokes.</P>
      <P>It has long been assumed that the only function of the AMPA
receptor is its ion channel activity. However, IBS researchers have
identified a new role for the AMPA receptor; it can bind and activate
a crucial intracellular signaling protein called a G-protein.</P>
      <P>G-proteins, when activated, are known to be one of the cells'
most important intracellular messengers, triggering a variety of
responses, ultimately dictating changes in gene expression and
cellular behavior.</P>
      <P>It is well known that the activity of various ion channels can be
affected by G-proteins, but scientists at IBS are the first to
provide evidence that an ion channel can activate and modulate a
G-protein.</P>
      <P>The principal researchers Dr. Yizheng Wang and Dr. Jon Durkin are
hopeful that this exciting discovery will have far-reaching research
and clinical implications.</P>
      <P>"One important point that arises from this study is that since we
show for the first time that mutually independent signals are
generated by AMPA receptor stimulation, drugs will eventually be
developed that can selectively modulate one pathway without affecting
the other," said Durkin, the project leader.</P>
      <P>"This will result in therapeutic treatments that are more
specific, with less side effects, than drugs currently under
development," he added.</P>

    <DATELINE>New  York,  Oct.  8  (CNA)
(By Ranan Huang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A United Nations agency was forced to
abandon joint sponsorship of a high-level meeting, with the World
Trade Organization, after Beijing objected that the venue would
provide Taiwan with a de facto political platform.</P>
      <P>According to a Journal of Commerce dispatch from Geneva on
Tuesday, the WTO will now be the sole host of the conference to
promote market-access opportunities for the world's poorest nations.</P>
      <P>"The Chinese forced this," commented a senior US official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.</P>
      <P>About 35 trade ministers representing some of the world's poorest
countries, those with annual per capita incomes of US$500 or less,
are expected to attend the meeting, scheduled for Oct. 27-28.</P>
      <P>Following months of behind-the-scenes diplomacy in Geneva,
Beijing and Washington decided in a special session of the WTO
General Council on Tuesday that the meeting would be hosted by the
trade watchdog body alone, in order to effectively prevent Taiwan
from attending the meeting.</P>
      <P>The dispatch noted that at the WTO summit in Singapore last
December, trade ministers had agreed that the WTO, along with the UN
Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and other agencies,
should organize a meeting to discuss ways to enhance trade
opportunities for the world's poorest countries.</P>
      <P>However, China remained adamant to the end that participation by
UNCTAD would be seen as de facto participation by Taiwan in a UN
meeting, said senior diplomats familiar with the matter.</P>
      <P>With Taiwan being an observer at the WTO and China holding a seat
on the United Nations Security Council, Beijing felt the joint
sponsorship would be seen as mainland China and Taiwan participating
under equal status at the same international conference.</P>
      <P>The Journal of Commerce cited diplomats in charge of trade issues
as saying that the insistence by a group of Central American
countries -- including El Salvador and Costa Rica -- that Taiwan and
other WTO observer nations not be excluded from the meeting left the
UN agency with no alternative but to step aside.</P>
      <P>But a number of WTO representatives noted that the political
hiccup instigated by Beijing is unlikely to affect the substance of
the meeting, which could climax with the United States, the European
Union, Japan, and other powers making new market-opening commitments
for the world's poorest countries, the journal said.</P>

them preferring baby girls, according to a survey released on
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The study of orphanages throughout Turkey found that more than 90
percent of the families would prefer an abandoned child aged up to
three years. They want to adopt children at the earliest age
possible, which they feel is the best situation for their own future
as well as that of the infants, the survey said.</P>
      <P>The survey also said that 70 percent of the families prefer to
adopt girls because they can be helpful for housework and can take
care of the adoptive parents during their old age. Another 20 percent
prefer boys and 10 percent didn't indicate any preference.</P>
      <P>Turkish law does not permit the separation of siblings in the

    <HEADLINE>ROC VICE PRESIDENT MEETS ICELANDIC PRIME MINISTER (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Reykjavik,  Oct.  8  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite a strong protest from Beijing,
Icelandic Prime Minister David Oddsson hosted a dinner at his summer
residence as scheduled on Wednesday, in honor of visiting ROC Vice
President Lien Chan.</P>
      <P>Oddsson told the press that Iceland's policy has always been and
will continue to be to recognize the Beijing government, but this
doesn't mean that Iceland cannot host private visits by senior
officials from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"We cannot accept that other nations tell us when and how various
private individuals visit our country," the Icelandic prime minister
said, adding that it "won't be a problem" even if President Lee
Teng-hui wants to make a sight-seeing trip to the North Atlantic
island nation.</P>
      <P>Describing the dinner party as pleasant and amicable, Lien
recalled that he had discussed with Oddsson some practical measures
for promoting tourism and academic and cultural exchanges between the
Republic of China and Iceland. "We also explored the feasibility of
exchanging professors and students and cooperating in oceanographic
research," he said, adding that they had already reached consensus on
these issues.</P>
      <P>The vice president further said he sees no major difficulties for
the two countries to exchange representative offices, but he added
that the two sides have yet to work out a concrete plan in this
respect.</P>
      <P>Lien went on to say he admires Oddsson's spirit in ignoring the
pressure from Beijing to invite him to visit Iceland, adding that
Oddsson has accepted an invitation to visit Taiwan at an appropriate
time.</P>
      <P>Lien again urged Beijing to understand that Taiwan's pragmatic
diplomacy is a necessity to maintain its survival in the
international community, not a strategy to challenge or provoke
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Noting that the ROC is already the world's 14th-largest trading
nation, Lien said it is incomprehensible that its leaders cannot
"walk out into the world" with dignity.</P>
      <P>The vice president said Taiwan must engage with other countries
to upgrade its technology and sustain its economic development. "For
instance, I have come to Iceland to talk about trade and investment,
not to deal with any political issues," he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Lien said Iceland attaches great importance to its trade with
Asia, especially with Taiwan, which is Iceland's second-largest
market in Asia, behind only Japan.</P>
      <P>"After my few days' stay here, I find Taiwan has much it can
learn from Iceland and that there is ample room for our two countries
to cooperate," the vice president noted.</P>
      <P>Noting that Iceland has the world's oldest system of
parliamentary politics, dating back to 930 A.D., Lien said Taiwan can
learn from Iceland's experience in pursuing social equality,
fairness, justice, harmony and welfare services.</P>
      <P>Lien said Oddsson has promised to improve visa services for
prospective Taiwan visitors. ROC nationals currently make an average
of six million overseas visits a year, only 5,000 of which are to
Iceland. "Taiwan and Icelandic travel agencies should work
hand-in-hand to lure more Taiwan visitors to this beautiful country,"
he said.</P>
      <P>The deep-sea fishing industry is also a field suitable for
ROC-Iceland cooperation, Lien said. Taiwan's fishing industry has
developed rapidly over the last few decades, with annual production
growing from NT$500 million (US$17.48 million) in 1963 to more than
NT$84 billion (US$2.94 billion) in 1996.</P>
      <P>Situated in some of the richest fishing grounds in the world,
Iceland possesses advanced deep-sea fishing technology and
seafood-processing expertise, Lien said, adding that fishing industry
executives from both countries should meet to explore possible
cooperative projects.</P>
      <P>Lien suggested that Taiwan entrepreneurs should study the
feasibility of investing in the high-energy-consuming metal refining
industry in Iceland, as the volcanic island has abundant cheap
geothermal-generated electricity. (By Nelson Chung and Sofia Wu)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia's Defense Minister Ian McLachlan
has attacked the US Congress for criticizing Indonesia's human rights
record, saying Washington is losing an opportunity to exert
greater influence in the region.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the eve of the annual Ausmin talks -- the foreign
affairs and defense ministers' forum in Washington that is the
successor to the ANZUS talks -- McLachlan urged the United States to
increase its level of policy interest in Asia if it wants to enhance
its future commercial and strategic leverage.</P>
      <P>In a dispatch from Washington, mass-circulation newspaper The
Australian on Thursday quoted McLachlan as saying that the end of the
Cold War competition has clearly brought profound changes to the
Asian Pacific area.</P>
      <P>"It is a region characterized by growth, energy, great diversity
and, unlike postwar Europe, there is an absence of established ways
to handle security differences peacefully," he said.</P>
      <P>"In Southeast Asia, economic growth has created a number of
vigorous states. Indonesia, in particular, will emerge over the
coming decades as a significant power," McLachlan noted.</P>
      <P>He said the US Clinton administration has taken a measured
approach on Indonesian matters, but added that Washington's voice is
not being heard as clearly as it could be.</P>
      <P>"The voice that is heard is the voice of those people in Congress
complaining about human rights," he said.</P>
      <P>McLachlan's comments followed reports that Prime Minister John
Howard and Australian officials are trying to mediate a rift between
the US and Indonesia over Washington's attacks on Jakarta's human
rights record.</P>
      <P>Indonesian President Suharto has canceled a purchase order of
US-made F-16 jet fighters, opting instead to procure combat aircraft

      <P>The Ministry of Finance (MOF) welcomed the proposal, saying it
has the ministry's full support since the plan is aimed at improving
people's health further.</P>
      <P>MOF officials, however, said several related issues will have to
be tackled before the proposal can become law.</P>
      <P>They said it would not be necessary to revise the Health
Insurance Law. An article can be added to the existing Anti-Smoking
Law to create a legal basis for the health tax.</P>
      <P>They said they also expect controversy to arise over whether the
central government or local governments would be responsible for
collecting the tax.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EIGHT CRIMES IN PAST 12 MONTHS LEAVE 4 POLICE DEAD, 12 INJURED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 9 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>There have been eight crimes in the past 12
months that have resulted in the death or injury of police officers
in Taiwan, revealing that some criminals here are now more heavily
armed than the police.</P>
      <P>During the latest gun battle Thursday morning, a suspect shot at
police with an Uzi and a .90-caliber handgun, killing one policeman
and injuring two others, but the suspect, who was wearing a
high-quality bulletproof vest, received no life-threatening injuries.</P>
      <P>Four police officers have lost their lives since October 1996,
while one was made brain-dead and 11 others were wounded, according
to statistics by the National Police Administration.</P>
      <P>A lawmaker said in a plenary meeting at the Legislative Yuan on
Thursday that there are around 50,000 smuggled guns on the island,
saying they are partly responsible for Taiwan's deteriorating social
order.</P>
      <P>Cheng Pao-ching of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party
questioned the efficiency of the police, citing official figures that
only around 2,000 illegal firearms are seized every year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TSMC CLOSES HIGHER ON 1ST TRADING DAY ON NYSE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  Oct.  8 (CNA)
(By Jennifer Huang &amp; Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's "white sun in a
blue sky on a crimson background" national flag was hoisted inside
and outside the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on Wednesday to mark
the first day of trading of the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Corp. (TSMC) shares on the world's largest and oldest stock market.</P>
      <P>TSMC stock opened at US$24.8125, which was calculated in terms of
its closing price on the Taiwan Stock Exchange on Tuesday. As the
company has long enjoyed a good reputation in the world semiconductor
foundry service sector, share prices increased steadily from opening
amid active buying. The price reached a high of US$26.1875 at one
point, closing at US$26.125, a US$1.3125 or 5.29 percent rise.</P>
      <P>More than 2.57 million TSMC shares changed hands, with turnover
reaching US$67.38 million. TSMC was one of the few stocks which
managed to post gains on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>TSMC Chairman Chang Chung-mo made a special trip to New York to
witness the listing of his company's stock on the NYSE. TSMC is the
first Taiwan company permitted to trade its stock on the 205-year-old
exchange.</P>
      <P>At a reception hosted by the NYSE management to celebrate the
TSMC listing, Chang said his company consistently posted 100 percent
growth in its annual after-tax profits between 1991 and 1996. The
world's largest semiconductor foundry service firm netted NT$20
billion in profits on a turnover of NT$40 billion last year, and its
net profits are estimated at NT$14.2 billion this year, he noted.</P>
      <P>The TSMC took the lead in launching the chip foundry service in
1987 and dominated the market for seven years, Chang said, adding
proudly that although some Taiwan, Singaporean and Malaysian
companies followed in the footsteps of TSMC to offer similar
services, many of them have come to understand that they stand only a
slim chance of overtaking his company's lead in the field.</P>
      <P>Chang went on to say that keen competition forced down wafer
prices early this year, but that prices have gradually stabilized
since April, "so our company's profitability won't be affected."</P>
      <P>The 120 million TSMC shares to be traded on the NYSE in the form
of American Deposit Receipts (ADR) were released by Dutch electronics
giant Philips, one of TSMC's major shareholders. Philips originally
planned to offer only 75 million shares for trading on the NYSE, but
later increased the quantity due to hot market demand.</P>

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia, one of the world's major
producers and exporters of liquefied natural gas (LNG), is trying to
sell LNG to mainland China, the mass circulation newspaper The
Australian reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>In a dispatch from Beijing, the daily reported West Australian
Premier Richard Court and Northern Territory Chief Minister Shane
Stone met mainland Chinese Vice Premier Zhu Rongji to discuss the
supply of LNG from gas fields off the northwest coast of Australia
and in the Timor Sea.</P>
      <P>The two secured an agreement with the mainland Chinese State
Planning Commission to conduct a review by the end of this year on
the viability of supplying mainland coastal provinces with LNG for
power generation.</P>
      <P>Currently, Japan is the only long-term buyer of Australian LNG.</P>
      <P>Australia's LNG production is now about 7.5 million tonnes a year
but could expand to up to 30 million tonnes a year by 2010, experts
said.</P>
      <P>As a result, Australian LNG producers have to look for markets in
mainland China and elsewhere in Asia, including Taiwan, Thailand,
India and the Philippines.</P>
      <P>Taiwan already has 20-year contracts with two other major
producers: Indonesia and Malaysia.</P>
      <P>Court said LNG has to compete with the traditional source of
power generation in Asia: coal.</P>
      <P>"Compared with coal, which now accounts for 70 percent of all
energy production in China, LNG is viewed to have strong
environmental advantages," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>S'PORE'S ELECTRONICS SECTOR TURNS IN SLUGGISH GROWTH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore, Oct. 9 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore's electronics production growth
slowed to 3.7 percent in August -- down from 9 percent in the
previous month -- a sign that all is still not well here with this
vital sector.</P>
      <P>Overall, output of electronics products in the first eight months
of this year was marginally lower than the total for the same period
last year.</P>
      <P>Electronics production accounts for 46 percent of Singapore's
total manufacturing output and is thus critical to the health of this
sector. Manufacturing in turn generates almost a quarter of
Singapore's gross domestic product (GDP).</P>
      <P>An indication that the expected electronics recovery has yet to
materialize fully came from the August trade figures released last
month.</P>
      <P>The key export of non-oil domestic products grew by 5.5 percent
year-on-year, or about half of the double-digit growth forecast by
analysts and economists.</P>
      <P>Releasing the monthly industrial production index for August
Wednesday, the Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB) said the
output of disk drives saw healthy growth, though the growth rate was
lower than before.</P>
      <P>Higher output of telecommunications products and semiconductors
was negated by declining production of personal computers and
consumer electronics, it said.</P>
      <P>The cumulative output of electronics for the first eight months
of this year registered a marginal decline of 0.5 percent compared to
the same months of last year.</P>
      <P>Manufacturing output rose 6.5 percent in August compared to a
year ago. While production by the chemical industry expanded, overall
growth was pulled down by the electronics industry.</P>
      <P>The EDB said cumulative output from January to August this year
was a mere 1 percent higher compared to the same period of last year.</P>
      <P>The star performer for August was the chemical industry, which
saw a 30 percent increase in output. Its cumulative output for the
first eight months of this year grew by an impressive 15.5 percent,
with the major contribution coming from petrochemicals, the EDB said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW CPC CHAIRMAN VOWS TO BOOST MARALE OF EMPLOYEES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 9 (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The new head of state-run Chinese Petroleum
Corp. (CPC) on Thursday pledged to strengthen safety measures to
eliminate accidents and boost the morale of all CPC employees.</P>
      <P>CPC chairman Chen Chao-wei said in his inauguration ceremony that
sound industrial safety measures must be carefully implemented and
that all CPC employees will be required to faithfully observe the
measures.</P>
      <P>The CPC has been plagued with a string of accidents in recent
years. A huge gas explosion on Sept. 13 in the southern Taiwan city
of Kaohsiung claimed the lives of 11 people, prompting the
resignation on Sept. 17 of former CPC chairman S.J. Lee.</P>
      <P>The most recent CPC accident was an explosion on a CPC oil tanker
on Tuesday near the Kaohsiung harbor, which killed two maintenance
workers.</P>
      <P>Chen said CPC employee morale is low because workers are worried
about the possibility of pay cuts when the company is privatized in
2000. A new system of reward and punishment will be strictly applied
as part of efforts to boost morale and he said he is also willing to
have more contact with his staff and to hear their points of view.</P>
      <P>Chen, who served as chairman of Taipei's Mass Rapid Transit
System before taking over his new position, said he believes that if
all CPC employees work as a team, the accident rate will be greatly
reduced, but he admitted that his improvements will take some time.</P>

    <HEADLINE>M'LAND CHINA, TAIWAN BUYING AUSTRALIAN IRON, COPPER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct.  9  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China will import increasing
amounts of Australian iron and copper ore because of its growing
demand for the products to fuel its economic growth, energy analysts
predicted.</P>
      <P>Mainland China imported about 23 million tonnes of iron ore and
191,000 tonnes of copper ore from Australia in fiscal 1996-97,
according to official statistics here.</P>
      <P>Taiwan did not import copper ore from Australia. But it imported
23,000 tonnes of refined copper from Australia in 1996-97. Taiwanese
importers bought copper ore on the spot market, according to the
Australian Department of Energy and Resources (DER).</P>
      <P>Currently, mainland China's total imports of iron ore range from
40 million to 45 million tonnes a year and Australian officials
predicted the figure could double by 2001.</P>
      <P>Australia exported about 5.5 million tonnes of iron ore to Taiwan
in 1996-97 and DER officials said they expect there will be steady
increases in Australian iron ore exports to Taiwan because of new
steel mills coming on line in a couple of years.</P>
      <P>The officials said mainland China is expected to buy more iron
and copper ore from major producers such as Australia to fuel its
fast-growing economy in the next few years.</P>
      <P>Mainland China is now Australia's third-largest iron ore market
and second largest copper market.</P>
      <P>Australia produced 152 million tonnes of iron ore in 1996-97 and
560,000 tonnes of copper ore. It also turned out 325,000 tonnes of
refined copper in that period.</P>
      <P>The mainland Chinese Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources
predicts mainland China will import about one million tonnes of iron
ore and almost one million tonnes of copper ore per year by 2000.</P>
      <P>Energy analysts said they believe Taiwan and mainland China could
likely compete with each other in the import of iron ore and copper
ore from Australia in coming years.</P>
      <P>"But China would have upper hand because of its greater demand
for iron ore and copper ore than Taiwan," one analyst said.</P>
      <P>Australia, however, is expected to supply iron ore and copper ore
to both sides of the Taiwan Strait because both countries are major
importers.</P>
      <P>"Australia is expected to try to satisfy both sides of the Taiwan
Strait in the future," another analyst said. "Taiwan has been a
reliable buyer of Australian iron ore and copper ore and Australian
producers have high regards for Taiwanese buyers."</P>
      <P>Australia now competes with South America, including Brazil, in
the supply of iron ore and copper ore in the world market.</P>
      <P>But the DER officials said Australia has the advantage of its
proximity to Asia.</P>
      <P>"As a producer of energy resources, we are more than happy to
supply our iron ore and copper ore to any countries, including Taiwan
and China, in the future," one senior official, who declined to be
named, said in an interview with CNA on Thursday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FULL TEXT OF PRESIDENT LEE TENG-HUI'S NATIONAL DAY MESSAGE  (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 9 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The following is the full text of President
Lee Teng-hui's National Day message issued on the eve of the Republic
of China's 86th National Day, which falls on Oct. 10:</P>
      <P>Ladies and Gentlemen:</P>
      <P>Today is the 86th National Day of the Republic of China. We are
gathered here not only to celebrate the awesome success of the
founding of the Republic of China, but more importantly, to reflect
upon the revolutionary ideals of our nation's founding fathers, to
carry forward their nation-building spirit and to create much greater
and brighter prospects for the development of our country.</P>
      <P>Nearly a century ago, Dr. Sun Yat-sen drew up blueprints for the
development of a democratic, free and equitably prosperous Republic
of China. Although the tides of time have been rough, and our nation
has encountered many obstacles throughout its 86 years of history,
the Republic of China at long last stands tall and firm. At the heart
of ROC's resilience are an unshakable belief in democracy and a
responsible attitude toward history. Today, we can proudly say that
in the areas currently under the jurisdiction of the Republic of
China--Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu--the ideals of Dr. Sun
Yat-sen have already been realized. With our spectacular success in
building a full-fledged democracy, an open society, a prosperous
economy, and good living conditions, we have written a new page in
the history of the Chinese people.</P>
      <P>The significance of history lies in its ability to pass the torch
of wisdom from one generation to the next. The value of history, on
the other hand, derives from its power to use its heritage to propel
the human spirit forward into the future. Our achievements of today
are possible only because of the firm foundation laid down by the
countless brave and honorable martyrs who struggled and sacrificed
before us. And now, having pushed our nation to new heights of
development, we must continue our efforts. We must remain firm in
upholding the ideals of democracy and freedom so that we can create a
safer, more stable, and more dignified environment for the next
generation, enable the ROC to overcome challenges and open new
horizons in the face of fierce competition in the 21st century.</P>
      <P>For these reasons, we must coalesce the energy of our people
toward promoting a national re-engineering that continues to
spur national development:</P>
      <P>We must make constitutional reform the foundation for the
realization of democratic ideals and must actively promote
educational reform, judicial reform, administrative reform and
cultural development, and establish a fair, just, modern, humanistic
and compassionate society. At the same time, laws must be strictly
enforced, crime must be effectively combated, and law and order must
be strengthened to ensure the safety of the people and restore peace
to society.</P>
      <P>We will spare no effort in our drive to transform Taiwan into an
Asia-Pacific Regional Operations Center. Capitalizing on our many
existing advantages, we will make Taiwan a "technology island." At
the same time, through the revision of laws and regulations, we will
create a more liberal and global environment for economic
development, eliminate barriers to investment, eradicate bottlenecks
in development, accelerate upgrading of industry, and raise our
international competitiveness. Meanwhile, we must emphasize
environmental protection and ecological conservation to reach our
objective of sustained development through moderate growth and
rigorous conservation.</P>
      <P>Guided by the principles of unyielding defense and effective
deterrence, we must aggressively implement our troop reduction
program and complete the acquisition of second-generation weaponry
systems in order to build a modern national defense and better ensure
our national security. Furthermore, we believe in ensuring regional
security and prosperity as well as building a peaceful world, and we
are willing to work together with other Asia-Pacific countries to
promote regional security and stability.</P>
      <P>We will continue to pursue pragmatic diplomacy and contribute to
the global village. We will strive to participate in the
international community, strengthen cordial and cooperative bonds
with friendly nations and enhance substantive relations with those
nations with which we do not maintain diplomatic ties. In addition,
we will actively take part in international organizations and
activities, so that nations around the world must acknowledge the
reality of the ROC's existence and development. This will enhance our
international status, uphold our dignity in the world and safeguard.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 9 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>It is our position that cross-strait relations can only be
pursued on the conditions that the existence and development of the
ROC are maintained and the security and welfare of the 21.6 million
people in the Taiwan area are safeguarded. We have stated time and
again our most sincere desire to pursue unification under democracy,
freedom, and equitable distribution of wealth. Regardless of the fact
that the mainland authorities have yet to respond with goodwill, we
have repeatedly called for the two sides to end the state of
hostility across the Taiwan Strait, resume negotiations, and engage
in peaceful competition. We sincerely hope that Peking will adopt a
pragmatic attitude and open mind and face up to the reality that
Taiwan and mainland are ruled separately. We also hope that the
mainland leadership will take positive actions to increase mutual
trust, narrow the gap between the two sides, and allow for an
historic new "win-win" era of cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Ladies and gentlemen: During the past half century, we have
worked together hand in hand with singular objective and created a
world-renowned miracle in the areas of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and
Matsu. We have also gradually established, for the Republic of China,
an important position impossible to ignore in the international
community. Looking to the future, we are fully confident of building
on our present well-established foundation to achieve even greater
development. It is our belief that as long as our people remained
committed to the ideal of democracy, enthusiastically carry forward
reforms, and actively pursue progress, we will surely be able to
seize every opportunity to create advantages and open doors to ever
more brilliant prospects for our nation in the 21st century.</P>
      <P>In closing, I wish the Republic of China everlasting prosperity
and to each and every one of you, good health and happiness. Thank
you! (end)</P>

    <HEADLINE>US  POURS  COLD  WATER ON BEIJING'S WTO ENTRY BID</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  Oct.  9 (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US Commerce Secretary William Daley poured
cold water on hopes that remaining hurdles to Beijing's accession to
the Geneva-based World Trade Organization (WTO) could be cleared when
mainland China's President Jiang Zemin visits Washington at the end
of the month, according to reports from the world trade regulatory
body on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Daley said that a decision on mainland China's entry into the WTO
should not be tied to a certain date or event. "It's much more
important to be on the right way rather than trying to be rushing,"
he was quoted by the WTO report as saying.</P>
      <P>Daley said Washington is not satisfied with results yielded in
ongoing talks with mainland China led by US Trade Representative
Charlene Barshefsky, and is not optimistic.</P>
      <P>"We have not seen the progress that we would have liked to see.
It's difficult right now... because of the offers on the table so
far," he was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>With both sides proclaiming that the upcoming summit between US
President Bill Clinton and Jiang should produce "tangible results,"
anticipation has been mounting in recent months that it could bring a
breakthrough on the WTO issue.</P>
      <P>Noting that the issue will be discussed in and around the summit,
Daley said Washington is waiting for a proposal from mainland China
to be tabled "that accomplishes not only what the United States is
looking for, but many other countries too," according to the WTO
report.</P>

      <P>The sun shone in Singapore for the second
day Thursday.</P>
      <P>For the first time in more than a month, people woke up Wednesday
morning to blue skies and crisp, clean air.</P>
      <P>The air pollution index was in the good-to-moderate range the
whole day, with rain in the afternoon.</P>
      <P>But the weatherman said the improved haze situation will stay for
only a couple of days. After that, periods of hazy weather can be
expected when prevailing southwest winds bring the haze from the
Indonesian island of Sumatra back to Singapore.</P>
      <P>The haze will not go for good until next month, when the
northeast monsoon sets in.</P>
      <P>The weatherman said, however, that the overall situation from now
on will continue to improve gradually as more rain is expected. It
will have a dampening effect on the forest fires in Sumatra and
Kalimantan, he added.</P>
      <P>The 24-hour PSI (Pollutants Standard Index) reading of 55
Wednesday was a pre-haze level, and at one point, the three-hour

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew on Thursday said that
it is unfair and unjust to exclude the Republic of China from the
international community due to pressure from mainland China.</P>
      <P>Siew told over 100 foreign reporters in Taiwan to cover the ROC
National Day "Double Tenth" celebrations, that as the world is
destined to move away from bloody confrontation toward peaceful and
rational dialogue, it is the hope of the ROC to move forward hand in
hand with the international community.</P>
      <P>Siew said that whether the theater of operations is the
Asia-Pacific region, Europe, America, Africa, or even the Chinese
mainland, the ROC will do its best to strengthen regional economic
cooperation, mutual help and international friendship. This is why
President Lee Teng-hui participated in the World Congress on the
Panama Canal and the Central American summit meeting in September and
why he declared his willingness to embark on a "journey of peace" to
the Chinese mainland, he added.</P>
      <P>Addressing cross-strait relations, Siew stressed that while
pursuing the unification of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, the

      <P>Premier Vincent Siew held out an olive
branch to mainland China on Thursday, urging it to act positively
towards Taiwan's call for an end to hostility across the Taiwan
Strait and ring in a new era of "Chinese help Chinese" by joining
with Taiwan in efforts to push ahead with cross-strait exchanges and
dialogue.</P>
      <P>At a rally organized by the government for overseas Chinese
visiting Taiwan to celebrate the Republic of China's 86th National
Day on Oct. 10, the premier expressed thanks to overseas Chinese for
the warm reception they extended to President Lee Teng-hui during his
Latin American trip early last month and the firm support they have
rendered to the government by returning to their homeland to mark the
country's birthday.</P>
      <P>He ticked off the country's most notable achievements --
including the possession of the world's third-largest foreign
reserves, becoming the world's seventh-biggest source of investment
outflow and becoming the world's 15th-biggest trading nation, not to
mention its much-publicized democratization -- putting them down to
the tireless efforts of countrymen at home and the care and support
of overseas Chinese around the globe.</P>
      <P>Noting the historical events that have separated the ROC on
Taiwan from mainland China for more than 50 years, the first native
Taiwanese premier called on the Beijing to match Taipei's friendly
gestures of renouncing force to reclaim the mainland and lifting a
travel ban on people from Taiwan wishing to visit the mainland.</P>
      <P>Thursday's rally, held at the Linkou Stadium in suburban Taipei,
brought together more than 7,000 overseas Chinese from all over the
world to watch a display of folk dance, martial arts, Chinese opera
and performances by renowned local singers and entertainers.</P>

      <P>A session of the Legislative Yuan on
Thursday ratified an agreement signed by 39 countries including
Taiwan, regarding the Republic of China's implementation of a World
Trade Organization (WTO) declaration on information technology (IT)
products.</P>
      <P>According to the terms of the agreement, the ROC should gradually
cut tariffs on 274 IT items to zero in four stages by 2000, beginning
from July 1, 1997.</P>
      <P>The WTO convened a decisive trade ministers' meeting to discuss
the tariff-cutting program on IT products on March 26 this year,
with an agreement being reached by the 39 attendees. The document was
ratified by the WTO on April 14.</P>
      <P>According to the agreement, the WTO member-countries which
attended the meeting must revise their tariff concession lists
according to Article 28 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT), the forerunner of the WTO. The participating countries will
then be bound by international law according to Article 2 of the
GATT.</P>
      <P>Although the ROC has still not been admitted to the WTO, it

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's "Such a Life," directed by Chen
Cheng-chih, on Thursday won the best picture award at the
Asia-Pacific Film Festival, being held on Cheju Island, South Korea.</P>
      <P>"I feel wonderful!" Chen said when he learned that his second
film, which premiered at the festival, had won two awards -- best
picture and a special "peace" award, in the Asia-Pacific region's
most important film festival.</P>
      <P>"Such a Life", based on a true story of 1950's Taiwan, depicts
the unhappy life of a small boy living in a poor village in southern
Taiwan, where many of the villagers were suffering from "black foot
disease."</P>
      <P>"Ah Chung" endured constant bullying by his classmates, but he
didn't care, devoting all his time to providing for his grandfather,
who had lost both feet to the disease. Ah Chung managed to eke a
living selling popsicles on the street and sometimes stealing a few
clams until he was caught and drowned while trying to escape.</P>
      <P>The young protagonist "Ah Chung" was played by primary school
student Lin Yi-chih, playing in his debut role. The film also
featured Taiwanese puppet master Lee Tien-lu and Taiwanese opera
actress Tung Mei-yun.</P>
      <P>Another film from Taiwan -- "A Cha-Cha the Fugitive" won three
awards -- best cinematography, best editing and best sound. The movie
was directed by Wang Tsai-hsiang, famous for a series of
controversial TV commercials for "Stimorol" brand chewing gum.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's "Excessive for Beauty," a cartoon by five university
students, won the award for best animated film.</P>
      <P>Cheung Man Yuk took best leading actress for Hong Kong's
"Comrades, Almost a Love Story," which was also won best screenplay,
while Koji Yakusho won best leading actor for Japan's "The Eel,"
which also took the award for best director.</P>
      <P>Eriko Watanabe won best supporting actress for Japan's "Shall We
Dance," while Kim Il-woo won best supporting actor for South Korea's

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  10  (CNA)
(By Debbie Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An Air Force C-130 transport aircraft
crashed at Taipei's Sungshan Airport on Friday morning as it
attempted to land at a nearby military base, killing all five crew
members onboard and injuring two other persons on the ground.</P>
      <P>In a press conference held at 11:00 a.m., the Air Force General
Headquarters reported that the military plane first tried to land at
the Sungshan military base around 8:10 a.m. but had to abort the
effort because of poor visibility.</P>
      <P>The plane then circled around for a second landing attempt, when
it suddenly nose-dived and crashed near the runway of the adjacent
civilian airport. Killed in the mishap were the pilot and co-pilot,
both Air Force majors, and three sergeants aboard the aircraft, who
were on a routine transport mission from Pingtung to Taipei,
according to Air Force spokesman Lee Tien-yu.</P>
      <P>Lee said a preliminary investigation showed that low cloud cover
near the airport was most likely the major factor behind the
accident. Mechanical failure and human error also may have
contributed to the crash. The true cause of the mishap will be known
only after the plane's "black box" flight recorder is analyzed, he
added.</P>
      <P>Two Air Force guards near the military base, who were on duty
when the C-130 nose-dived, were seriously burnt by the flames which
erupted from the plane upon impact. They were rushed to a nearby
hospital for emergency treatment.</P>
      <P>The Air Force sealed off the Sungshan Airport immediately after
the accident occurred and all inbound and outbound passenger flights
from the airport were suspended until 11:30 a.m.</P>
      <P>A drill by Air Force planes, scheduled to be staged Friday
morning as part of the performances to mark the Republic of China's

      <P>Taiwan's up-and-coming microchip industry
is expected to churn out US$66 billion worth of ICs and related
products by 2005, making it the third largest IC producer in the
world, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) reported Friday.</P>
      <P>According to an MOEA survey, investment in Taiwan's IC
manufacturing grew by a whopping 33 percent in 1996, much higher than
the average 5 percent posted by the rest of the world.</P>
      <P>The island's IC industry continued to flourish as the upstream
feeder to computer and related information manufacturers last year.</P>
      <P>In 1996, Taiwan's information technology (IT) industry chalked up

third in the world, behind only the United States and Japan.</P>
      <P>Among the IT products, the output of monitors, motherboards,
computer mice and keyboards also made Taiwan the world's top supplier

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Gyalo Thondup, brother of the Dalai Lama,
the exiled spiritual leader of Tibet, said here Friday that the Dalai
Lama hopes to visit Taiwan again.</P>
      <P>Thondup, who was in Taipei as the head of a delegation of
overseas Tibetans attending the Republic of China's Double Tenth
National Day celebrations, said the Dalai Lama was impressed by
what he saw during his first trip to Taiwan on March 22-27 this
year and hopes to have another opportunity to visit the island.</P>
      <P>Thondup said he witnessed the national day celebration in 1946,
1947 and 1948 while he was studying in Nanking on the Chinese
mainland. Now, 49 years later, he is attending the event for the
fourth time. It is also the first time he has come to Taiwan for the
Double Tenth celebration, so named because it falls on the tenth day
of the tenth month each year.</P>
      <P>Thondup denied his trip is related to a Tibetan religious fund to
be established in the name of the Dalai Lama, and stressed that his
visit was "private" in nature.</P>
      <P>But he said that Tibetans have lived in exile in India for 38
years and need support and assistance for education, employment and
care for the elderly, adding that many nations have generously
extended a helping hand.</P>
      <P>He cited as an example the fact that India and other members of
the international community have helped over 30,000 Tibetans study
languages in India.</P>
      <P>As to whether the Dalai Lama plans to visit Taiwan again, Thondup
said that there are many difficulties involved in arranging for the
exiled spiritual leader to visit Taiwan. However, following his March
visit, "the gate is open, and the chances will be greater in the
future," Thondup said.</P>
      <P>He said that the Dalai Lama was grateful and deeply moved by the
treatment extended to him by the ROC government and by the concern
shown by the public and religious circles. "He felt like he was
coming back home," Thondup added.</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama is keen to visit Taiwan again, and to increase
exchanges between the local society and the Tibetan community in
religious and cultural fields, he said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  9  (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US Senator Frank Murkowski (R-Alaska)
Thursday cautioned President Bill Clinton that improvement of the
United States' relationship with mainland China should not be
achieved at the expense of US relations with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the Senate floor, Murkowski noted that as Washington
prepares for the Oct. 29 summit meeting between Clinton and his
communist Chinese counterpart Jiang Zemin, there have been press
reports speculating on how the US government would respond to
possible demands by Jiang regarding US relations with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Murkowski said that while he welcomes Jiang's visit to the United
States and supports regular high-level dialogue with Beijing, he
believes that "improving relations with the PRC need not, and indeed
should not, come at the expense of our relationship with Taiwan."</P>
      <P>The Republican senator from Alaska requested that the letter he
and 10 other senators sent to Clinton last week be inserted in the
Congressional Record of Oct. 9. In that joint letter, the senators
urged Clinton to oppose any efforts at the summit by Jiang to
diminish American support for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"We urge you to reject any plans for a 'Fourth Communique' on
issues related to Taiwan; not weaken our defensive arms sales
commitment to Taiwan; and not make any commitment to limit future
visits by the elected representatives of the Republic of China," the
letter said.</P>
      <P>The 11 senators, led by Murkowski, pointed out that Taiwan has
achieved "extraordinary progress" in democratization, with free
elections, free press, strong trade unions and improved trading
practices.</P>
      <P>"We believe the American people are united in their support for
freedom and democracy on Taiwan. Time and again, Congress has made
clear our commitment to Taiwan, beginning with the 1979 Taiwan
Relations Act, and through many resolutions and bills since then,"
they wrote in the letter of Sept. 23.</P>
      <P>"We in Congress are prepared to reiterate the commitment of the
American people to freedom and democracy for the people and
government of Taiwan," they said.</P>
      <P>Among the senators who signed the letter were Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.); Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle
(D-S.D.); Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee; and Sen. Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.), chairman of the
Senate Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs.</P>
      <P>In his floor statement Thursday, Murkowski again urged Clinton to
respect the views of the 11 senators that America's support for
Taiwan's democracy and freedom cannot be sacrificed.</P>
      <P>Murkowski also encouraged the Clinton administration to send
high-level officials to Taiwan to further strengthen bilateral
relations and to "work out the occasional disputes that cloud our
relationship."</P>

played golf with Presidential Advisor Hsu Li-teh and ROC

international beauty contests.</P>
      <P>During Lien's stay in Iceland, Icelandic Prime Minister David
Oddsson hosted a dinner at his summer residence in honor of the ROC
vice president and his entourage despite a strong protest from
Beijing.</P>
      <P>Oddsson, who emphasized Iceland's policy of recognizing Beijing
as the sole Chinese government, said he does not see why Iceland
cannot host private visits by senior officials from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>After some five days of wide reports by Icelandic media of Lien's
visit and Beijing's protests, which were considered by locals as
"confrontational and unnecessary," the Icelandic people have gained
considerable knowledge of Taiwan and its officials.</P>
      <P>Even reporters from Taiwan were welcomed warmly by local
residents, indicating that Lien's "icebreaking" visit here has indeed
won publicity for Taiwan and gained friendship from the Icelandic

returning home from Cheju Island, South Korea, Friday after winning
six awards, including best picture, in the Asia-Pacific Film
Festival.</P>
      <P>Under a government incentive program to promote the local film
industry, the producers of the award-winning picture "Such a Life,"
will receive a cash prize of NT$1 million (US$34,965) while its
director Chang Chih-yung will receive NT$300,000 (US$10,490).</P>
      <P>"Such a Life" depicts the tragedy of a poor village in southern
Taiwan during the 1950s where the residents suffered from a condition
known as "black foot disease," caused by drinking contaminated
water.</P>
      <P>Another film from Taiwan, "Ah Cha-cha the Fugitive," won three

"Excessive for Beauty," an animated film created by five university
students, won the award for best animation.</P>
      <P>David Tawei Lee, director general of the Government Information

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA RATED AMONG THE WORLD'S HIGHEST IN SKIN CANCER AND SUICIDE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra, Oct. 10 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia was rated as having the world's
highest rate of melanoma and has one of the most frequent occurrences
of colon cancer, male suicide and female homicide among 20 of the
most developed countries, according to a new survey.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted by the Australian Institute of Health and
Welfare, showed Australia and New Zealand shared the dubious
distinction of having the world's top skin cancer death rates.</P>
      <P>The Sydney Morning Herald today quoted a report by the institute
as saying that: "Malignant melanoma is the cancer that has shown the
most rapid increase in incidence amongst most white populations in
the last several decades."</P>
      <P>For every 100,000 Australian males, 24.2 had melanoma in the
mid-1980s, rising to 30.9 in recent years, surpassing the rate of
occurrence among non-Maori New Zealanders and white Americans, who
had the next highest levels.</P>
      <P>Australia and New Zealand have seen the largest post-World War II
increase in deaths from melanoma, rising by about two percent a year
from 1950 to 1989, the survey shows.</P>
      <P>Australian females were level with Canadian women in having the
third highest homicide rate out of the 20 developed countries at 1.3
per 100,000 population. The other countries surveyed had less than
one female homicide per 100,000 population, but the United States was
far higher with four per 100,000.</P>
      <P>"Homicide is still a cause for alarm in Australia, but because

    <HEADLINE>PART OF QUEBEC REFERENDUM LAW RULED UNCONSTITUTIONAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Oct.  9  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Supreme Court of Canada on Thursday
struck down part of the Quebec referendum law that limits third party
spending.</P>
      <P>The decision could cause problems for Premier Lucien Bouchard of
Quebec, who is facing a federal government challenge on the legality
of the province's unilateral declaration of independence.</P>
      <P>An angry Bouchard said the court was denying 20 years of Quebec
history. Since the referendum law has been in force, Quebec's
separatist governments have held but failed two referendums. Ottawa
is trying to block a third attempt by Bouchard's separatist
government.</P>
      <P>The ruling says Quebec's referendum law imposes restrictions that
are unjustifiable under the section of the Charter of Rights that
guarantees freedom of expression.</P>
      <P>The law said those who want to get involved in the referendum
campaign have to spend money for either the "Yes" side or the "No"
side. There were no provisions for people to mount independent
campaigns.</P>
      <P>The case was brought by Robert Libman, former leader of Quebec's
Equality Party.</P>
      <P>He had wanted to run his own campaign instead of supporting
either the official Yes or No sides.</P>
      <P>Bloc Quebecois MP Michel Bellehumeur said the ruling effectively
destroys the referendum law. "What is left of the law?" he asked.</P>
      <P>Lower courts ruled the law was a justifiable restriction on free
speech because it was meant to prevent those who have the most money
from dominating a campaign and dictating the outcome.</P>

      <P>Dr. Gunther Winkler, president of the
Institute of Chinese Culture here, is looking forward to Republic of
China Vice President Lien Chan's visit to Austria, saying he will be
"pleased to meet an old friend."</P>
      <P>Former president of Vienna University and expert in
constitutional law, Winkler also serves as president of the Institute
of Chinese Culture here. The organization is dedicated to promoting
relations between Austria and the Republic of China on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Winkler said he expects to exchange views with Lien on
constitutional issues and human rights.</P>
      <P>Lien is expected to arrive in Austria this weekend after
concluding his visit to Reykjavik, Iceland. His scheduled 48-hour
stay in Austria will also take him to Tyrol province in the western
region of the country, an area known for its beautiful Alpine
landscapes.</P>
      <P>Winkler said he will accompany Lien throughout the visit, which
he described as a "transit stop."</P>
      <P>However, because there are no official relations between Austria
and Taiwan, and Communist China has warned of "very serious
consequences" for European host-countries that receive Lien, his
planned trip to Austria remains hush-hush even on the eve of his

    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct.  10  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia's employment rate hit a
two-year high and unemployment rate fell slightly in September,
dashing the hope of further interest rate cuts, according to the
Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).</P>
      <P>The ABS figures showed total employment in September rose by
74,700, sending the unemployment rate down to 8.6 percent from 8.7
percent in August.</P>
      <P>The higher-than-expected employment rate dashed prospects for a
sixth official interest rate cut this year and sent the Australian
dollar higher on Thursday, closing at US$0.73, up 1.33 US cents from
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>But the Australian stock market took a beating with its All
Ordinaries Index closing 46.2 points lower at 2722.2 on Thursday due
to comments by US Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who said a
continued run in the US stock market was "unrealistic" and disagreed
that the US economy was in an era of inflation-free growth.</P>
      <P>Australian economists believed the Reserve Bank of Australia,
which cut official interest rates to 5 percent from 7.5 percent from
July 1996 to July 1997, is unlikely to make further cuts by the end
of this year.</P>
      <P>Australia's inflation, measured by the Consumer Price Index, is
now below the government target of 2 percent to 3 percent. It stood
at about 1.6 percent recently.</P>
      <P>Economists and government officials believe Australia's economy
could grow up to 4 percent or 4.5 percent in fiscal 1997-98, up from

    <HEADLINE>ECCT URGES TAIWAN TO REMOVE OBSTACLES TO LIBERALIZATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 10 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The European Council of Commerce and Trade
(ECCT) has suggested in its latest report that Taiwan speed up the
removal of obstacles to liberalization.</P>
      <P>The Taipei-based ECCT on Thursday released the report, which
reviews the government's progress toward making Taiwan an
Asia-Pacific regional operations center (APROC).</P>
      <P>The report said the path to the realization of Taiwan's APROC
goal is beset with a number of obstacles, and recommended that the
government first lift foreign equity ownership limitations in the
transportation industry.</P>
      <P>The ECCT has been making this suggestion to authorities here for
years, saying that it is difficult for foreign carriers and
forwarders to select Taiwan as a regional hub as long as those
limitations exist.</P>
      <P>The council also noted that although immigration and work permit
laws and regulations are being liberalized, they still do not permit
a number of nationalities easy entry. It said that government
efficiency and the transparency of laws and regulations remain
promising fields for improvements.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan's cross-strait policies -- especially the
"three no's" that forbid direct trade, transportation and postal
links between Taiwan and mainland China -- "act as a significant
disincentive for foreign companies to locate their regional
operations in Taiwan," the ECCT said, noting, however, that these
policies are "possibly necessary based on political considerations."</P>
      <P>The ECCT, founded in early 1988, is the major representative body
for European commercial interests in Taiwan. It is aimed at advancing
and promoting European business interests on the island, mainly by
providing a forum for discussion of major issues and concerns.</P>
      <P>In its APROC evaluation report, the council on the other hand
congratulated Taiwan on the fact that its economy is still healthy
and robust in the wake of economic crises in several of its Southeast
Asian neighbors.</P>
      <P>ECCT Chief Executive Officer Theo Stiftl said, "Taiwan has been
able to avoid the recent financial turbulence of other Asian
countries and indeed is on its way towards a reported growth rate
exceeding 6 percent for 1997, which is a good performance by any
country's measures."</P>

    <DATELINE>Berlin,  Oct.  9  (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin &amp; Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The head of Taiwan's largest opposition
party said in Berlin Thursday that even if his party assumes power it
would not declare the independence of Taiwan nation since this would
provoke mainland China and endanger the safety of the island.</P>
      <P>Hsu Hsin-liang, chairman of Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP), said in a symposium titled "Democratization and Taiwan's
Relations with the World", that as Taiwan is a de facto independent
state, the DPP will not make any unnecessary declarations to provoke
Beijing.</P>
      <P>"The DPP takes a realistic stance in Taiwan's relations with
mainland China," Hsu told over 100 German and Taiwan participants in
the symposium sponsored by the Free University of Berlin, saying
that the DPP wishes to see improvements in relations between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that any dialogue and economic engagement with Beijing,
however, must be conducted on the basis of mutual trust. "On the part
of Taiwan, there must be a coordinated strategy between the
government and the private sector," he added.</P>
      <P>On Taiwan's foreign relations, Hsu said that while stable
relations with Beijing should be Taipei's top foreign policy
priority, the island must continue to develop ties with the rest of
the world.</P>
      <P>The United States and Japan are two of Taiwan's most important
allies in the world, Hsu said, adding that even without diplomatic
relations, Taiwan's trade and cultural ties with these two countries
have been flourishing for years.</P>
      <P>Hsu noted that Taiwan has not developed the same close ties with
Europe as it has with the United States and Japan. The Europeans,
however, have demonstrated their principled support for Taiwan in the
resolution for Taiwan's membership in the United Nations, he said.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that the DPP, founded in 1986, has made significant
contributions to Taiwan's democracy. "The DPP has grown and matured
over the past 11 years. We have adjusted ourselves to the changing
nature of politics in Taiwan," he said.</P>
      <P>"DPP members are no longer the martial-law-defying street
activists but responsible politicians," Hsu said, while expressing
confidence that the DPP is well on its way to becoming Taiwan's
ruling party.</P>

hurt Taiwan in any respect.</P>

Clinton in a joint letter to oppose any attempts by Jiang at the

(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The recent currency crises in Southeast
Asia has caused a significant drop in the region's textile export
quotations, posing a serious threat to the fourth quarter operations
of Taiwan's chemical fiber industry.</P>
      <P>The lowering of quotations by Southeast Asian chemical fiber
manufacturers has resulted in a dramatic slide in the selling prices
of Asian polyester yarns, polyester chips and polyester fibers, said
a source from Taiwan's Far Eastern Textile Corp., adding that
domestic chemical fiber and yarn-processing manufacturers will have
to narrow their export quotations gap to equal those of Malaysia,
Indonesia and Thailand or face the prospect of stagnancy in the
textile industry.</P>
      <P>Another industry source said that quotations of Southeast Asian
chemical fiber plants have fallen about 20 percent in less than a
month, encouraging international businessmen to aggressively shift
their orders to Southeast Asia.</P>
      <P>The drop in export prices has also affected the textile market
here. Because export orders have fallen off recently, domestic
textile industry executives have turned to the local market, causing
a drop in domestic product prices.</P>
      <P>In addition, the selling back to the island by overseas Taiwan
businessmen of products manufactured in Southeast Asia at lower
prices has forced domestic producers to further cut prices,
overshadowing the textile sector's fourth quarter operations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POOR FORECAST FOR TAIWAN'S CHIP MAKERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  Oct.  10  (CNA)
(By David Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's high-tech industry was wrong
when it bet last year that global demand for semiconductor chips
would have emerged from a prolonged slump by now, The Wall Street
Journal said on Friday in a report from Taipei.</P>
      <P>As a result, the paper said, some of Taiwan's star electronics
companies are bleeding money. While more-established rivals in Japan
and South Korea have been curbing production, Taiwan's memory-chip
makers face a murky future, it added.</P>
      <P>According to the paper, Texas Instruments-Acer Inc., Taiwan's
biggest maker of DRAM chips, chalked up losses of NT$667 million
(US$23.4 million) in the first half of the year, compared with an
NT$l.1 billion profit for all of 1996. The company, a joint venture
between Acer Inc., Taiwan's biggest computer maker, and Texas
Instruments Inc. of Dallas, recently slashed profit forecasts by 82
percent for the year.</P>
      <P>Another semiconductor maker, Nan Ya Technology, a unit of Nan Ya
Plastics Corp., predicts losses of at least NT$400 million, partly
because of falling chip prices.</P>
      <P>The drawn-out downturn is prompting some to question the
long-term viability of Taiwan's semiconductor industry as it now
stands.</P>
      <P>To the nation's great pride, it pointed out, Taiwan has morphed
from a maker of cheap goods and copycat items into the world's number
four manufacturer of memory chips. "As latecomers to an industry
dominated by giants from Japan, South Korea and the US, Taiwan
companies found their niche by developing first-rate manufacturing
processes to produce chips no longer profitable for others."</P>
      <P>Taiwan's technological lag is most punishing when the chips are
down, as now, the paper said. For a semiconductor factory, costs are
determined chiefly by how many chips it's able to cut from a single
silicon wafer; the more advanced its technology, the more chips it
can produce per wafer and the more efficient the production process.</P>
      <P>The escalating costs and exhausting pace of new technology could
push some Taiwan players out of the business altogether, the report
predicted, warning that in fact, the single-minded push to win market
share could further delay any recovery in chip prices.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 11 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is facing a serious gravel shortage
next year, due to a depletion of gravel supplies from local rivers,
according to a draft report by experts unveiled on Saturday.</P>
      <P>The report, commissioned by the Ministry of Economic Affairs
(MOEA), said local rivers are traditionally the main source of Taiwan
gravel, but that the government has gradually banned gravel mining in
several areas out of consideration of land and water conservation.</P>
      <P>The report listed 25 rivers in Taiwan which could provide nearly
590 million tons of gravel. But with the depletion of gravel in
central and northern Taiwan, there is no more gravel left there for
mining. There are still about 27 million tons of gravel left in
rivers in southern Taiwan, with around 280 million tons in central
and eastern Taiwan respectively, but judging from demand in the local
construction industry, supplies are expected to last only until the
end of the year.</P>
      <P>This means the supply of gravel will decline sharply, with
shortages estimated to be between at least 4,000 and 5,000 tons per
year, starting from 1998, a situation which will be further
exacerbated by the construction of the new high-speed rail system
between Taipei and Kaohsiung next year.</P>
      <P>The shortage has caused the price of gravel to skyrocket, with
sources saying that gravel mined from the Chouzuei River in Central
Taiwan has risen from NT$52 (US$1.8) per ton in 1995 to NT$90 in 1997.
Prices in northern Taiwan are even higher, in some cases surpassing
NT$200 per ton.</P>
      <P>In order to meet local demand, the MOEA has permitted gravel
imports from other nations, in addition to lifting a ban on gravel
imports from mainland China.</P>
      <P>But sources say the cost of importing gravel is high, while
importing from the mainland presents its own problems, since under
the present policy, the government still bans direct cross-strait
shipping. This means that mainland gravel has to be routed through a
third country before it can enter Taiwan through Keelung Harbor in
the north or Kaohsiung Harbor in the south.</P>
      <P>With the handling capacity at these two international ports
reaching saturation, the sources stressed the importance for the
government to focus on opening more local ports and improving related
wharf facilities, adding that the report has suggested that the
government consider allowing imports through Anping and Putai Harbors
in southern Tainan County, and Tamsui Harbor in northern Taipei
County.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POLICEMEN RECEIVE NEW BULLET-PROOF VESTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  11  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The National Police Administration (NPA)
has provided 12,000 new bullet-proof vests to Taiwan's police,
following a rash of recent gun battles between the police and armed
criminals which have resulted in the deaths of several policemen.</P>
      <P>Police were elated to don the new vests, saying that they now
felt much safer. They described the new vests as being more flexible
and more adjustable than the old ones, as well as being lighter, the
weight having been cut to 2.5 kilograms from the original 3.25
kilograms.</P>
      <P>The old-style vests are notorious for their poor elasticity and
clumsiness, making it difficult for the officer to use his radio or
even draw his gun.</P>
      <P>However, since there are currently more than 47,000 policemen on
regular patrol, 35,000 of them will have to continue wearing the old
vests for the time being until more new ones are delivered.</P>
      <P>The NPA said that the old vests were purchased before 1994 and
some of them have already passed their expiry dates. The new vests
arrived only recently after extensive safety testing in the United
States.</P>

      <P>Taichung Airport officially opened
its new terminal Saturday.</P>
      <P>At the opening ceremony, Transportation and Communications
Minister Tsay Jaw-yang said the building will help expand the
transportation capacity of central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Beginning next year, there will be direct flights from the new
terminal to Chiang Kai-shek International Airport in northern Taiwan
to facilitate transportation between the two areas.</P>
      <P>The original terminal was built 25 years ago. The 900
square-meter building has seen increasing traffic, especially since
1989, when the government amended laws to open sky.</P>
      <P>In 1994, the terminal processed some 800,000 passenger
departures. By 1996, that figure had doubled.</P>
      <P>In order to meet the airport's growing needs, the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications budgeted a new terminal for it in
1993, Tsay said, noting that the terminal's total cost was NT$250
million (US$8.7 million).</P>
      <P>Vice Premier John Chang and Tsai Tuei, director general of the
Civil Aeronautics Administration, as well as Taichung City Mayor Lin

    <HEADLINE>MORE  SYSTEMATIC  CHANNEL  URGED  FOR  HK-TAIWAN COMMUNICATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hong   Kong,   Oct.   11   (CNA)
(By Stanley Cheung and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Cheng An-kuo, Taiwan's top
representative in Hong Kong, said on Friday that Taiwan and Hong Kong
should establish a systematic communication channel to lay a more
solid foundation for relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Cheng made the remarks in a speech he delivered at a party
marking the Oct. 10 National Day of the Republic of China in Hong
Kong.</P>
      <P>Cheng said that in the 100 days since the handover of the former
British colony to mainland China, relations between Taiwan and the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) have remained more or
less the same, following the establishment between the two sides of a
more open and official communication channel.</P>
      <P>He stressed however that the present framework of Taiwan-Hong
Kong relations does not fully reflect the current situation, which
includes over two million visits and US$29 billion in trade volume
between the two sides.</P>
      <P>He advocated that Taiwan and Hong Kong build a more normal,
stable and comprehensive relationship in order to lay the foundation
for more solid cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Paul Yip, special adviser to HKSAR Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa,
said on the same occasion that relations between the HKSAR and Taiwan
are bound to move forward, expressing the hope that both sides will
work to overcome their difficulties.</P>
      <P>Yip, who has been authorized by Tung to liaison with Cheng on Hong
Kong and Taiwan relations, said he has no difficulty in communicating
with Cheng.</P>
      <P>Yip's presence at the party aroused attention, but he behaved

    <HEADLINE>ROC CLOSELY MONITORING BEIJING'S ACTIVITIES IN PARAGUAY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  11  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Premier and Minister of Foreign
Affairs John Chang said on Saturday that the traditional cordial
relations between the Republic of China and Paraguay will not be
affected by the development of Beijing-Asuncion trade ties.</P>
      <P>Chang was commenting on reports that mainland China will open a
commercial office in Paraguay, the only South American country to
recognize Taipei rather than Beijing.</P>
      <P>Chang said the ROC and Paraguay have enjoyed long-standing close
and amicable relations which will not be easily affected by sabotage
by mainland China.</P>
      <P>"Our relations with Paraguay are firm and solid," Chang said,
adding that Paraguayan first lady Maria Teresa Carrasco de Wasmosy is
scheduled to arrive in Taipei on Oct. 15 for a five-day visit at the
invitation of the ROC government.</P>
      <P>Chang went on to say he is convinced that even if Paraguay
reinforces commercial ties with mainland China, it won't have a
serious negative impact on official Taipei-Asuncion relations.</P>
      <P>Mainland China has been courting Paraguay very intensively, in an
attempt to lure away the ROC's sole diplomatic ally in South
America.</P>
      <P>Chang said ROC diplomatic officials have long been closely
monitoring Beijing's activities in Paraguay.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Paraguayan Ambassador Ceferino Valdez Peralta told
CNA on Saturday that Mrs. Wasmosy will be accompanied by several
Paraguayan officials and the wife of Paraguay's minister of foreign
affairs on her Taiwan trip.</P>
      <P>This will be Mrs. Wasmosy's first visit to Taiwan, although her
husband, President Juan Carlos Wasmosy, has visited Taiwan on two
previous occasions.</P>
      <P>While here, Mrs. Wasmosy will meet with President Lee and his
wife and other senior officials, in addition to examining Taiwan's
charity programs. She will also visit Shihtung Elementary School in
suburban Taipei to spend some time with the expatriate Paraguayan
children who are studying there.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC, US HELD HIGH-LEVEL MEETING IN NEW YORK IN AUGUST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 11 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Senior officials from the Republic of China
on Taiwan and the United States met in New York in late August to
discuss matters of mutual concern, sources revealed for the first
time on Saturday.</P>
      <P>According to the sources, Ding Mou-shih, secretary general of the
National Security Council, made an overseas trip before the start of
President Lee Teng-hui's two-week, four-country Latin American tour
in early September.</P>
      <P>The sources said Ding represented Taiwan in high-level
consultations with the United States during his August trip.</P>
      <P>Although Ding himself would not confirm that the purpose of his
trip was to meet with high-ranking American officials, a senior
government official told the CNA that there are no major
stumbling-blocks to high-level dialogue between Taipei and
Washington.</P>
      <P>The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that
despite the absence of formal diplomatic ties, ROC-US communications
channels are smooth and effective. "The two sides can fully exchange
opinions and views on all topics of mutual concern," the official
said.</P>
      <P>The agenda of the August meeting was not divulged, but informed
sources said the topics discussed might have focused on the three-way
Taipei-Washington-Beijing relations.</P>
      <P>In March 1996 when mainland China was conducting missile
tests and war games in waters near Taiwan in the run-up to the
ROC's first-ever direct presidential election, Ding, who once
served as ROC minister of foreign affairs and de facto ambassador to
the US, also made a secret trip to New York to meet with Samuel
Berger, then US deputy national security adviser. Shortly after the
Ding-Berger meeting, the US sent two aircraft carrier battle groups
to waters near the Taiwan Strait and the missile crisis soon ended
peacefully.</P>
      <P>The complex and delicate relations have again become a focus of
attention these days, as mainland China's President Jiang Zemin is
scheduled to make an official visit to the United States in late
October, during which he will meet with US President Bill Clinton to
discuss a variety of issues.</P>
      <P>Jiang will be the first mainland leader to hold a summit meeting
with his American counterpart since the 1989 Tiananmen massacre in
which mainland Chinese troops brutally cracked down on pro-democracy
student demonstrators in Beijing.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is concerned as to whether the upcoming Clinton-Jiang
meeting will undermine ROC national interests. Jason Hu, outgoing ROC
representative to the US, has repeatedly reminded the Clinton
administration that the United States, while engaging with communist
China, should not impair Taiwan's legitimate rights and interests.</P>
      <P>Hu will return to Taipei later this month to assume the ROC's top
diplomatic post as minister of foreign affairs.</P>

(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The leaders of mainland China's State
Council and the People's Bank have warned repeatedly since the turn
of the year that steps must be taken to avert a looming financial
disaster.</P>
      <P>The Chinese Rural Development, Trust &amp; Investment Corp., whose
total assets exceeded 20 billion yuan (US$2.4 billion), was ordered
closed in the first quarter of this year because of illegal lending
and having more than 10 billion yuan (US$1.2 billion) in
irrecoverable credits.</P>
      <P>State-owned enterprises being unable to repay loans has become
common in mainland China, which has worsened the financial situation
there.</P>
      <P>According to the Beijing Financial Times -- sponsored by major
mainland banks, including the People's Bank -- the total amount
various financial organizations loaned illegally last year might
exceed 690 billion yuan (US$83 billion).</P>
      <P>Beijing authorities have thus been on their guard against
financial crises this year. In his State of the Nation report in
March, mainland Chinese Premier Li Peng said "harnessing the stock
and futures markets and enhancing awareness of financial risk" would
be the focus of his administration.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji told a panel discussion at the
National People's Congress that financial systems should support all
efforts to promote law and order and ward off financial crises.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Supreme People's Court and Supreme People's
Procuratorate both stressed their crackdowns against financial
criminals in their annual reports in March.</P>
      <P>Over a hundred experts in the fields of finance and law attending
a recent seminar in Shanghai on the prevention of financial crises
confirmed the crisis facing the mainland banking system.</P>

hopes the attention brought by the prestigious award will put
pressure on more countries to sign a treaty to ban land mines.</P>
      <P>She and the International Campaign to Ban Land Mines share this
year's Nobel Peace Prize, which was announced Friday.</P>
      <P>The United States is the most significant holdout on an
international agreement banning land mines. Canada and its foreign

other countries to sign the treaty. The signing is scheduled to take
place in Ottawa in December.</P>
      <P>Axworthy, along with leading mainland Chinese dissident Wei

Axworthy said with the award in hand, Williams may be able to
mobilize a broader range of people toward the goal.</P>
      <P>The movement to ban land mines was a favorite of Diana, Princess
of Wales. She helped attract media attention to the cause, with trips
this year to Angola and Bosnia.</P>
      <P>The campaign began six years ago, launched by a few
non-governmental aid agencies. Today it is championed by more than
100 countries and 1,000 aid agencies and humanitarian groups.</P>

China have not joined the move championed by Canada, Britain, France,
Germany and other middle powers and smaller countries to ban the

    <HEADLINE>COLUMNIST SEES FLICKERING HOPE FOR TIBETAN LIBERATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa, Oct. 10 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The slaughter of perhaps a million Tibetans
and the continuing occupation of Tibet by mainland China has been one
of the most ignored chapters of a century which is too full of
similar atrocities.</P>
      <P>One Canadian columnist hopes the movie "Seven Years in Tibet,"
which opens in Canada on Friday, will bring a flickering hope for
Tibet's liberation.</P>
      <P>Paul Stanway, writing for the Edmonton Sun, said a half-century
of Tibetan protest has hardly made a dent in the international
indifference.</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama has traveled the world urging governments to put
pressure on mainland China -- to no great effect. Nations like Canada
are more interested in doing business with mainland China than in
complaining about Chinese depredations in one of the world's most
remote countries, Stanway pointed out.</P>
      <P>But that may be about to change. Hollywood has discovered Tibet
and seems set to make it the cause du jour. The are no less than five
other movies about Tibet due to follow "Seven Years" into movie
theaters in the next year, he said.</P>
      <P>For better or worse, people who couldn't find the Himalayas on a
map are about to get a crash course in recent Tibetan history and
international indifference, he noted.</P>
      <P>Would mainland China respond to significant international
pressure to quit Tibet? "We don't know, because there has never been
any. But Tibet is certainly no longer as strategically important as
it once was as a buffer between China and India. It's worth a try,"
he said.</P>
      <P>If Mel "Braveheart" Gibson can give impetus to Scottish
nationalism, maybe Brad Pitt can liberate Tibet. Stranger things have
happened, he said.</P>
      <P>In the movie, Pitt plays the part of Austrian explorer, climber
and national icon Heinrich Harrer, a vocal voice of Tibetan protests
against mainland China.</P>
      <P>Now in his 80s, Harrer has for years been lauded as the epitome
of the new, liberal, post-war Austria. Rugged and fearless, an
Olympic skier, champion golfer and a member of the climbing team that
made the legendary first ascent of the north face of the Eiger -- the
deadliest peak in the Alps -- Harrer was the personification of
Germanic manhood, Stanway said.</P>
      <P>He was also a staunch proponent of Third World development, a pal
of the Dalai Lama and admirer of pacifist Buddhism. Best of all,
perhaps, he had spent the war years in internment in India and exile
in Tibet -- the subject of the movie.</P>
      <P>But renewed media interest in Harrer, spurred by the movie,
prompted the German magazine Stern to take a look into his past. It
turns out he became a Nazi in 1933 and also joined the SS, Stanway
reported.</P>
      <P>However, the movie is not about Harrer's motives for going to
Tibet or whether there may have been some darker agenda (such as SS
boss Heinrich Himmler's nutty belief that Tibetans were lost Aryans
who might assist Germany in driving the British from India).</P>

    <HEADLINE>M'LAND CHINA SUFFERING FROM UNPRECEDENTED UNEMPLOYMENT WOES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  11  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Chinese state-owned enterprises
failed to pay more than 10 million workers their wages in the first
quarter of this year.</P>
      <P>In addition, there are over nine million skilled workers out of
work in mainland China, and an additional 30 million people employed
in state-owned firms are seen as redundant workers who may well lose
their jobs.</P>
      <P>Even the Beijing news media have been reporting that the
unemployment situation in mainland China is of unprecedented
seriousness.</P>
      <P>Since mainland China began implementing reform and open-door
policies 19 years ago, its economy has experienced rapid growth while
employment conditions have worsened. During 1978-1984, the growth
rate of the mainland GDP was 3.3 times that of employment; but during
1985-1993, the difference enlarged almost 13-fold.</P>
      <P>Local officials and heads of state-owned enterprises have
suggested that increasing investment and easing monetary credit would
be the only ways to decrease the deficits of state-owned enterprises
and ease the growth of unemployment.</P>
      <P>But a leading mainland economist, Dai Yuan-chen, opposes that
suggestion and has argued that an over-supply of labor is an old
problem for mainland China and one that will remain in the future.</P>
      <P>However, Dai confessed that state-owned enterprises -- which
employ 80 to 90 percent of the working populace -- not only can't
absorb more workers but also are being forced by two consecutive
years of losses to release redundant workers.</P>
      <P>The high rate of unemployment in mainland China is exacerbated by
the mentality of the unemployed, some of whom prefer receiving a
minimum living allowance from the government to joining the private
sector's work force, Dai said.</P>

      <P>Celebrations of the Republic of China's
Double Tenth National Day were marred Friday evening by a fireworks
accident that left one man dead.</P>
      <P>A Kaohsiung resident identified as Chiang Chin-teh, 36, was

    <HEADLINE>DEVELOPING NATIONS MAY NOT BE REQUIRED TO CUT EMISSIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  Oct. 11 (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A preparatory group for an upcoming United
Nations conference on global climatic change may ignore a United
States request that developing countries be obligated to cut
greenhouse gas emissions after the year 2000, according to a report
from the World Trade Organization (WTO) on Saturday.</P>
      <P>The group plans to recommend that targets for reducing greenhouse
gas emissions be imposed on developed nations in order to combat
global warming. However, they will not be required to take concrete
measures, such as imposing carbon taxes, the report from the
Geneva-based trade regulatory body said.</P>
      <P>This position is being considered in a draft protocol compiled by
the chairman, Raul Estrade Oyuela, who is in charge of mapping out
reduction targets for the third Conference on the Parties of UN
Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be hosted by Japan in
Kyoto from Dec. 1-10.</P>
      <P>Japan, the United States, Australia, Canada and New Zealand
recently discussed the position at ministerial meetings in Honolulu,
and it will be further discussed in talks to be held starting Oct. 22
in Berlin.</P>
      <P>At the urging of pro-business members of the Republican Party,
the US government is demanding that binding targets for reducing
greenhouse gas emissions within a certain period be imposed on
developing countries as well as industrialized nations. But the
chairman did not take up the US request, the WTO report said.</P>
      <P>The chairman is hoping to require not only developed countries
but also nations like South Korea and Mexico to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions under certain conditions.</P>
      <P>He is not planning to include in the protocol a demand by the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) that developed
countries compensate OPEC members because anti-global warming
measures will reduce oil consumption, the WTO report said, citing
opposition by developed nations and the difficulty of arranging such
compensation.</P>
      <P>His draft protocol says deliberations on proposed trading of
quotas for carbon dioxide emissions between developed and developing
countries will be postponed until 2000 or later, the WTO report said.</P>
      <P>It has been proposed that when industrialized countries help
developing nations reduce carbon dioxide emissions through
technological assistance or other measures, the developed countries
should be allowed extra emissions equivalent to the amount of the
reductions.</P>
      <P>At the UN Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, about 150
nations signed a nonbinding convention which aims at reducing
greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2000.</P>
      <P>At the Kyoto conference, signatory countries are scheduled to
adopt a protocol imposing legally binding numerical targets to cut
greenhouse gas emissions beyond 2000.</P>
      <P>The European Union has proposed that global emission targets for
2010 be set 15 percent below 1990 levels.</P>

      <P>Negotiators from Taiwan and the United
States will meet here on Thursday for a new round of talks on the
terms of the island's bid to enter the World Trade Organization
(WTO), sources with the Economic Affairs Ministry said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chen Ruey-long, director general of the Board of Trade (BOFT) and
David Burn, the US Trade Representative Office's director for
Asian-Pacific affairs, will head their respective delegations during
the week-long negotiations.</P>
      <P>Topics to be raised will include Taiwan's system of government
procurements and tariff reductions, as well as the opening of local
agricultural, insurance, stock brokerage, telecommunications and
service markets, the sources said.</P>
      <P>The last round of the talks in January ended in a deadlock after
the US side backtracked on an earlier consensus by demanding that
Taiwan allow imports of additional farm products.</P>
      <P>Moreover, citing an outbreak of mouth-and-foot disease on local
hog farms in March, the US has seized upon the opportunity to urge
Taiwan to open its door wider for the import of pork and related
products, creating more headaches for Taiwan negotiators.</P>
      <P>Taiwan currently allows the import of foreign pork, with the
exception of pork bellies, offal and seasoned pork, at a tariff rate
of 15 percent. It has also set quotas for its import of pork bellies
after gaining WTO membership.</P>
      <P>But the US has asked Taiwan to open its market to all categories
of pork and pork products, and to lower tariffs on these items to 7.5
percent within six years after entering the WTO.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has completed talks with 21 of the 26 WTO member states
which have asked for bilateral negotiations on Taiwan's trade regime
as preconditions for consenting to its admission into the world trade
regulatory body.</P>

      <P>The Southeast Asian Games may soon be no

sports ministers on Saturday, a suggestion was made to change the
name of the competition to the ASEAN Games after Cambodia is admitted
into the grouping.</P>
      <P>Indonesia's State Minister of Youth and Sports Hayono Isman said
after the meeting that Dato Ajit Singh, the outgoing ASEAN
secretary-general, had proposed the idea to him.</P>
      <P>"He said we should consider changing the SEA Games into the ASEAN
Games. And I told him that I would relay his thinking to my fellow
ASEAN ministers," Hayono was quoted by the Jakarta Post as saying.</P>
      <P>The suggestion will be discussed by the 10 ASEAN member countries
individually and then jointly at the first ASEAN Sports Ministerial
Meeting in Kuala Lumpur next month.</P>
      <P>Hayono said the ASEAN Secretariat may not necessarily have to be
involved in the staging of the games even though the event may bear
the organization's name in the future.</P>
      <P>However, no final decision can be taken until Cambodia is
admitted to ASEAN. It was due to join the regional grouping along
with Laos and Myanmar at the ASEAN ministerial meeting in July, but
its application was put on hold after the nation was rocked by
massive internal strife earlier that month.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SEF ASSURED OF ABDUCTED MARINE POLICE OFFICER'S SAFETY ON MAINLAND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 12 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) said
Sunday that it has received assurances that a Taiwan marine police
officer who was abducted to the mainland is safe and recovering in a
hospital from injuries sustained in the incident.</P>
      <P>The SEF had made an urgent appeal to its mainland counterpart,
the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS),
Saturday night for information on the condition of Chuang Cheng-yao.
Chuang was attacked when he and his colleagues attempted to inspect a
mainland fishing boat they suspected of smuggling goods into Taiwan
during a routine patrol in waters near the offshore island of Matsu.</P>
      <P>Chang Liang-jen, SEF deputy secretary-general, said that the
semi-official body has sent a letter to ARATS, requesting that
arrangements be made for Chuang to be flown back to Taiwan via Hong
Kong as soon as his condition permits.</P>
      <P>Chang urged ARATS to investigate the incident and to handle it
in a proper manner.</P>
      <P>Chang said that the SEF has also asked that the Chinese mainland
authorities restrain fishermen under their jurisdiction from entering
into restricted or off-limits waters near Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Saturday's incident is the second such case in which local marine
police patrolling the Taiwan Strait have been abducted to the
mainland.</P>
      <P>On March 8, 1991, three marine police boarded a
iron-hulled mainland fishing boat near Pengchiayu off eastern Taiwan,
whereupon they found a cargo of dry mushrooms and antiques in the
hull which were apparently being smuggled into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>But the three officers were surprised and overcome by the
mainlanders following a melee in which one of the fishermen was shot
dead. The three marine police were subsequently forced to go to
Pingtan, Fujian Province, with the fishing vessel.</P>
      <P>Through arrangements by Red Cross representatives from the two
sides, the three officers, who had been charged and sentenced for
excessive use of force, were repatriated without serving their time
in mainland prisons.</P>
      <P>Chou Hsien-kuang, the officer who had fatally shot mainland
fisherman Lin Wu, was ordered to compensate Lin's family in the
amount of 40,000 renminbi.</P>
      <P>SEF officials said they do not know if mainland authorities will
deal with Chuang's case in a similar manner of "sentence first,
repatriate later."</P>
      <P>A marine police spokesman said that two marine police patrol
boats had come across three suspicious-looking mainland fishing boats
around 5:00 p.m. Saturday, stopping one of them for inspection.</P>
      <P>Mainland Chinese fishermen on the vessel attacked the officers
with axes, wine bottles and clubs as they boarded the boat. Chuang
received an injury to the arm during the scuffle. Another officer,
identified as Chuang Wen-cheng, also received minor injuries.</P>
      <P>As marine police were unable to gain entry to the captain's
cabin, crewmen began to steer the fishing boat toward the mainland.
Eight of the Taiwan officers opted to jump overboard rather than be
taken to the mainland. They were later rescued. The injured Chuang,
however, was forced to go to the mainland with the ship.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND FISHING BOATS IN TAIWAN WATERS CAUSE HEADACHES FOR OFFICIALS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  12  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The problem of mainland vessels entering
Taiwan's waters to fish has become more serious lately, the National
Police Administration (NPA) said Sunday.</P>
      <P>NPA officials said that the number of mainland fishing ships
being turned away by marine police reflects the severity of the
problem, noting that in 1992, officials had sent back 179 mainland
vessels, with the total surging to over 1,200 the following year.</P>
      <P>The number peaked at 2,200 in 1994, and dropped to slightly over
1,800 in 1995.</P>
      <P>They said that mainland Chinese ships have entered Taiwan waters
in droves recently, often in the dozens or hundreds. The fishing
methods used by the trawlers have seriously disrupted the marine
ecology and depleted fishery resources.</P>
      <P>Groups of mainland fishing ships converging on a particular
location not only destabilize fishing operations in the area, but
also give rise to constant disputes over tangled nets.</P>
      <P>The officials said the problem can be attributed in part to
Chinese mainland authorities turning a blind eye to the activities of
fishermen under their jurisdiction. Also, because of the depleted
marine resources, Taiwan operators have given up fishing for
themselves, and have resorted to purchasing the catches of the
mainland fishermen and shipping them back to Taiwan for resale in
local markets.</P>
      <P>The officials said that the problem became worse after some
mainland operators, under the pretext of fishing activities, began to
engage in piracy or use their vessels for smuggling goods and human
cargo into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Mainland spies could also be disguising themselves as fishermen
to collect information on Taiwan's coastal geography, they added.</P>
      <P>The officials said that marine police are now building large
2,000-ton patrol boats to beef up their enforcement capability.
Marine police will also coordinate more closely with naval patrol
vessels to crack down on mainland fishing ships entering Taiwan
waters.</P>
      <P>They also urged local fishing associations to discourage local
fishermen from purchasing the catches of mainland operators.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC STRONGLY REFUTES SAMOAN PM'S ALLEGATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  13 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) on
Monday sternly refuted an allegation by Samoan Prime Minister Tofilau
Eti Alesana that Taiwan has funded an anti-government march to be
staged in his country.</P>
      <P>"Alesana's allegation is unfounded and incorrect," said a
ministry official in charge of East Asian and Pacific affairs who
preferred anonymity.</P>
      <P>The official was commenting on an Agence France-Presse (AFP)
report which quoted Alesana as accusing Taiwan on Sunday of pouring
money into an anti-government organization on Samoa, known as the
Tumua ma Pule.</P>
      <P>Alesana was quoted as claiming that Taiwan provided at least one
million tala (about US$377,000) for the Tumua ma Pule to organize an
anti-government march on Oct. 29 aimed at forcing Alesana to resign.
"Taiwan was doing this in retaliation for Samoa recognizing China,"
the AFP report quoted Alesana as alleging. Alesana, however, declined
to reveal the source of his information.</P>
      <P>Responding to the report, the MOFA official said Samoa is far
away from the Republic of China on Taiwan and has had limited
contacts with the ROC government.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, the official said, the South Pacific island
nation has traditionally maintained close ties with communist China.
For instance, mainland Chinese Vice Premier Zhu Rongji made a
stopover in Samoa during his South Pacific tour earlier this year.</P>
      <P>Noting that the ROC has few interests in Samoa, the official said
that the ROC has never offered any financial aid to opposition groups
in that country. Moreover, he said, the MOFA's annual budget is under
the Legislative Yuan's tight scrutiny. "Alesana's allegation is
totally groundless," he said, adding he suspects that mainland China
might have purposely furnished the Samoan prime minister with
erroneous information.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HUMAN SMUGGLING RING BUSTED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  Oct.  13 (CNA)
(By Debbie Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A human smuggling ring which methodically
transported Chinese mainlanders to Taiwan via Kinmen, was busted by
police Sunday.</P>
      <P>The ring, masterminded by "snake head" Lin Chu-yuan, was found to
have smuggled at least 10 Chinese from the mainland to Kinmen in two
groups since early September this year. The actual number of persons
transported through the sea route and the number of people involved
in the smuggling operation could be much larger, the police said.</P>
      <P>A "snake head" is someone who operates a human smuggling
business, usually charging exorbitant prices.</P>
      <P>Lin, 50, a former representative of Chincheng, the major township
of Kinmen, and two accomplices were nabbed Sunday morning after
Kinmen police captured five illegal mainland immigrants a day
earlier.</P>
      <P>The five mainlanders, three men and two women, said Lin's group
had arranged for them to slip into Kinmen aboard a fishing boat for a
fee ranging from 20,000 to 80,000 renminbi per person.</P>
      <P>After arriving in Kinmen, the five were holed up at a local
hotel, where they were waiting for the smugglers to give them fake
ROC identifications, which are usually forged from stolen IDs
obtained in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The five mainlanders were nabbed before they were able to sneak
into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The police found a similarity with a previous human smuggling
case which was uncovered on Sept. 5, when five other mainlanders were
arrested in Kinmen on charges of violating the ROC's immigration law.</P>
      <P>According to Lin's accomplices, Chen Tsung-ming, 49 and Chen
Chin-chung, 33, the Sept. 5 human smuggling attempt was part of the
same deal arranged by Lin's ring.</P>
      <P>Saturday's crackdown seemed to corroborate persistent rumors of
operators in Kinmen who act as go-betweens for the trafficking of
humans across the Taiwan Strait.</P>

      <P>Hu made the statement Saturday when he was addressing the opening
ceremony of a seminar in Washington D. C.</P>
      <P>He said that Taiwan and Hong Kong, which came under to mainland
Chinese rule on July 1 this year, differ in many ways. Accordingly,
Beijing's "one country, two systems" formula cannot be applied to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In contrast with the colonial history of Hong Kong, the
developmental experience in Taiwan and its democratic achievements
will provide a feasible model for future unification of China, Hu
told the seminar.</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that the handover of Hong Kong to Chinese
rule offers Beijing a direct experience with democracy, enabling
Beijing leadership to clearly evaluate the essence and value of
democracy, which will in turn gradually diminish the resistance to
democracy among the Communist hierarchy.</P>
      <P>Hu said that unification between Taiwan and the mainland will not
be achieved in a single leap, and that Beijing should continue to
pursue reforms in order to narrow the gap between the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait. Only when the fledgling democratic movement in the
mainland reaches full bloom, will conditions be ripe for national
unification.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the policy of pragmatic diplomacy pushed by
Taiwan is not intended to create cross-strait tension or
confrontation. Rather, it arises from a need for Taiwan to secure its
survivability and pursue its developmental goals.</P>
      <P>Hu expressed the hope that both sides of the Taiwan Strait could
put aside their differences on the question of China's representation
in international arena and cooperate for mutual benefit based on
parallel representation.</P>
      <P>On relations with the United States, he said the ROC has gained
the long-term support of the US Congress mainly because the ROC
shares the same beliefs as the US, while lobbying efforts by the ROC
in Washington play a relatively minor role.</P>
      <P>Hu stated that it is "unwise and unnecessary" for the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait to engage in a zero-sum game on Capitol Hill, or
in any other setting.</P>
      <P>He also urged the Beijing authority to resume cross-strait talks
as soon as possible based on the principles of mutual respect and
goodwill. He said that if Beijing merely attempts to block Taiwan's
efforts to gain a greater profile in international community, it will
only delay the peaceful unification of China.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, ROC Executive Yuan officials revealed Sunday that Hu
will return to Taiwan to assume his new position as ROC foreign
minister on Oct. 18.</P>
      <P>Stephen S.F. Chen, deputy secretary-general to the president, who
was originally scheduled to travel to Washington to replace Hu on
Oct. 14, may have to delay his trip because US authorities have yet
to complete the accreditation procedures, the Executive Yuan
officials said.</P>
      <P>John Chang, who was promoted to the vice premiership nearly two
months ago, will officially turn over the concurrently held foreign
minister's post to Hu in a ceremony scheduled for Oct. 20.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING OFFERS TO LIBERALIZE SERVICES MARKET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  Oct.  12 (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing plans next month to tackle one of
the biggest sticking points in its efforts to join the World Trade
Organization (WTO) by submitting long-awaited proposals for
liberalizing its services market, according to reports from the world
trade body Sunday.</P>
      <P>Beijing also promised to abolish agricultural export subsidies as
soon as it joins the Geneva-based WTO and to end all remaining import
licensing requirements once industrialized countries meet their
commitment to remove textiles quotas early next century.</P>
      <P>Long Yongtu, mainland China's vice minister for international
trade, was quoted as saying that he had outlined Beijing's services
proposals to WTO members this week, and that they might be further
refined before being formally submitted.</P>
      <P>Long, currently on a visit to London, will arrive soon in Geneva
for bilateral negotiations with WTO member countries. He was quoted
as saying that the European Union had called the outline "very
comprehensive and positive." However, EU negotiators maintained that
the proposals fell far short of the degree of liberalization required
to satisfy terms for Beijing's WTO entry.</P>
      <P>"The proposals offer a glimmer of hope, but no more. (Communist)
China is going to have to move much further," an EU official was
quoted as saying. "But at least Beijing appears at long last to be
waking up to the importance of trade in services in these
negotiations."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, WTO Director-General Renato Ruggiero warned that
Beijing must agree to open wide its market for goods and services
before it can win its long-sought admission to the world trade
regulatory body.</P>
      <P>Ruggiero suggested Beijing should not assume that any dramatic
moves to settle US concerns during this month's visit to Washington
by President Jiang Zemin would clear all remaining hurdles to WTO
membership.</P>
      <P>"China has to understand that her partners see her as the fifth
exporter in the world ... and so they expect the Chinese market to be
as open as the markets of all its partners are already," Ruggiero
said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA SAID CURTAILING ROC INVITATIONS TO APPEASE CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct.  13 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia is curtailing its invitations
to low-ranking Taiwan government officials to visit in order to
appease mainland China, according to a report by the Australian
Financial Review.</P>
      <P>In a dispatch from Taipei, the Review's Bruce Cheesman reported
that Taiwan was more concerned with Australia's "one China" policy
than with the anti-Asian views of Independent Member of Parliament
Pauline Hanson.</P>
      <P>The daily reported that Canberra sent Resources and Energy
Minister Warwick Parer to attend a business council meeting in Taipei
in a very low-key fashion, unlike the highly visible visit by Primary
Industry Minister John Anderson last year.</P>
      <P>"In paying lip-service to Canberra's 'one China' policy, the
announcement of the (Parer's) visit was delayed until the 11th hour.
Without any fanfare, a marked contrast to the high-profile visit of
Mr. Anderson last year, Mr. Parer did his utmost to be invisible,"
Cheesman wrote.</P>
      <P>"Canberra's kowtowing to Beijing for most of the year led to
speculation that visits by ministers to Taiwan were banned," the
daily reported.</P>
      <P>The daily also said that Australian diplomats forced the
Australian New Zealand Bank to stop the head of the bank's operations
in Taipei, Jeffrey Cox, from visiting China to attend the opening of
a new branch in Beijing.</P>
      <P>The daily reported that Taiwan has admonished Canberra through
its trade offices in Australia for benefiting from rapidly increasing
investment from Taipei without reciprocating through wider support
for the island's bid to break out of its international isolation.</P>
      <P>Taipei has made clear that increased investment from state-run
companies depends upon better servicing of the bilateral trade ties
between Taiwan and Australia.</P>
      <P>The daily said Australia's "one China" policy was becoming more
of a stumbling block for Taipei to boost its ties with Canberra.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN STILL TRYING TO CONTACT ABDUCTED OFFICER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 13 (CNA)
(By Debbie Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) is closely watching developments in a case involving the
abduction of a Taiwan marine police officer to the mainland, Taiwan's
top official in charge of mainland Chinese affairs said Monday.</P>
      <P>MAC Chairman Chang King-yuh said the council has authorized the
semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) to continue its
contacts with the mainland's Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait (ARATS), to ensure the safe return of the officer as
soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The SEF was told that Chuang Chen-yao, who sustained a head
injury during a melee on Saturday aboard a mainland fishing boat
which was suspected of involvement in a smuggling operation, is in
stable condition and receiving medical treatment at the Changlo
Municipal Hospital of Fujian Province.</P>
      <P>However, mainland authorities have refused to allow direct
telephone contact between Chuang and any party on Taiwan, including
members of Chuang's family and SEF officials.</P>
      <P>MAC officials said the most critical issue at the moment is that
mainland authorities have different perceptions from those on Taiwan
regarding Chuang's role as a Taiwan-based marine police officer.</P>
      <P>While Taipei maintains that Chuang was executing his duties
properly, the mainland may hold a different attitude, which could
result in a trial and sentencing for Chuang, in which case the
timetable for his return to Taiwan would be "hard to predict," they
noted.</P>
      <P>According to a marine police spokesman on Sunday, two patrol
boats had come across three suspicious-looking mainland fishing boats
in waters near Matsu around 5:00 p.m. Saturday, stopping one of them
for inspection.</P>
      <P>Mainland Chinese fishermen on the vessel attacked the officers
with axes, clubs and liquor bottles as they boarded the boat. Chuang
sustained injuries to the head and arm during the scuffle. Another
officer also received minor injuries.</P>
      <P>As the marine police were unable to gain entry to the captain's
cabin, crewmen began to steer the fishing boat toward the mainland.
Eight of the Taiwan officers opted to jump overboard rather than be
taken to the mainland. They were later rescued. The injured Chuang,
however, was forced to go to the mainland with the vessel.</P>
      <P>Chuang's abduction to the mainland was not the first such
incident involving marine police. On March 8, 1991, three officers
boarded a mainland fishing boat near Pengchiayu off eastern Taiwan,
whereupon they found a cargo of dry mushrooms and antiques in the
hull which were apparently being smuggled into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>But the three officers were taken by surprise and overcome by the
mainlanders following a melee in which one of the fishermen was
fatally shot. The three Taiwan police were subsequently forced to go
to Pingtan, Fujian, with the fishing vessel.</P>
      <P>Through arrangements by Red Cross representatives from the two
rival sides, the three officers, who had been charged and sentenced
for excessive use of force, were repatriated without serving their
sentences in mainland prisons.</P>
      <P>SEF officials, who are continuing efforts to contact their ARATS
counterparts over Chuang's condition in the wake of Saturday's
incident, said they do not know if the mainland authorities will deal
with Chuang in a similar manner of "sentence first, repatriate
later."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chuang's father, who has tried in vain several times
since Saturday to talk with Chuang over the telephone, appealed to
the MAC to facilitate his travel to Fujian, saying that his son
deserves proper care by the government after he went through the
life-threatening ordeal for his country.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CBC TO CUT RESERVE REQUIREMENT FOR BANKS AT RIGHT TIME</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 13 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Y.D. Sheu, governor of the Central Bank of
China (CBC), said Monday that the CBC will announce a reduction in
the reserve requirement for banks at an appropriate time.</P>
      <P>Sheu made the remarks at a joint meeting of the budget, finance,
foreign and overseas Chinese affairs, and judicial committees in
the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Sheu said that the CBC will carefully evaluate the overall
situation of capital markets, price levels and interest rates in
deciding the best juncture for adjusting the reserve requirements.</P>
      <P>He admitted that current reserve requirements for banks are
slightly too high, but said that the cuts will be carried out in
stages in order to avoid impacting the financial market.</P>
      <P>He said that any time there is a cash shortage in capital
markets, or if interest rates are too high, the CBC will consider
cutting the reserve requirement. However, as there are many tools
currently at the CBC's disposal, it will not cut reserve requirements
for the time being.</P>
      <P>Sheu also said that the CBC has released between US$4 billion and
US$5 billion over the past three months to maintain the stability of
foreign currency markets.</P>
      <P>As to why the CBC has firmly maintained an exchange rate of
NT$28.6 to one US dollar, Sheu said that officials have analyzed the
overall situation and taken into consideration the best interests of
the nation's economic development and export trade.</P>
      <P>Sheu stressed that after financial markets become stabilized, the
CBC will respect market mechanisms and will no longer intervene in
the foreign currency market.</P>
      <P>He also refuted the allegation that the CBC will use its powers
to help create a favorable economic atmosphere for the ruling
Kuomintang before year-end local elections, saying that the CBC
maintains an independent, nonpartisan stance.</P>
      <P>Legislator Hung Hsing-jung had questioned the strength of
Taiwan's foreign currency reserves after the CBC recently dumped
hundreds of millions of US dollars in the foreign currency market.</P>
      <P>Sheu said that Taiwan has a foreign currency reserve of US$87
billion. Taiwan businessmen also invest about US$30 billion in the
mainland, over US$30 billion in Southeast Asia and over US$10 billion
in Europe and the Americas. In total, the level of foreign currency
reserves is approximately US$160 billion, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INDONESIA MAY BECOME ASIA'S LARGEST GOLD PRODUCER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Jakarta, Oct. 13 (CNA)
(By Wu Pin-chiang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Director General of Mining of the Ministry
of Mines and Energy Adjat Sudradjat said Sunday that Indonesia has
the potential to become Asia's largest gold producer.</P>
      <P>In his inaugural speech as a professor at Bandung's University of
Padjadjaran, Adjat based his optimistic outlook on Indonesia's rich
gold resources, political stability and favorable mining policy.</P>
      <P>Adjat said the latest volcanological studies indicate that the
making of volcanoes could simultaneously create mineral resources
within the volcanic areas.</P>
      <P>Based on such a view, Indonesia, which is home to at least 129
active volcanoes and 500 dormant ones, could be quite rich in gold
reserves, he said.</P>
      <P>According to the World Gold's Council's latest data, Indonesia
produces 70 tons of gold per year, below mainland's yearly output of
100 tons.</P>
      <P>Adjat said experts speculate that gold resources could be
discovered soon in 15 volcanic arcs, but thus far mineral resources
have only been found in seven of them.</P>
      <P>The seven potentially gold-rich volcanic arcs include the
Sunda-Banda arc (4,000 km), the Sumatra-Meratus (3,000 km), the
Central Kalimantan arc (1,500 km), the North Sylawesi arc (1,500 km),
and the Irian Jaya arc (1,200 km).</P>
      <P>"Thus, the total area which has potential (mineral resources)
covers between 600,000 to 1.5 million kilometers or 10 percent to 30
percent of Indonesia's total land territory," Adjat was quoted by the
Jakarta Post as saying.</P>
      <P>He said research on Indonesia's 129 active volcanoes are already
available for mining investors to study.</P>
      <P>Adjat said investors could also start exploration on the basis of
a systematic geologic map completed by the Indonesian government in
1996, which covers the entire territory of Indonesia on a scale of
1:100,000 and 1:250,000.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHIANG GIVEN TWO-WEEK LEAVE TO RECONSIDER RESIGNATION BID</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 13 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Defense Minister Chiang Chung-ling said on
Monday he will take a two-week leave to reconsider his resignation
bid.</P>
      <P>Chiang made the remarks after visiting a makeshift memorial hall
at Taipei's Sungshan Airport to pay his tribute to the five Air Force
officers who died in a C-130 transport plane crash last Friday.</P>
      <P>Chiang told the press that he had explained to President Lee
Teng-hui and Premier Vincent Siew the reasons for his resignation.
"Both of them have asked me to stay on and advised me to take a
two-week leave to reconsider."</P>
      <P>The career serviceman-turned-defense minister first tendered his
resignation on Saturday, and again on Sunday, to assume political
responsibility for a spate of military mishaps in recent moths.</P>
      <P>President Lee summoned Chiang to his official residence on Sunday
and asked the minister to remain at his post for the nation's overall
interests.</P>
      <P>Premier Siew also met with Chiang on Monday, strongly urging him
not to step down from his current position.</P>
      <P>Siew was quoted by government spokesman David Lee as having told
Chiang that would not be proper for any senior government officials
to resign before the causes of the recent military plane crashes,
including the crashes of two F-5 jet fighters in Hualien on Sept.
30, are determined.</P>
      <P>The three-star general told the premier that he agreed to take up
his current post some three years ago mainly out of a "sense of
mission."</P>
      <P>"I feel that all criticism directed at the military in the wake
of the Oct. 10 C-130 crash has marred the military's reputation and
my personal dignity," Chiang noted. "This is why I have decided to
leave my post."</P>
      <P>In response, Siew said the Ministry of National Defense is
carrying out several critical projects aimed at
restructuing the Ministry of National Defense, streamlining the armed
forces and establishing an elite deterrent force in the face of
mounting mainland Chinese military threats.</P>
      <P>"This is not a suitable moment for you to quit," Siew was quoted
at telling Chiang. "Our nation needs your service at the moment."</P>
      <P>Siew further said he earnestly hopes that the recent C-130 crash
will prompt the military to comprehensively review its training
system and take effective measures to boost the morale of all
servicemen. "I hope the tragic incident will serve to turn a crisis
into an opportunity in our military training system."</P>
      <P>Chiang, 75, has steadily climbed the ladder of military ranks
since he graduated from the Chinese Army Academy. He has served as
Army commander-in-chief, the vice chief of the General Staff, the
personal chief of staff to the President, and national policy adviser
before assuming his current post in late 1994.</P>
      <P>Military observers said it will be difficult for the government
to find a suitable replacement for Chiang at the moment. His
departure will affect plans to trim military personnel, which will
call for the retirement of a number of general- and colonel-level
officers over the next few years. The program is a sensitive matter,
the observers said, adding that few persons in the military other
than Chiang have both the reputation and senior status needed to
successfully oversee implementation of the plans.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JIANG'S  US  VISIT  NEEDS INTENSE SCRUTINY FROM TAIPEI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.   13   (CNA)
(By Chang Lung &amp; Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The political haggling over the
relationship between Beijing and Washington prior to the state visit
of mainland China's President Jiang Zemin to the United State seems
to have come to an end.</P>
      <P>The bilateral relationship has now been defined as a
"constructive partnership" instead of the "strategic partnership"
which was Beijing's original hope. The changes are being seen as
evidence of the political compromise and diplomatic bargaining that
has been going on.</P>
      <P>Jiang's visit will be the first by a mainland Chinese head of
state to the US in 12 years, following the 1985 visit to Washington
by late mainland President Li Xiannian, so Beijing is attaching
tremendous significance to the visit.</P>
      <P>As far as Jiang is concerned, the visit is a chance to usher in
the "Jiang Era" in the wake of the 15th National Congress of the
Chinese Communist Party and to add to his domestic political assets
by establishing personal international popularity.</P>
      <P>There are differences between the US government and Capitol Hill
(Congress) in terms of "China policy." Weighing the government's
consideration of political reality and the basic contradictions
between this and Congress' attitude towards Beijing, both the US and
mainland China have agreed to establish "constructive partnership"
relations leading into the 21st century instead of the former idea of
"strategic partnership" relations.</P>
      <P>Although there exist many obstacles in Beijing-Washington
relations -- such as human rights, nuclear proliferation, arms sales,
trade deficit, the new US-Japan defense guidelines and most of all,
the "Taiwan Problem" -- improving bilateral relations with Washington
is still Beijing's top priority.</P>
      <P>It is Jiang's understanding that as the Beijing old guard and the
indoctrination of Mao thought are gradually fading from mainland
Chinese society and as the reform and open-door policy have crossed
the point of no-return, there is a long way to go if mainland China
wants to establish a cross-century infrastructure, the prerequisite
of which is to have an appropriate international environment. This
means that a stand against the US and Japan is not in line with the
mainland's strategic goal.</P>
      <P>Jiang Zemin's US visit will not only be a watershed in the
development of relations between Beijing and Washington, it will also

    <HEADLINE>CHICKENS OBEY EX-NAVY LT. COMMANDER'S MILITARY ORDERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hualien,  Eastern  Taiwan, Oct. 13 (CNA)
(By Debbie Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>All feathered two-legged
residents freeze and raise their heads toward Fan, a retired naval
officer, when he whistles his "one short note." They stand to
attention like this for about ten seconds before they resume their
normal activities.</P>
      <P>Fan Kuang-fu, an ex-naval lieutenant commander, operates Taiwan's
most disciplined poultry farm in the mountain village of Shoufeng in
eastern Hualien County and most of his 7,000-odd chickens obey his
whistled commands so accurately that they seem to have received
strict military training.</P>
      <P>When Fan whistles "one short note," which means "attention," the
chickens stand still for about 10 seconds and when he whistles "two
short notes," which means "fall in," the poultry start to approach
the feeding station. However, the chickens do not start to eat until
"three short notes" sounds, which means "chow time."</P>
      <P>So astounding has been Fan's success in training his "chicken
corps" that he was dubbed "the chicken commander of Shoufeng" by a
local farmers' association on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Fan, who ran a business in Kaohsiung after retiring from the
navy, returned to his Hualien County home village to raise chickens
when his business failed.</P>
      <P>This venture also faced defeat in the beginning, when about
one-third of his chickens failed to return home to roost at night.
His stock continued to plummet on a daily basis, even though he
cracked his vocal cords trying to call them home.</P>
      <P>When most of his first batch of 1,000 chickens were gone, he went
down to Hualien City to buy himself a whistle and began passing his
military training on to his chickens.</P>
      <P>Fan soon discovered that the chickens would listen to his
whistle, which cheered him up considerably, but he also found that
the poultry would not "listen to orders," unless they were hungry,
leading him to perfect his two-and-three note command system.</P>
      <P>Today, when Fan buys a new batch of chicks who do not know the
rules, he is not at all worried that they will run off. "The small
ones learn as quickly as little children when they follow their
seniors and it isn't long before they listen too," a proud Fan says.</P>

      <P>Australia's tourism industry is reaping
benefits from forest fires in Indonesia because many tourists are
switching their travel plans to the Gold Coast and Cairns in
Queensland, Australian travel agents reported on Monday.</P>
      <P>Many leisure trips to Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand

two months and resorts on the Gold Coast and in Cairns are already
reaping some of the benefits, they said.</P>
      <P>Many members of the expatriate community in Southeast Asia have
also moved to the relative safety of Australia until the haze
covering large parts of the region clears, they said.</P>
      <P>Other Australian tourist destinations, including Sydney and

      <P>The fires have produced heavy smoke that has spread to Malaysia,
Singapore and Thailand, causing serious air pollution.</P>
      <P>The Australian Tourism Commission said travel agents in Australia
should take the opportunity to attract more tourists from Southeast

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Members of the Chinese community in
Sydney have asked the New South Wales Ethnic Communities Council to
organize a forum to teach them how to protect themselves from racist
attacks and defuse the potentially violent situations which racism
can spark.</P>
      <P>The council said other ethnic groups, including the Korean and
Vietnamese communities, have asked to participate in the forum.</P>
      <P>The forum, the first of its kind, will be held in late November
or early December and will be aimed at teaching Asian groups the
skills needed to protect themselves in potentially violent
situations.</P>
      <P>A council spokesman said the Chinese community often has to bear
the brunt of much of the harassment and taunting that occurs on a
daily basis and that the forum "will teach Chinese how to deal with
everyday racism. If this forum succeeds, we hope it will be copied by
other groups."</P>
      <P>Racial harassment has increased since Independent Member of
Parliament Pauline Hanson said in September 1996 that "Australia is
in danger of being swamped by Asians." She demanded that the
government stop Asian immigration. As a result, the Australian
government has reduced the intake of immigrants to 72,000 in 1997-98,
down from nearly 100,000 in 1996-97.</P>
      <P>Ethnic Affairs Commission chairman Stepan Kerkyasharian said it
is important for ethnic communities to know what protection they
have, including racial vilification legislation.</P>
      <P>"It is a sad reflection on our society that some community groups
now feel the need to give themselves these tools so they can confront
racism in an effective way," he said.</P>
      <P>"It is true that Asian Australians are a visible group and
therefore more susceptible to racism than other communities at the
moment," he added.</P>

      <P>Taipei, Oct. 13 (CA) Taiwan's deficits in trade with Japan
amounted to US$11 billion in the first three quarters of this year,
according to statistics compiled by the Ministry of Economic
Affairs.</P>
      <P>The deficits is expected to reach US$16 billion this year, an

      <P>Taiwan's trade deficits with Japan increased from US$9.67 billion
in 1991 to US$17.11 billion in 1995, a sharp increase of 76 percent
in four years. The deficits dropped to US$13.83 billion in 1996,
mainly because of the increase in the export of information products
to Japan.</P>
      <P>But the deficits began to rise again early this year due to an
outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, which depleted Taiwan's pork
export to Japan, and due to a sharp reduction in Japan's import of
information products from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's trade deficits with Japan is attributable to a
"structural imbalance" in trade between the two countries, the
official said.</P>
      <P>He said the ministry is expected to map out "a plan to promote
foreign trade with Japan as a main target" by the end of this year,

deficits with Japan in vain. (by Ed Hsieh)</P>

      <P>Vice President Lien Chan returned home
Monday afternoon after concluding his unofficial visit to Iceland and

      <P>The Republic of China's foreign trade
reached US$174.09 billion in the first three quarters of this year, a

indicated.</P>
      <P>As a result, Taiwan registered a trade surplus of US$5.47 billion
in the January-September period, a decrease of 46 percent. Officials
of the Finance Ministry attributed the decline to the faster growth
of imports, reflecting brisk domestic demand for foreign raw
materials and equipment for production expansion.</P>
      <P>The United States was the major overseas market for Taiwan
products, taking 24 percent of the island's total exports in the
period. It was followed by Hong Kong with 23 percent and Europe with
14.7 percent, the statistics showed. Important suppliers to Taiwan
included Japan, the United States and Europe.</P>
      <P>In September alone, the nation's foreign trade hit US$20.62

      <P>Exports last month hit US$10.87 billion, up 10.7 percent, and

      <P>A total of 240, or 17.43 percent, of the foreigners who committed
crimes were illegal workers here, while 755, or 54.82 percent were
legal workers, the statistics showed.</P>
      <P>The CLA also indicated that as of September, a total of 9,287
foreign workers were listed as having run away from their Taiwanese
employers, adding that some 95 percent of those who were caught
during the same month have been sent back home by local law
enforcement authorities.</P>
      <P>Theft was the most common crime among foreign workers, with 319
of them involved in 204 cases of this during the
three-and-a-half-year period, the figures showed.</P>
      <P>There were 83 foreign workers involved in a total of 54 cases of
homicide during the same period, the CLA said, noting this is a

    <HEADLINE>WORLD FORESTRY CONGRESS OPENS IN TURKEY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ankara,  Oct. 13, (CNA)
(By  Kuo Chuan-hsin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Under the auspices of the United Nation's
Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the 11th World Forestry
Congress opened Monday in Antalya, southern Turkey.</P>
      <P>More than 2,000 experts from over 150 countries gathered to
debate current and future problems facing the forestry industry
worldwide and to recommend global solutions.</P>
      <P>The opening ceremony was chaired jointly by Turkish President
Suleyman Demirel, Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz and FAO Director
General Dr. Jacques Diouf. Their speeches emphasized that the world's
soil, air and water resources are vital for all forms of life, and
that the forests -- the "lungs of the world" -- are both the source
and the preserver of these resources. However, they said, human
activity is rapidly exhausting the planet's natural resources.</P>
      <P>Conference organizers from Turkey's Forestry Ministry said that
the general theme for the gathering is "Forestry for Sustainable
Development: Towards the 21th Century." Related topics will be
discussed by experts from around the world in 77 sub-sessions during
the Oct. 13-19 congress.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Turkish Forestry Ministry will also hold an
exhibition titled "International Forestry and Forest Products," and a
memorial forest park will be established, where the participants will
plant floral specimens from their own counties.</P>
      <P>The first World Forestry Congress was organized by the
International Forestry Institute in 1926 in Rome, and subsequent
meetings have been held in Budapest, Helsinki, Seattle, Madrid,
Buenos Aires, Jakarta, Mexico City and Paris. The previous 10th
Congress was once again held in Rome in June 1995.</P>

(By Kuo Chuan-hsin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Turkish troops have achieved their
objectives in an operation codenamed "Dawn '97," aimed at destroying
guerrilla positions of the rebel Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), and
have begun withdrawing from northern Iraq on Monday, the
semi-official Anatolia news agency reported.</P>
      <P>The operation accomplished all of its aims and the region has
been "cleared of the majority of PKK terrorists," the commanders in
charge of the offensive were quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>The number of PKK separatists killed during the operation, which
started at the end of September with the aim of eliminating the
guerrilla fighters who use northern Iraq as a base from which to
strike Turkey, was put at 816. Also, 18 rebels were captured, 17
surrendered, and a considerable amount of ammunition and food were
also seized, Anatolia said, quoting military sources.</P>
      <P>The number of Turkish government troops killed in the clashes was
put at 15, with 58 soldiers reported injured.</P>
      <P>Some Turkish forces will remain in northern Iraq to guard the
border, supported by fighters of the Iraqi Kurdistan Democratic
Party, to prevent the PKK separatists from infiltrating the area and
taking it under their control again, the military sources said.</P>
      <P>The PKK has been engaged in a bloody separatist campaign against
the Turkish government since 1984. Centered in the southeast of
country, the conflict has left more than 26,000 people dead over the
past 13 years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>UNIQUE MOBILITY TO BUILD LARGE APU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  Oct.  13  (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Unique Mobility Inc. of the United
States, one of the world's leading developers of power systems for
electric and hybrid electric vehicles, announced Monday plans to work
with Deere &amp; Co. and others to build a state-of-the-art,
diesel-fueled auxiliary power unit (APU) for large hybrid-electric
vehicles.</P>
      <P>The Colorado-based company said in a press release that it has
received an award of US$292,000 from the U.S. Defense Department to
work on the project.</P>
      <P>To build the APU, Unique Mobility will mate its new 75 KW (100
HP) permanent magnet motor generator, developed in collaboration with
the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, with an 88 KW (118 HP)
six-cylinder 6.8-liter diesel engine manufactured by Deere &amp; Co., the
document says, adding that Unique will also provide the power
electronics and microprocessor controller required to run the system.</P>
      <P>Large APUs could be used for buses, shuttles and medium duty
trucks. They could also have applications on military, agricultural,
construction and other off-road vehicles. These include crop
harvesters, dirt excavators, passenger and product movers and other
machines where an electric transmission will improve fuel economy,
increase versatility and maneuverability, William Rankin, president
of Unique Mobility, said in the press release.</P>
      <P>For military applications, he continued, the APU can provide
standby electric power, eliminating the need for the vehicle to tow
or carry a separate generator.</P>
      <P>A primary goal of this program is to develop a complete APU
package -- an engine, generator, controls and mounting that can be
provided to vehicle manufacturers interested in producing hybrid
electric drive vehicles, Rankin added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan and Singapore will hold another
round of talks Oct. 27 on terms for Taiwan's entry into the World
Trade Organization (WTO), Chen Ruey-long, director general of the
Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT), said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chen said the talks will be held when representatives from the
two nations attend the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
forum's Special Senior Officials Meeting in Singapore, scheduled for
Oct. 27-28.</P>
      <P>During the talks, Singapore is expected to present a list of 40
industrial products, including petrochemical, electric and
electronics items, for which Singapore hopes that Taiwan will cut
tariffs, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Singapore will also request that Taiwan open maritime auxiliary
services, including sea cargo handling, storage and warehousing in
ports, agency services, freight forwarding and container station and
depot services.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and Singapore reached a preliminary agreement during
ministerial-level talks last year to complete the maritime services
talks before the year 2000. But Chen said that because a global
framework has yet to be completed, it is doubtful that Taiwan can
make any promises in that area in the absence of such an agreement.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has completed negotiations with 21 of 26 WTO signatory
nations which have requested bilateral talks over the past four
years, and is hoping that talks with the remaining members can be
completed soon.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  14  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew said Tuesday that
Taiwan cannot decide unilaterally when talks between the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait will resume.</P>
      <P>Siew made the remarks before the Legislature in response to
reports that a task force on mainland relations, which has been idle
for some time, will be back in action soon.</P>
      <P>The reports surfaced following recent remarks by leaders on both
sides of the Taiwan Strait appealing for the resumption of talks.</P>
      <P>But, Siew said Taiwan cannot decide unilaterally either the
timetable or the agenda for such talks. At the moment, only the
cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) is making necessary
preparations. If necessary, it will submit its proposals to the task
force.</P>
      <P>Siew said that the task force was set up to coordinate and
integrate mainland policy between various government agencies. It
will be convened by the vice premier on an irregular basis and will
have no specific agenda.</P>
      <P>Siew said many problems arise in the course of cross-trait
exchanges, but the issues often remain unresolved because of a lack
of consultation channels. He said that if technical issues cannot be
worked out, it will be more difficult to build mutual trust.</P>
      <P>On discussions regarding direct shipping links across the Taiwan
Strait, Siew said that the issue is not limited to matters of
commercial interest and expediency.</P>
      <P>He said that only on the premises of national security and
dignity will it be feasible to discuss such issues.</P>
      <P>Siew also said that, given the fact of separate rule on Taiwan
and the mainland, the sovereignty of the Chinese nation should be
shared by the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. He said that
if mainland China can cast away its hegemonic mentally, it should not
be too difficult to diffuse the row across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chu Feng-chih of the ruling Kuomintang suggested that
the Republic of China mobilize all private groups of friendly nations
in Europe and the Americas to push for increased ROC involvement in
the international community.</P>
      <P>Siew lauded her suggestion, saying that participation in
multilateral organizations has always been a policy objective of the
government, including its bid to rejoin the United Nations and the
World Trade Organization.</P>
      <P>He added that the ROC hopes to share its developmental experience
with other nations so as to repay the international community for the
assistance it has received in the past.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AIR FORCE TOP BRASS CALLS FOR MORE POPULAR SUPPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  14  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Air Force Commander-in-Chief Gen. Huang
Hsien-yung said on Tuesday he has asked his superiors to discipline
him for the crash of a C-130 transport plane at Taipei's Sungshan
Airport on Oct. 10, in which five Air Force officers were killed.</P>
      <P>Huang made the statement after attending a joint funeral service
for the five officers.</P>
      <P>"As the top commander, I must assume responsibility for any
accident or mishap in the Air Force. But I can't offer to resign.
It's the authority of the president or the chief of the General Staff
to order me to quit. I can only ask my superiors to reprimand me,"
Huang told the press.</P>
      <P>Huang's remarks were seen as a response to demands by some
lawmakers that he resign to take the responsibility for a spate of
tragic mishaps involving the Air Force in recent weeks, including the
crashes of two F-5 jet fighters in the mountainous region of eastern
Taiwan near Hualien on Sept. 30.</P>
      <P>Huang said that on Monday he presented to Gen. Lo Pen-li, chief
of the General Staff, a report recommending a reprimand for himself
over the C-130 crash and other accidents that have befallen his
branch of service.</P>
      <P>Huang said he could not agree with the view held by some
lawmakers that Defense Minister Chiang Chung-ling should step down to
assume responsibility for the recent military mishaps. "The demand is
unreasonable and unjustifiable," he claimed, adding that the minister
is responsible for formulating military buildup policy and planning.
"Under Chiang's leadership, our second-generation military buildup
plan has been completed and our air defense capabilities have been
beefed up. I see no reason for Chiang to quit at the moment."</P>
      <P>Huang said the Air Force is conducting an overall review of its
operations, management and training. "We have sent to the United
States the flight recorder installed on the crashed C-130 transport
for decoding. After the data contained in the device are available,
we'll give the public a detailed report on the cause of the crash."</P>
      <P>The Air Force has also asked China Airlines to help decode a
voice recorder, which records all conversations in the aircraft
cabin. "The data, expected to become available within a week, may
also help us determine the cause," Huang said.</P>
      <P>On the basis of data available at the moment, several factors,
including inadequate training, the pilot's failure to abide by flight
regulations, bad weather and possible errors on the aircraft's
instrument panel, might have contributed to the crash.</P>
      <P>Huang further said that some of the most critical questions may
concern potential deficiencies in training procedures at the Air
Force's wing-level units.</P>
      <P>Huang said the Air Force General Headquarters has drafted a plan
to discipline wing-level units in accordance with military
regulations. The report will be made public after being approved by
the General Staff Headquarters, he added.</P>
      <P>In the wake of the incident, Huang said, the Air Force has
examined its operations and management at all levels. "We have found
that training for junior pilots must be reinforced," Huang said,
adding that the Air Force has decided that all junior pilots must
pass stringent qualification tests before they will be allowed to fly
the country's newly acquired second-generation warplanes.</P>
      <P>Huang admitted that the recent series of tragic accidents did
have some adverse impact on the Air Force morale. "But the
phenomenon will be temporary, and I earnestly hope that the general
public will give more support and encouragement to all Air Force
staff."</P>
      <P>Huang also refuted speculation that an occasional mishap
involving Air Force combat planes would undermine Taiwan's air
defense capabilities. "Such speculation is unfounded," Huang said,
assuring the public that with the gradual full deployment of
second-generation warplanes, Taiwan can sustain its current air
supremacy over the mainland for five to eight years.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China's Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) is to publish an article in its
Cross-Straits Relations Monthly that explains Beijing's standpoint on
cross-Taiwan Strait political negotiations and marks a new propaganda
offensive aimed at luring Taipei into such talks.</P>
      <P>Reports have said that the October issue of the monthly, to be
published later this month, urges early political negotiations
between Taipei and Beijing.</P>
      <P>The main points of Yu Liwen's "Starting Early Political
Negotiations to Promote the Development of Cross-Strait Relations"
were released Monday through Xinhua, the official mainland news
agency, and in Tuesday's overseas edition of the People's Daily,
indicating that Beijing views the article as highly significant.</P>
      <P>The article reportedly covers the timing, mutual understanding
and steps necessary for political negotiations between the two sides.
It stresses that ARATS and Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation can
discuss the protocol for political negotiations, which signals that
Beijing has appointed ARATS to pioneer such cross-strait talks.</P>
      <P>Beijing has been increasing its efforts on the Taiwan issue since
the handover of the former British colony of Hong Kong to mainland
rule on July 1. In his political report at the 15th National Congress
of the Chinese Communist Party, mainland Chinese President Jiang
Zemin discussed with unprecedented length the relationship across the
Taiwan Strait and urged Taipei to respond soon to his call for
political negotiations.</P>
      <P>Later, mainland Chinese Vice Premier Qian Qichen also said he
hopes Taipei authorities will engage Beijing in a dialogue on
procedures concerning political negotiations between the two sides.</P>
      <P>These high-level statements and the fact that the monthly organ
of ARATS, an association under the Taiwan Affairs Office of the
mainland State Council, is to publish the aforementioned article all
reflect that Beijing is pushing for progress on China's
reunification.</P>
      <P>As part of its attempt to achieve a breakthrough in cross-strait
political negotiations, Beijing has advanced three "understandings"
for proceeding with these talks: adherence to the "One China
principle," though its political meaning can be left behind; equal
negotiations under this principle; and allowing no interference from
the outside world in the talks.</P>

    <DATELINE>Tainan  Oct.  14  (CNA)
(By Lawrence Chu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's ASE Group, a major packager and
tester of semiconductors, on Tuesday unveiled an ambitious NT$340
billion (US$11.9 billion) investment plan aimed at capturing 17
percent of the global semiconductor packaging market and 16 percent
of the global semiconductor testing market by the year 2010.</P>
      <P>Under the plan, the consortium will establish facilities in the
new Tainan Science-Based Industrial Park, the announcement said.</P>
      <P>One of Taiwan's biggest consortiums, the ASE Group currently
controls three major stock-issuing companies: Advanced Semiconductor
Engineering Inc., which is listed on the Taiwan bourse, and Fulei
Electronics and Hungching Construction, both of which are traded on
the US stock exchange.</P>
      <P>At present, the mainstay of ASE's semiconductor production is in
its plant in the Nantzu Export Processing Zone outside Kaohsiung,
southern Taiwan. Other facilities in Penang, Malaysia and the
Philippines supplement the Taiwan plant's output.</P>
      <P>ASE is currently the world's second largest manufacturer of
integrated circuit (IC) packaging equipment.</P>
      <P>ASE Chairman Jason Chang told reporters the investment plan is
necessary due to the Kaohsiung facility's inability to meet expected
future demand amid rising expansion in the global semiconductor
sector.</P>
      <P>Chang predicted that by 2010 the Taiwan ASE plants alone will
hold 13 percent of the global IC packaging market, with business
growing at an astonishing rate of 25 percent per annum.</P>
      <P>By the same year, the ASE IC testing operations on Taiwan should
control 12 percent of the world market, with business growing at an
average of 32 percent a year, he said.</P>
      <P>Combined with the consortium's overseas operations, ASE's IC
packaging and testing operations are expected to bring in some
NT$479.5 billion (US$16.8 billion) in revenues in the year 2010.</P>
      <P>By that year, the consortium will employ some 56,000 people
worldwide and command 17 percent of the global IC packaging market
and 16 percent of the world IC testing market, he said.</P>

      <P>Officials in the former Yugoslavia, Rwanda or Burundi are
accustomed to international visitors sifting through evidence of
rights abuses, the Journal said. But the United States is rarely such
a prominent target. Ndiaye is only the second such U.N. monitor to
visit the United States; the first came in 1994, to probe racial
discrimination.</P>
      <P>Ndiaye's trip has clearly made U.S. officials uncomfortable, and
it was even suspected as being "an intentional insult to the United
States and our nation's legal system" by Sen. Jesse Helms, chairman
of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, according to the Journal.</P>
      <P>For his part, Ndiaye says he was "quite disappointed" that few
federal officials would see him, noting that the State Department
issues an annual survey of human rights abuses by other countries.
But Ndiaye had audiences with lower-level officials at the
departments of State and Justice, and the State Department wrote
letters to prisons urging that he be granted access. And at state and
local levels, Ndiaye has had better luck.</P>
      <P>Washington is a signatory to various international agreements
that cite the death penalty as being a violation of the right to
life, urging that it be applied only in exceptional cases, and be
banned outright in cases involving juvenile offenders.</P>
      <P>But at a time when the United Nation's top human rights body is
urging countries to work toward abolishing the death penalty,
executions are on the rise in the United States, the Journal pointed
out.</P>
      <P>Fifty-seven prisoners have been executed in the United States so
far this year, surpassing the total of 56 executions carried out in
all of 1995, the highest number recorded in a single year since the
Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment in the 1970s.</P>
      <P>"Only China has expanded death penalty laws at the same rate,"
Ndiaye says. And Beijing has not granted him permission to visit.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SINGAPORE FIRMS BOOST STAKES IN FOREIGN COMPANIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,   Oct.   14  (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore companies invested an
additional S$4.3 billion to buy shares of foreign companies in 1995,
according to a study by the Singapore Department of Statistics.</P>
      <P>This resulted is a hefty 60 percent jump in the holdings of
foreign equity shares by Singapore companies as of the end of 1995,
compared to the previous year.</P>
      <P>The study showed that Singapore-based companies owned S$11.6
billion worth of quoted and unquoted shares in companies abroad at
the end of 1995, up from S$7.3 billion worth of shares owned a year
earlier.</P>
      <P>The big increase in foreign share investments was in fact
responsible for a significant 34 percent jump in portfolio
investments during the year.</P>
      <P>At last count, Singapore's portfolio investment abroad amounted
to S$16.1 billion, representing one-sixth of the country's stock of
investments overseas.</P>
      <P>Portfolio investments comprise investments in paid-up shares of
companies in which the investor has no influence over policies, as
well as in preference shares, bonds, debentures and other securities
issued by foreign governments and overseas companies.</P>
      <P>The study, titled Singapore's Investment Abroad 1994-95, covered
some 3,300 Singapore-based companies with investments overseas. It
had been expanded to include the financial sector.</P>
      <P>Consequently, information for the overall corporate sector's
investment abroad has become available for the first time, the
Statistics Department said.</P>
      <P>Overall, the study showed that Singapore's external wing
continued to expand vigorously, with total foreign investments up a
robust 12 percent in 1995.</P>
      <P>By the end of 1995, the total value of foreign assets owned by
Singapore's corporate sector was estimated at S$97.7 billion --
equivalent to about 80 percent of the country's gross national
product (GNP).</P>
      <P>GNP measures the total value of goods and services produced by a
country in a year, and includes remittances from Singaporeans
overseas.</P>
      <P>The department said that Singapore's stock of total direct
investment abroad amounted to S$46.2 billion at the end of 1995, up
21 percent over the previous year.</P>
      <P>Its share of total investment abroad increased from 44 percent at
the end of 1994 to 47 percent at the end of 1995.</P>
      <P>The increase was due mostly to growth in direct investment by
Singapore companies expanding and acquiring equity interest in
overseas affiliates (S$5.7 billion) and by reinvestment of profits
(S$1.4 billion), the department said.</P>
      <P>As a proportion of total investment abroad, portfolio investment
rose from 14 percent to 17 percent while investment in other foreign
assets decreased from 42 percent to 36 percent over the same period.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OTTAWA OFFERS LITTLE HOPE OF EARLY END TO MAERSK DUBAI SAGA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Oct.  13  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A major Canadian newspaper said Monday
that, 19 months after the Maersk Dubai saga began in Halifax, a legal
life buoy still eludes the four Filipino sailors and Taiwan's
prosecutor.</P>
      <P>The Canadian government is offering players in the high-sea
murder drama little hope of bringing court wrangling to a speedy
conclusion, The Globe and Mail reported.</P>
      <P>The four Filipinos, who testified in a Halifax court that they
saw three Romanian stowaways thrown overboard the Taiwanese container
vessel, have sought refugee status in Canada. However, there is still
no word on their applications 90 days after hearings concluded last
Friday, the daily said in a dispatch from Halifax.</P>
      <P>Like unwanted castaways, the four sailors may share a sense of
being adrift as they wait in Halifax to learn their fate, it said.
"On the other side of the world, Taiwan's investigation" into the
murder allegations against the ship's skipper and five other officers
"also seems to be listing badly," it added.</P>
      <P>In both instances, part of the explanation seems to lie in
Ottawa, which last week lost another round -- probably the last -- in
a long series of court battles generated by the Dubai saga, according
to the report.</P>
      <P>In the unhappy view of the Taiwanese government, the same
Canadian Department of Justice that promised to help fell short when
Taipei came looking for assistance last month, it pointed out.</P>
      <P>It quoted Eddie Greenspan, a Toronto lawyer whose services were
retained by Taiwan, as saying, "We thought and understood there would
be full cooperation from the RCMP (Royal Canadian Mounted Police) and
federal government.... The reception was less than favorable, almost
downright rude."</P>
      <P>The daily said that complicating everything was the peculiar
status of Taiwan, "an international oddity that enjoys excellent
trade relations with Canada but no diplomatic recognition." This may
help explain why Ottawa has not been helpful to Taiwan's prosecutor
Richard Su, who came to Ottawa early last month hoping to interview
the four Filipinos, key witnesses in the whole incident.</P>
      <P>In their series of short meetings, according to Greenspan,
Canadian officials barely gave Su the time of day. Rather, they
merely reiterated that the Filipinos had nothing to say, the report
said.</P>
      <P>"We're not asking for an act of recognition, we're asking for
some assistance," Greenspan was quoted as saying. "There's a lot of
things the Canadian government could do for the Filipino crew members
to make it easier to facilitate their attendance.</P>
      <P>"They could even indicate they would look favorably on their
admission into the country, if they were to cooperate. There are
carrots, and that's the ultimate carrot."</P>
      <P>Su has been trying to get them to testify in a Taiwan court. They
have refused to go, on the ground that death threats have been made
to them and their families in the Philippines. And Su could not even
meet them in Canada, as Ottawa refused to help him.</P>
      <P>The Filipinos testimony is critical for Su's probe into the case.
"If they don't come here, it will be very difficult for the judge to
find the captain guilty," Su said in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan.</P>

    <DATELINE>New  York, Oct. 13 (CNA)
(By Ranan Huang &amp; Lawrence Chu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Aero Industry Development Corp.
(AIDC) and the US-based Sikorsky Helicopter Corp., one of the world's
biggest manufacturers of helicopters, signed a strategic alliance
Monday.</P>
      <P>The pact was inked at Sikorsky's Connecticut headquarters by
Eugene Buckley, president of the US firm, and, on behalf of the AIDC,
by Yin Chi-ming, the Republic of China on Taiwan's vice minister of
Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>Under the agreement, Sikorsky will explore avenues of cooperation
with the state-run Taiwan firm in the hope of expanding both firms'
shares of the Asia-Pacific and global markets.</P>
      <P>Sikorsky became the 49th major multinational firm to sign a
strategic alliance with Taipei under the ROC Ministry of Economic
Affairs' efforts to transform Taiwan into a major manufacturing
center of the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Sikorsky was also the first helicopter manufacturer to sign a
strategic alliance agreement with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In remarks delivered after the signing ceremony, Yin said the
agreement would surely bring many benefits to both sides while also
raising the standard of technology in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As one of the world's biggest helicopter manufacturers, with
sales operations in some 45 countries worldwide, Sikorsky has
promised to consider jointly developing the S-92 mid-sized transport
helicopter with the AIDC, Yin said.</P>
      <P>Yin also promised Sikorsky's president that Taiwan would be the
ideal partner for the firm in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Responding to Yin, Buckley said his company regards its strategic
alliance with Taiwan as very important and that it has made future
strategic cooperation with the island a major priority.</P>
      <P>By strengthening bilateral cooperation, both sides can cope with
the challenges in the increasingly globalized international market
and achieve results that will satisfy all, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW ROC ENVOY TO LEAVE FOR US THURSDAY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.   14  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Newly appointed Republic of China
Representative to the United States Stephen Chen is scheduled to
leave for Washington, D.C. on Thursday evening to assume his new
post.</P>
      <P>The Clinton administration is expected to formally inform the ROC
government of its consent to Chen's appointment on Wednesday morning,
sources said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chen, incumbent deputy secretary-general to President Lee
Teng-hui, will succeed Jason Hu, who has been appointed minister of
foreign affairs.</P>
      <P>Chen, a career diplomat, will be the ROC's seventh de facto
ambassador to the United States since the two countries severed
diplomatic relations in 1979.</P>
      <P>President Lee is scheduled to preside over a swearing-in ceremony
for Chen on Thursday morning. The new envoy to the US will then
attend a luncheon hosted by Legislative Yuan President Liu Sung-fan
in his honor. During the luncheon, Chen is expected to brief members
of the legislature's Foreign Affairs Committee on his plans for his
new office.</P>
      <P>Chen paid a visit to Premier Vincent Siew on Monday, bidding
farewell to the premier and receiving instructions from him
concerning his new assignment.</P>
      <P>During their 30-minute talks, Siew emphasized the importance of
ROC-US relations and urged Chen to continue promoting bilateral
exchanges and cooperation based on the successes already achieved.</P>
      <P>In addition to reinforcing contacts with the US executive branch
and Congress, Siew asked Chen to also boost engagements with the
academic, commercial and industrial communities, as well as the major
US think tanks and media organizations.</P>
      <P>Chen, who has previously served a four-year stint as the ROC's
deputy representative to the United States, said in a recent
interview with the CNA that "do more and talk less" is the most
important working guideline for engaging the United States, adding it
is equally important to know how to "talk."</P>
      <P>Touching on the establishment of a high-level dialogue channel
between Taipei and Washington, Chen said cultivation of mutual trust
is most critical. "Mutual trust and understanding will help ensure
smooth communications."</P>
      <P>With more than 30 years of service in the diplomatic arena, Chen
is no stranger to mainland China's incessant efforts to block and
squeeze Taiwan's presence in the international community.</P>
      <P>Chen said he looks upon his new assignment as a challenge, adding
that he will encourage all ROC officials stationed in the United
States to work out innovative strategies to help cement bilateral
ties and expand cooperation in various fields.</P>
      <P>Observers said Chen's first test will come in the first few days
of his new job, as mainland China's President Jiang Zemin is
scheduled to leave for the United States on Oct. 26 for a state
visit, during which Jiang will hold a summit meeting with President
Bill Clinton, the first top-level tete-a-tete between the two sides
since 1989.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CARD-SIZE PCS TO OPEN NEW DIMENSION IN INDUSTRIAL COMPUTERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  14  (CNA)
(By Debbie Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Fully coming to grips with the trend of
"miniaturization," researchers at the Industrial Technology Research
Institute (ITRI) have successfully created "card-size" 486 PCs, an
innovation which is poised to open up a new sphere of applications
for industrial computers.</P>
      <P>After months of R&amp;D, engineers at ITRI's Computer and
Communications Research Lab have recently made a breakthrough in IC
package technology by developing the know-how to produce a 0.75 mm
ball-grid array (BGA), said Ho Tsung-cheh, a section chief at the
lab.</P>
      <P>The 0.75 mm BGA helps to miniaturize the chipsets and integrate
key components into a high-density, compact unit, making the PCs very
small -- about the size of a cigarette pack -- but highly functional
and reliable, Ho said.</P>
      <P>The research engineers encountered a number of problems in the
miniaturization and integration process, mainly involving overheating
and interruption, he noted, adding that when the 8.5cm x 5.4cm x
1.6cm PCs are connected to display panels and keyboards, they make
perfect controllers for industrial systems, including automatic
machinery, portable testing equipment and medical examining
equipment.</P>
      <P>The lab expects to produce card-size 586 Pentium PCs in March
next year, and the still more cutting-edge 686 Pentium II models in
later months, he added.</P>
      <P>The card-size 486 PCs will debut at the 1997 Taipei International
Electronics Show which opens Thursday at the Taipei World Trade
Center.</P>

Republic of China said here Tuesday.</P>
      <P>He said they are interested in setting up offices in Shanghai,

      <P>Australia's human resources could make it
"the brain trust" of Asia, according to Dr. Kenichi Ohmae, one of the
world's best known management consultants.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the Australian Financial Review, the leading
business daily in Australia, Ohmae said Australia's greatest
competitive strength is not in minerals and agriculture but its
"human stock."</P>
      <P>"Your people are creative, good quality, low cost -- frankly --
and hard-working. So, based on the quality of its people, there is no
evidence that Australia has any trouble with being a leader in the
Asia-Pacific," he said.</P>
      <P>"Australia should be an Asian center for the information
technology industry -- you have unique strengths. You are the biggest
English-speaking country in Asia, you have a long history of market
democracy, you have a large population of people who are networked
already, you have an excellent education system, and a high-quality
workforce," he commented.</P>
      <P>"Don't concentrate on databases or networks -- you don't have to

    <TEXT>
      <P>The diplomatic warfare between Beijing and
Taipei continues here in Geneva.</P>
      <P>A specialized United Nations agency based in Geneva was forced to
withdraw from jointly hosting a high-level meeting with the
Geneva-based World Trade Organization (WTO) to promote market-access
opportunities for the world's poorest nations after Beijing objected
that the venue would provide Taipei with a de facto political
platform, according to reports of the world trade body on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"The Chinese forced this," noted a high-level US official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.</P>
      <P>About 35 trade ministers representing some of the world's poorest
countries, those with per capita incomes of US$500 or less, are
expected to attend the meeting, scheduled for Oct. 27-28.</P>
      <P>Following months of behind-the-scenes diplomacy in Geneva,
Washington and Beijing, a special session of the WTO General Council
decided that the meeting will now be hosted only by the WTO.</P>
      <P>At the WTO summit last December in Singapore, trade ministers
agreed that the WTO, along with the UN Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD) and other agencies, should organize a meeting to
enhance trade opportunities for the world's poorest countries.</P>
      <P>Mainland China was adamant to the end, however, that
participation by UNCTAD would be seen as a de-facto participation of
Taiwan in a UN meeting, the WTO report said.</P>
      <P>Because Taiwan is an observer at the WTO and mainland China is a
member of the UN, Beijing felt the joint sponsorship would be seen as
mainland China and Taiwan participating in the same conference.</P>
      <P>According to trade diplomats, the insistence by a group of
Central American countries -- including El Salvador and Costa Rica --
that Taiwan and other WTO observer nations not be excluded from the
meeting left the UN agency with no alternative but to step aside, the

    <HEADLINE>ACER ANNOUNCES SINGAPORE  LAUNCH OF CYBER-TV</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Oct.  14  (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Acer, the world's No.6 PC company,
announced on Monday the launch in Singapore of the Acer Cyber-TV
set-top appliance, offering an innovative hybrid of television and
Internet expected to appeal to millions of TV users.</P>
      <P>Shih Chen-jung, chairman and CEO of the Acer Group, made the
announcement in a keynote speech at a press conference in Singapore.</P>
      <P>The Acer Cyber-TV makes use of a standard wireless remote control
to access all its features, just like any other audio or video player
home users are used to. A separate wireless keyboard is used for
typing e-mail and surfing the Internet. These enable users to watch
their usual television programs and simultaneously use the Internet.</P>
      <P>It also comes with a smart card reader that allows the user to
slot in a smart card for online shopping, home banking and access to
secured Internet information services.</P>
      <P>"The Acer Cyber-TV set-top is Acer's jumpstart venture into the
software and service business," Shih said. "We aim to deliver
genuinely affordable and user-friendly products to households. It is
our goal for everyone at home to be empowered with more intelligent
choices of different services and a wider variety of entertainment
and educational programs."</P>
      <P>Central to the TV-centric concept is a specially designed user's
interface by Acer. Once switched on, users will see their usual
television programs, but an icon, codenamed Cyber-TV, will be
positioned at the top left corner of the television screen to provide
access to the Internet channels with just a click on the wireless
remote control.</P>
      <P>The Cyber-TV also allows the user to customize content such as
local weather and traffic conditions, stock market updates and news
taglines for easy, quick updates. This feature is made possible by
using the latest "push" technology, Acer said.</P>
      <P>Acer said that its choice of Singapore as the first launch site
for this innovative product is in recognition of the country's
significant progress in becoming an "intelligent island."</P>
      <P>"Singapore has one of the best multimedia network infrastructures
in the world today," said Lu Hung-yee, president and CEO of Acer
Computer International Ltd.</P>
      <P>The new appliance has been tentatively priced at S$495 and may be
provided free of charge to home subscribers who may pay monthly fees
for the services they use.</P>

the end of June, up 11.95 percent from the year-earlier level,
according to statistics released by the Ministry of Finance (MOF).</P>
      <P>The ministry said that the growth resulted mainly from more

    <HEADLINE>FILIPINO ADMITS MURDER, ROBBERY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  14  (CNA)
(By Debbie Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Filipino worker Jonathan Maala Burgos on
Tuesday admitted to having murdered a Tainan woman and her two
children after robbing her house on Sunday night.</P>
      <P>Burgos, the boyfriend of a runaway Filipina named Babe who once
worked as a maid at Huang Li-yen's home, admitted his guilt after
intense questioning by police. He had denied any involvement in the
murders since his arrest on Monday.</P>
      <P>He confessed that he decided to rob Huang because both his father
and son, who live in the Philippines, are ill, and he needed money
badly.</P>
      <P>Burgos, who had visited Huang's home several times when Babe
worked there, said he knew where Huang kept her money.</P>
      <P>He went to the apartment on Sunday night with the intention of
stealing the money, but killed Huang, 32, and her children after
Huang discovered him and a struggle ensued, Burgos said.</P>
      <P>Police investigating videotapes obtained from a surveillance
camera trained on the victims' apartment building found images of a
man matching Burgo's description who appeared at around the time the
crime was committed.</P>
      <P>Huang was found brutally slain along with her 11-year-old son and
seven-year-old daughter on Monday morning. All three had been stabbed
and slashed to death. Huang's husband, a fruit wholesaler, had spent
Sunday night at another of the family's residences in the city, which
probably saved his life.</P>
      <P>Police became more sure of Burgos' involvement on Monday when
they found a fresh five-centimeter cut on his left hand and Burgos
finally confessed after a pile of cash -- about NT$570,000 -- was
found on Burgos' dormitory balcony. A handbag containing an estimated
NT$700,000 had been stolen from the house.</P>
      <P>Burgos told the police that he threw the murder weapon into a
roadside garbage dump, burnt his bloodstained clothes outside his
dormitory and threw the handbag into a ditch.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, police also found Babe on Tuesday. Although she was
found to have been uninvolved in the crime, police said she will be
repatriated because she is staying illegally in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>About one-tenth of the foreign laborers in Taiwan are living here
illegally, most of them having absconded from their original
employers. Thousands of Filipinos who come to Taiwan on legal work
contracts flee their legal jobs to avoid being sent home when labor
contracts expire after two or three years.</P>

      <P>Negotiators from Taiwan and the United
States will meet in Taipei on Wednesday for a 16th round of talks on
the terms of Taiwan's bid to enter the World Trade Organization
(WTO), sources from the Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) reported on
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The two sides, to be headed by BOFT Director General Chen
Ruey-long and David Burns, the US Trade Representative Office's
director for Asia-Pacific affairs, will tackle issues including
Taiwan's medical pricing system, infringement of commercial patents,
Taiwan's WTO protocol and tariff cuts, BOFT officials said.</P>
      <P>During the week-long meeting, the two sides will also discuss
Taiwan's government procurement systems, as well as the opening of
local agricultural, insurance, stock brokerage, telecommunications
and service markets.</P>
      <P>BOFT officials also revealed that the US side will ask Taiwan to
impose import tariffs on US-made automobiles on an energy-consumption
basis, rather than on an engine capacity basis, adding that this
might present problems for Taiwan, since imposing auto tariffs
according to engine capacity has long been standard international
practice.</P>
      <P>Some more sensitive issues still outstanding, such as Taiwan
imports of US pork, cigarettes and alcoholic products, will not be
included in this round of talks, they noted.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has completed talks with 21 of the 26 WTO member-states

      <P>Vice Premier and Foreign Affairs Minister
John Chang said on Tuesday that his ministry is studying the
feasibility of setting up a representative office in Iceland and of
allowing Iceland to open its own representative office here.</P>
      <P>Chang made the announcement at the Legislative Yuan while
answering questions on the government's position on mainland China's
continuing attempts to stifle the Republic of China's presence in the
international community.</P>
      <P>The questions were prompted by the cancellation of Vice President
Lien Chan's scheduled visit to Spain during his just-concluded
European trip as a result of Beijing's boycott.</P>
      <P>Lien, accompanied by his wife and Senior Presidential Advisor Hsu
Li-teh, made an unofficial tour of Iceland on Oct. 5-10, followed by
a two-day visit to Austria. He returned home on Monday, canceling his
visit to Spain at the request of the Spanish government.</P>
      <P>Chang told legislators that the diplomatic setback will not
discourage his ministry from developing relations with other nations,
pointing out that as a sovereign state, the ROC has the right, the
most basic right, to expand its space in the international community.</P>
      <P>The foreign minister stressed that the ROC's efforts to develop
foreign links is not aimed at provoking mainland China. On the
contrary, he said, the ROC hopes to maintain stable cross-strait
relations. The problem, he added, is that Beijing simply cannot grasp
the fact that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are now divided and

      <P>Vice Economic Affairs Minister Chang
Chang-pang is scheduled to depart for Mexico City on Saturday at the
head of a government delegation to attend the ninth Joint Meeting
between the Mexican and Taiwan Business Councils.</P>
      <P>During the five-day meeting, Chang will familiarize himself with
the business and investment climate in Mexico, and meet with Taiwan
investors to know better their business development and the problems
they have encountered there.</P>
      <P>Mexico is Taiwan's major export market in Latin America and its
third largest trading partner in that region. Taiwan exported US$470
million worth of merchandise to Mexico in 1996, up 20 percent over
the 1995 level, while importing US$210 million worth of Mexican
products, down 3 percent from the year-earlier level.</P>
      <P>As of June this year, about 50 Taiwan businesses have relocated
their operations to Mexico, mainly in the two-way trade and
manufacturing sectors, according to tallies from the Ministry of
Economic Affairs (MOEA).</P>
      <P>Business and investment relations between Taiwan and Mexico have
been strengthened significantly since the MOEA established an
economic affairs section under the Taipei Economic and Cultural
Office in Mexico in June last year, MOEA officials said.</P>
      <P>The Mexican government has also often clearly shown its support
for Taiwan's bid to join the World Trade Organization, the officials
noted.</P>
      <P>Quoting an estimate released by the Pacific Economic Cooperation
Council, MOEA officials said Mexico's economy is expected to grow 5
percent in 1997 and an even higher 5.5 percent in 1998.</P>
      <P>Since the Mexican government embarked on a five-year economic
revitalization plan in March 1995 to bolster the country's economy
and stabilize the currency, the Latin American country has sustained
economic growth of 5 percent annually, with this level expected to
continue through 2000, the officials pointed out.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP CHAIRMAN CALLS FOR END TO CROSS-STRAIT HOSTILITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Paris,  Oct. 14 (CNA)
(By M.J. Tzou and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The chairman of Taiwan's largest opposition
party said here on Tuesday that his party has deliberately toned
down its pro-Taiwan independence advocacy in an attempt to maintain
peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and facilitate an early end
to cross-strait hostility.</P>
      <P>"However, this does not mean that the Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) has forsaken its goal of creating an independent Taiwan
republic," DPP Chairman Hsu Hsin-liang said in a keynote speech to a
seminar on Taiwan-mainland Chinese relations sponsored by the
Paris-based International Relations Research Institute.</P>
      <P>Hsu said the DPP has played a critical role in Taiwan's
democratization, adding that the party, with a view to ensuring
regional stability, now focuses on helping reinforce Taiwan's
strength and international status rather than on promoting the
independence movement.</P>
      <P>On cross-strait relations, Hsu said, the DPP has consistently
advocated that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait end their hostility
and cultivate peaceful, friendly ties.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the so-called "one China" policy has hindered
Taiwan's bid to walk out into the international community, Hsu said
Taiwan should get rid of this historical burden and present itself
as a prosperous, vibrant new democracy with an independent,
sovereign status to win more international recognition.</P>
      <P>Hsu said his current European tour is part of the DPP's efforts
to expand Taiwan's diplomatic frontiers through nurturing
friendly ties with major political parties in other countries.</P>
      <P>Hsu proudly said Taiwan has managed to outpace Singapore in
democratic development mainly because of the existence of a strong
opposition force on the island since the martial law era. He
stressed that the DPP has played a positive role in pressing the
ruling Kuomintang to undertake political reforms.</P>
      <P>"The time is gradually ripe for the DPP to gain ruling power,"
Hsu said, adding that the party has won increasing popular support
with its public opinion-oriented political platform, including
upgrading Taiwan's international status and establishing a sound
social welfare service system.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, DPP Legislator Parris Chang said
Taiwan's future should be determined by the people of Taiwan in
accordance with the underlying democratic principle of "popular
sovereignty," adding that Taiwan's destiny should neither be
determined by Beijing nor Washington.</P>
      <P>Chang, an international affairs expert, said that Taiwan, with
its achievements in economic development and political
democratization, should increase contacts with the international
community and break its Beijing-imposed diplomatic isolation.</P>
      <P>Touching on cross-strait relations, Chang said the DPP is willing
to conduct peaceful negotiations and dialogue with Beijing based on
the principle of equality and reciprocity in order to promote
peaceful co-existence and co-prosperity.</P>
      <P>Chang urged Beijing to give up its hegemonic mentality and not to
treat Taiwan as another Hong Kong because Taiwan is an independent
sovereign state, not a colony.</P>
      <P>More than 50 Chinese and French academics attended the seminar
moderated by professor Francoise Mengin, a Taiwan affairs expert.</P>
      <P>Hsu, heading a high-level DPP delegation, arrived in Paris on
Monday after attending a conference in Berlin of top leaders from
democratic parties in major countries around the world.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BOTH SIDES OF TAIWAN STRAIT URGED TO STEP UP DIALOGUE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  Oct.  14  (CNA)
(By K.C. Huang and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lin Chung-ping, vice chairman of the
cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) of the Republic of
China, said here Tuesday that both sides of the Taiwan Strait should
step up dialogue for peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and
Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Lin said both sides of the Taiwan Strait should also face the
fact of "separate rule."</P>
      <P>Lin made the remarks in an address on the latest developments in
cross-strait relations at a seminar at Columbia University.</P>
      <P>Lin said that since Beijing lobbed missiles in waters near Taiwan
in the run-up to the ROC presidential election in March 1996, it has
adjusted its policy toward the island.</P>
      <P>Beijing has tried every means to isolate Taiwan diplomatically,
used the pretext of "one China" to stifle Taiwan's efforts to gain a
greater profile in the international community, tried to weaken the
island's economy by luring more Taiwan investment across the strait,
stepped up contacts with Taiwan, modernized its army and sent out
implicit signals to put psychological pressure on people on the
island, he said.</P>
      <P>Lin said the call Beijing has made since ROC President Lee
Teng-hui's four-nation Latin American tour last month for both sides
to prepare for political dialogue might be due to mainland Chinese
President Jiang Zemin wanting to put on a peace-loving facade before
his trip to the United States later this month.</P>
      <P>Other reasons for the call, Lin said, could be that Beijing has
finally realized that drastic actions to isolate Taipei would
backfire and that Jiang wants to achieve something in cross-strait
relations during his five-year term to further solidify his
position.</P>
      <P>Citing recent opinion polls on Taiwan residents' attitude toward
cross-strait relations, Lin noted 35 percent of those polled said
that both sides of the Taiwan Strait should maintain the status quo
and decide the future later, with 22 percent favoring both sides
maintaining the status quo permanently.</P>
      <P>Those who favored the status quo toward future unification and
those who favored it toward future independence accounted for 14
percent and 11 percent respectively. Those who wanted speedy
unification and speedy independence accounted for 5 percent and 10
percent respectively. The remainder of those polled had no opinion,
he added.</P>
      <P>He said that 44 percent of those polled called the ROC's
diplomatic relations with other countries and cross-strait exchanges
equally important. Those who said they believe that developing
diplomatic relations is more important accounted for 31 percent,
higher than the 23 percent who said the reverse.</P>
      <P>The ROC is happy to see mainland China continuing to achieve
stable development through its reforms, he stressed.</P>
      <P>Lin left Taiwan for the United States on Oct. 9. Before visiting
New York, he attended a seminar in Washington, D.C. on Saturday. He
will speak on cross-strait relations at the New England School of Law
in Boston on Friday.</P>
      <P>Lin will return to Taiwan Oct. 19.</P>

(By Debbie Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With Beijing still unwilling to accept the
fact that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are two political
entities under separate ruling systems, it would be difficult and
even "meaningless" to talk about the structure of a reunified China,
said Premier Vincent Siew on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>As long as Beijing continues to refuse to accept any ideas from
Taipei that go contrary to its notions, talking about whether Taiwan
and mainland China would reunify under a "federal" or "commonwealth"
formula just don't make sense, Siew said.</P>
      <P>"The crux of the matter is Beijing's ideology," he added.</P>
      <P>Fielding a question by Legislator Hung Hsing-jung (KMT-Changhua)
at a Legislative Yuan plenary session, Siew said the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait will reunify naturally and peacefully once the standard
of living on the Chinese mainland is significantly improved.</P>
      <P>Noting that the late mainland Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping once
said it would probably take several hundred years for Taiwan and
mainland China to reunify, Siew said once income levels and the ways
of life on the two sides become close, reunification would be an easy
matter. "Where water flows, a channel is formed," the premier said,
quoting an ancient Chinese proverb.</P>
      <P>To reach a standard of living like Taiwan enjoys, he added,
mainland China will have to do more than it has already.</P>

      <P>The Kaohsiung-based China Shipbuilding
Corp. (CSBC) said on Wednesday it has not negotiated any acquisition
or merger bids with individual local business groups.</P>
      <P>The company was commenting on a newspaper report that the
Evergreen Group, which operates the world's largest container
shipping fleet, intends to buy into the state-owned shipbuilding
firm.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, the Formosa Plastics Group, Taiwan's largest
private conglomerate, was also said to be interested in acquiring the
CSBC.</P>
      <P>"All such reports are not true," a CSBC spokesman said, adding
that the company would not consider any acquisition or merger bid at
present.</P>
      <P>He noted that the Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and
Development has demanded that the CSBC complete its privatization by
2001 in accordance with a resolution reached at last year's National
Development Conference.</P>
      <P>To meet that deadline, the spokesman said, the CSBC is actively
expanding its business and improving its financial status to
facilitate privatization.</P>
      <P>"We'll promote privatization by trading our stock on the Taiwan
Stock Exchange," the spokesman said, adding that the CSBC labor union
has agreed to the proposal.</P>
      <P>The spokesman further said the company will re-evaluate its
land assets and plans to trim its capital in order to facilitate its
application for listing on the Taiwan Stock Exchange. The CSBC
currently has total assets of more than NT$35.6 billion (US$1.25
billion).</P>
      <P>In addition to building commercial vessels, the CSBC is also

    <HEADLINE>THINK-TANK OUTLINES FACTORS INFLUENCING ECONOMY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  15  (CNA)
(By Debbie Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Southeast Asia's currency crisis, the
development of cross-strait trade relations, and rising risks of
Taiwan's high-technology industries are three major factors that may
exert impact on the island's economic growth over the next year, a
private economic think-tank said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Specialists at the Chung-hua Institute for Economic Research
(CIER) said that in the short term, the New Taiwan dollar will
maintain its fairly stable level of around NT$28.5 to the US dollar
as a result of Taiwan's stable economic growth, sufficient foreign
exchange reserves and protective manipulation of the currency market
by the Central Bank of China.</P>
      <P>However, they said, it is hard to say whether the NT dollar will
maintain its strength in the long term, since there exist several
factors that may trigger a currency decline.</P>
      <P>These factors include mainland China's eventual depreciation of
its renminbi as a result of efforts to sharpen its competitiveness
against its Southeast Asian rivals on the world market, and the
further depreciation of the Southeast Asian currencies as a result of
the failure of a rescue plan to be implemented by the International
Monetary Fund, CIER experts said.</P>
      <P>If the renminbi depreciates, the NT dollar will have little
choice but to follow suit, due to Taiwan's ever-increasing reliance
on the mainland market, they pointed out.</P>
      <P>With regard to cross-strait trade relations, the experts foresee
a brighter future, on the grounds that both Taiwan and the mainland
are preparing to enter the World Trade Organization, mainland China
needs investment from Taiwan and Taiwan needs mainland China's vast
markets. There is also high expectations by the international
community of a thaw in ties across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the CIER experts pointed out that risk factor in the
island's high-technology industry, including computer and
semiconductor manufacturing, are growing as a result of the short
evolution cycle of the industry and the increasing number of
industrial disputes in foreign markets.</P>
      <P>Rather than putting all Taiwan's eggs in one basket, the experts
suggested that the island should not rely too much on the
high-technology industry alone, but should help develop or upgrade
other, more traditional industries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHIAO'S COMMENTS ON MAINLAND CHINA'S DESIRE TO RESUME NEGOTIATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 15 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Chairman of Taiwan's Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) Chiao Jen-ho observed on Tuesday that an article to
be published in "Cross Strait Relations," a monthly magazine
published by mainland China's Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Straits (ARATS) is significant. However, he added that the
article, entitled "Starting Early Political Negotiations to Promote
the Development of Cross-Strait Relations" would be more pertinent
and a better indication of Beijing's sincerity if its sentiments were
disclosed in a direct statement to the SEF by ARATS.</P>
      <P>Since the 15th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party,
Beijing has urged early political cross-strait negotiations through
various unofficial channels such as the magazine.</P>
      <P>At a question-and-answer session with the press, Chiao stressed
that with respect to mainland China's "one-China" prerequisite for
negotiations, the ROC's Guidelines for National Unification contain a
clear explanation on Taiwan's position on the issue, and that mutual
understanding of the issue had been previously reached with Beijing.
If Beijing is willing to act in line with that mutual understanding,
the "one-China" issue presents no barriers, Chiao pointed out.</P>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew and Chang King-yuh, Chairman of the ROC's
cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), have said repeatedly
that Taipei does not rule out the possibility of political
negotiations and that it is SEF's consistent desire to resume talks
on policy dialogue, according to Chiao.</P>
      <P>The MAC is the government organization charged with charting
mainland policy in the absence of official diplomatic ties.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S ECONOMY SHOWING SIGNS OF RECOVERY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei  Oct.  15  (CNA)
(By Lawrence Chu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economy is showing signs of
entering a recovery phase after months of sluggishness, a major
private economic think-tank said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In a regularly issued report predicting Taiwan's economic
performance over the last quarter of 1997, the Chung-Hwa Institute
for Economic Research (CIER) said the island has experienced steady
economic growth throughout the year.</P>
      <P>The finance sector has experienced the most ups and downs over
the first half of 1997, averaging 6.6 percent economic growth during
the period, the institute said.</P>
      <P>One of the most remarkable achievements Taiwan's economy has seen
over the past year has been in the production value,which
registered the highest growth since 1991.</P>
      <P>Available data indicates that Taiwan's economy is already well
into a recovery phase and the CIER predicted that annual production
value growth rates for the third and fourth quarters of 1997 will be
6.35 percent and 6.30 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>If achieved, the figure will place Taiwan's average annual
production value growth rate for all of 1997 at 6.45 percent, the
CIER said, adding that Taiwan's ongoing economic recovery was mostly
the product of a recent surge in domestic demand for goods and
services.</P>
      <P>As consuming increases amid an improving economic atmosphere,
share prices have been gradually rising and local residents have
become increasingly concerned about their quality of life.</P>
      <P>Combined with the economic stimuli expected in connection with
the upcoming November 29 islandwide elections for county chiefs and
mayors, overall economic growth could reach as high as 7.19 percent
for the entire year, a full percentage point ahead of last year's
tally, the CIER forecast.</P>
      <P>In its previous reports this year, the institute predicted that
the economy would grow by 6.83 percent in the first quarter, while
the actual figure turned out to be 6.86 percent.</P>
      <P>A 5.81 percent prediction for the second quarter of 1997 was met
with a 6.34 percent result, while 6.4 percent prediction for the
third quarter ended up close to the 6.35 percent actually recorded.</P>
      <P>The fourth quarter growth estimate, at 6.3 percent, was revised
from an earlier 6.26 percent prediction.</P>
      <P>The think-tank also predicted that economic growth would top 6.61
percent for 1998, slightly higher than its earlier 6.5 percent
prediction.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia's CSR Corp., a leading producer

result of a sharp drop in infrastructure spending in Taiwan and
fundamental changes in the Indonesian and mainland China plasterboard

    <HEADLINE>JUDGE AWARDS NT$38 MILLION TO RESIDENTS OF RADIOACTIVE BUILDING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 15 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei district court has ruled that the
Atomic Energy Council (AEC) under the Executive Yuan should pay a
total of more than NT$38 million (US$1.33 million) to 48 residents of
a radioactively contaminated building.</P>
      <P>This is the first case where residents of buildings built with
radioactive steel bars have been successful in gaining government
compensation. Many similar cases are still pending.</P>
      <P>According to the ruling Tuesday, the AEC must not only pay the
plaintiffs over NT$38 million but also shoulder 35 percent of their
legal fees.</P>
      <P>Wang Yu-lin, one of the 57 plaintiffs who filed the class action
suit, said Wednesday that although he thought the award was too
small, he was happy to see social justice upheld at last.</P>
      <P>But another resident, who requested anonymity, said the
compensation would not make up for the damage to the health of those
who still have to live in the building. She also urged the government
to continue to give the residents annual physicals.</P>
      <P>AEC Chairman Hu Ching-piao said he would consult with the
council's lawyer before deciding whether or not to appeal the
decision.</P>
      <P>In the lawsuit filed with the district court, Wang and the other
plaintiffs claimed that the AEC knew before 1985 that the building
had an abnormally high level of radioactivity, but that the council
had not acted to investigate this further, nor had it tried to fully
inform the residents or improve the situation.</P>
      <P>The people in the building did not learn they were being exposed
to high levels of radiation until seven years later in Aug. 1992,
when the media exposed the matter.</P>
      <P>The plaintiffs had asked for NT$112.31 million (US$3.91 million)
to compensate them for physical and mental suffering, as well as for
the decreased value of their property.</P>
      <P>But Judge Chan Wen-hsing, who presided over the case, ruled that
nine out of the 57 plaintiffs could not demonstrate that they
continued to live in the building for a long period after 1985, and
that the remaining 48 could not fully prove all of the other losses,
though they had spent money on medical expenses and additional
medical insurance.</P>
      <P>Chan said that she awarded the 48 plaintiffs nearly NT$38.46
million to compensate them for damage to their health, taking into
consideration their social status, economic situation and other
factors. Individual awards ranged between NT$200,000 (US$7,018) and
NT$2 million (US$70,175).</P>
      <P>Chan declined to award damages based on lowered property value,
saying it was the builders that had used the radioactive steel bars
and that the AEC had no universal obligation to monitor the
radioactivity of steel bars for buildings before 1984.</P>

    <HEADLINE>M'LAND CHINA DOESN'T HAVE MAJOR OFFENSIVE CAPABILITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>London,  Oct.  14 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China continues to modernize its
strategic and major conventional weapon systems but does not have the
capability to project major conventional forces beyond its territory
now or in the near future, according to the International Institute
for Strategic Studies (IISS).</P>
      <P>The London-based IISS said Tuesday in its "The Military Balance
1997/98" report that mainland China's main force elements, in terms
of technology, remain well behind those of other major powers. It
will take most of the next decade for mainland China to reach the
technological level of, for example, the major NATO powers.</P>
      <P>The annual report added that mainland China's overall military
capability has changed little since 1996 and at present it does not
have the resources to project a major conventional force beyond its
territory.</P>
      <P>Instead, Beijing appears to give priority to improving strategic
forces, particularly missiles, as a credible deterrent, and to
enhancing the mobility and capability of its military to deal with
border threats and major internal security problems.</P>
      <P>On July 1, mainland China received Hong Kong from Britain with no
unexpected security problems. Relations with Taiwan, despite some
major exercises by the navies of both mainland China and Taiwan in
June 1997, remain relatively calm as far as military activities are
concerned, the IISS noted.</P>
      <P>The uncertainties in the international security environment since
the end of the Cold War are now being reflected in arms-sale trends,
said the institute.</P>
      <P>After years of decline since 1987, an upward movement in the
international arms trade is now clear, it said.</P>
      <P>The top three arms suppliers remain the United States, Britain
and France, which all recorded large increases in defense exports in
1996.</P>
      <P>Eight states imported more than US$1 billion apiece in defense
equipment in 1996: Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Japan, Britain, mainland
China, Taiwan, South Korea and Kuwait.</P>
      <P>In Southeast Asia, the major arms importers in 1996 were once
again Indonesia and Thailand (at US$700 million each), Singapore
(US$400 million) and Malaysia (US$350 million).</P>
      <P>The IISS noted that mainland China's potential threat to regional
security is one of the main reasons behind Southeast Asian countries'
increased defense spending.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EAST ASIAN NATIONS WILL SHOW ROBUST GROWTH: GOH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Oct.  15 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong
said in Hong Kong on Tuesday that he is confident that East Asian
countries will grow robustly in the medium and long term, despite the
recent economic hiccups.</P>
      <P>Addressing the East Asia Economic Summit held in Hong Kong, Goh
pointed out that the turmoil that has hit ASEAN (Association of
Southeast Asian Nations) currencies is a temporary, though painful,
setback and could serve as a "wake-up call" to East Asian countries
to take the tough measures needed to strengthen their economies.</P>
      <P>"Those who espouse the theory that East Asia's rapid growth was
largely a matter of perspiration rather than inspiration feel
vindicated," he noted. "They feel that Asian economic growth will
slow down markedly. Some have even pronounced the end of the Asian
miracle.</P>
      <P>"Such a view is too pessimistic. Just as the haze which blankets
the region will clear, the miasma of uncertainty which has affected
sentiment in Asia will, after a while, evaporate," he told
businessmen, academics and politicians at the conference organized by
the Geneva-based World Economic Forum.</P>
      <P>If the current turmoil is viewed as a "wake-up call" to the
region to get its economic house in order, he asserted, "we can turn
the sentiment around, by strengthening our economic fundamentals."</P>
      <P>Citing figures to back his upbeat assessment of the region's
outlook, Goh pointed out that the World Bank was also bullish about
the region's future, projecting in a report last month that East Asia
will grow by an average of 7.6 percent a year over the next decade.</P>
      <P>On rising labor costs, Goh noted that wages in the newly
industrialized countries had grown by 12 percent a year since 1990,
compared with 3 percent in the United States and 9 percent in France
and Germany.</P>
      <P>Unless labor productivity in East Asia grows more rapidly than
elsewhere, countries in the region risk losing their competitive
edge, he cautioned.</P>
      <P>East Asian governments will also have to raise their investment
in higher education to train more technicians and graduates needed in
an increasingly skills and knowledge-driven economy, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO MAJOR CHANGE IN BASIC POLICY TOWARD OUTER MONGOLIA: CHANG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  15  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Premier and Minister of Foreign
Affairs John Chang said on Wednesday that there will be no major
changes in the Republic of China's basic policy toward Outer
Mongolia.</P>
      <P>Chang was commenting on reports that the ROC government will look
upon Outer Mongolia as a "special region" other than mainland China.</P>
      <P>The ROC has traditionally regarded Outer Mongolia as part of its
territory even though Outer Mongolia declared independence from China
in 1921 and is now a United Nations member.</P>
      <P>"We'll uphold this policy," Chang said, adding that the
government does not oppose developing substantive ties with Outer
Mongolia and is willing to assist it in economic development, but
political relations between the two sides will not see any major
changes at the moment.</P>
      <P>Kao Koong-lian, chairman of the Cabinet-level Mongolian and
Tibetan Affairs Commission (MTAC), suggested at a weekly meeting of
the ruling Kuomintang's Central Standing Committee that the
government treat Outer Mongolia as a "special region" other than the
Chinese mainland and lift all unnecessary restrictions on bilateral
trade and economic exchanges.</P>
      <P>Noting that Outer Mongolia is not controlled by communist China
and does not harbor any hostility toward Taiwan, Kao said the
government should amend the current regulations governing investment
and technological cooperation across the Taiwan Strait and exclude
Outer Mongolia from the provision of those regulations.</P>
      <P>Kao said Taiwan should develop direct trade and economic ties
with Outer Mongolia, open the local market to all Mongolian products
and exempt Mongolia-bound investments from same restrictions imposed
on mainland China-bound investments.</P>
      <P>Kao said he is convinced that commercial, tourism and cultural
exchanges between Taiwan and Outer Mongolia will greatly increase by
removing those restrictions.</P>
      <P>Kao, who had been a vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council
before assuming his current post in September, further said the Dalai
Lama's visit to Taiwan in March this year has helped boost the
Tibetan spiritual leader's understanding of Taiwan's efforts on
behalf of Tibetan people on the island.</P>
      <P>"The visit has also helped reduce misunderstandings by the
Tibetan government-in-exile in the northern Indian city of Dharmsala
on the ROC's Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission," Kao added.</P>
      <P>After listening to Kao's report, President Lee Teng-hui, who
concurrently serves as KMT chairman, ordered all relevant government
agencies to study the feasibility of removing unnecessary
restrictions on trade and civilian exchanges with Outer Mongolia.</P>
      <P>Lee also urged the MTAC to intensify contacts with exiled
Tibetans in Nepal and India and assist young Tibetans in receiving
education and finding suitable jobs.</P>

    <DATELINE>Singapore, Oct. 15 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore will play a catalytic bridging
role in building networks for growth between Asia, Europe and the
Americas, Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said in Hong Kong
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the World Economic Forum Singapore Networking Lunch,
he pointed out that the theme of this year's East Asia Economic
Summit, which closed in Hong Kong on Wednesday, on how to strengthen
the links between Europe, Asia and the Americas -- the three engines
of global economic growth -- is most timely and relevant.</P>
      <P>Singapore will play a catalytic bridging role in this respect, he
said, through three kinds of networks: businesses, personnel, and
knowledge and information.</P>
      <P>At present, there are some 5,000 multinational companies located
in Singapore, he said. About half of them have regional operations
using Singapore as their base, while 850 manufacture for world
markets.</P>
      <P>There are also some 220 banks located in Singapore. And
Singapore's foreign exchange market ranks as the fourth largest in
the world.</P>
      <P>"We are a major telecommunication and transportation hub," Goh
said. All these offer a wealth of business links and partners, he
added.</P>
      <P>In addition, Singapore invested S$46 billion abroad in 1995 and
operated eight major industrial parks in Indonesia, mainland China,
Vietnam and India.</P>
      <P>Singapore now ranks as the largest foreign investor in Malaysia
and Vietnam, No. 3 in Indonesia, No. 4 in Thailand, and No. 6 in
China, and has also significant investments in the Philippines and
Myanmar.</P>
      <P>"With all these investments at home and abroad, Singapore can be
a global hub for manufacturing, services and finance," Goh said,
adding that Singapore can provide the network of business especially
for Southeast Asia and China.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that one major factor behind Singapore's sustained
economic growth is its huge investment in people and talent.
Singapore has attracted talent from all over the world, and will be
even more active in attracting top-notch personnel.</P>
      <P>In today's high technology and information age, human talent,
intellectual capital and the ability to add value and disseminate
knowledge are keys to Singapore's success, he asserted.</P>
      <P>The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, for example,
have set up their regional training centers in Singapore.</P>
      <P>Goh said he was keen to see Singapore play the role of an
interregional training center, where European and American managers
can be trained before their assignment in Asia. Asian managers and
engineers in turn can be trained in Singapore before they proceed to

    <HEADLINE>M'LAND CHINA MOVING DOWN PATH OF DISINTEGRATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct.  15  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China is expected to move
towards the path of disintegration as a result of a series of
internal trade wars among the provinces which the central government
in Beijing is powerless to end, according to a leading China expert
in Australia.</P>
      <P>Writing on the opinion page of the Australian Financial Review on
Wednesday, Dr. Robert Leeson, senior lecturer of the Economics
Department of the Murdoch University in Perth, Australia, said
Western commentators once misread the forces that were loosed by
post-communist "reconstruction" in the old Soviet empire.</P>
      <P>"It appears that a similar miscalculation is now being made about
China," he said.</P>
      <P>"As China opened up to international trade, by 1981 its ratio of
trade to GDP (gross domestic product) exceeded that of Japan (14
percent); by 1985 that of the United States (19 percent); and by 1994
that of the United Kingdom (41 percent). South Korea seems next on
the list to be overtaken," he said.</P>
      <P>"But this `coming to market' has been accompanied by a series of
internal trade wars, with large-scale tariff and non-tariff barriers
to inter-regional trade," he said.</P>
      <P>"There has been no `retreat from planning' in China; only the
devolution of the planning process from the center to the regions.
The strengthening of international trading ties has been accompanied
by a conscious attempt by the provinces to strengthen their own local
economic power by weakening inter-regional trading relations," he
said.</P>
      <P>He claimed mainland China's Ministry of Civil Affairs is now
trying to stem on-going disputes over the "ownership" of natural
resources by delineating all disputed regional and provincial
boundaries.</P>
      <P>"At the same time, local protectionism is rampant; the government
of Zhejiang province has restricted the sale of silk cocoons to other
parts of China; Guizhou province has banned the import of
televisions, refrigerators and bicycles from other parts of China;
Hunan and Guangxi are reported to be patrolling their borders to
prevent inter-regional `smuggling,'" he said.</P>
      <P>"By controlling inter-regional trade, they can act as a monopoly
buyer of raw materials (at controlled prices) and benefit from the
foreign exchange earned," he said.</P>
      <P>"Beijing appears powerless to prevent this massive growth of
provincial economic power; indeed some of its policies have
unintentionally fostered it," he said.</P>
      <P>"In the reform era, central political authority has progressively
dissolved, leaving each province to become increasingly
self-sufficient. The lessons of the 1930s is that this type of
economic autarchy is often a prelude to conflict. But the territory
we call China has not always been a single unified country or
empire," he said.</P>
      <P>"Before the communist take-over, it was often a collection of
feuding provinces, dominated by warlords," he said.</P>
      <P>"Each province is again acquiring an independent economic
structure and a motive and a power to resist the center. The People's
Liberation Army is also to a large extent economically
self-sufficient," Leeson said.</P>
      <P>"The way to do business in China is to ingratiate oneself with
the local elite who operate independently from Beijing," Leeson said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US TO INTENSIFY PORT WAR WITH JAPAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  Oct.  15  (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The US Federal Maritime Commission is
preparing to escalate a port war with Japan by compiling a new list
of companies to be hit with tougher sanctions, according to reports
from the Geneva-based World Trade Organization (WTO) Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The FMC imposed fees on Japanese shipping lines as of Sept. 4,
but these sanctions have failed to change Japanese port practices.</P>
      <P>The new list is aimed at US-based companies that have ties to the
Japan Harbor Transportation Association, the agency accused of
stifling international competition at Japanese ports.</P>
      <P>The FMC is also considering raising existing fees of US$100,000
every time a vessel from one of the companies calls at a US port. The
first payments are due on Oct. 15.</P>
      <P>Three of the companies hit by September's sanctions challenged
the FMC's authority to impose fees. Mitsui OSK Lines, Kawasaki Kisen
Kaisha and Nippon Yasen Kaisha claimed the duties would impede their
competitiveness. They failed to convince the US Court of Appeals that
they would suffer long-term damage although they estimate the costs
to be US$17 million in the first year.</P>
      <P>The Japanese government has filed an appeal with the FMC asking
that any fees be placed in escrow. The FMC has not yet put forward an
official request for increased or expanded sanctions, but it is
"looking for ways to exert more pressure on the Japanese," according
to the WTO report.</P>
      <P>The FMC sanctions followed months of negotiations which failed to
resolve differences over how to reform practices at Japanese ports,
which foreign shipping companies claim are inefficient and costly.</P>
      <P>The US complaint concerns stevedoring practices at Japanese ports
which foreign shipowners claim keep prices high and prevent them from
raising efficiency.</P>
      <P>In particular, shipping companies have complained about a
requirement that all changes to vessel schedules be made through the
Japanese Harbor Transportation Association, which represents
cargo-handling companies.</P>
      <P>The European Union has also lodged a complaint with the WTO over
Japan's harbor practices and has held talks on the matter.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SHIPPING MAGNATE'S CALL RECEIVES MUTED RESPONSE FROM GOV'T.</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  15  (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A call made by shipping tycoon Chang
Yung-fa in a newspaper interview on Wednesday for Taiwan to open
direct links with mainland China received a muted response from
government officials, although some business moguls voiced their
support.</P>
      <P>Chang, chairman of the Evergreen Group, which runs the world's
largest container fleet, told the China Times that the government
should review its "no haste, be patient" economic policy toward the
mainland and lift its bans on direct cross-strait postal, trade and
transportation links at an early date.</P>
      <P>Taipei's rigid ban on the direct links with the mainland in those
three areas has cost local enterprises countless business
opportunities and created difficulties for the people, Chang said in
an interview published in Wednesday's edition of the Chinese-language
daily. He added that he does not believe the direct contacts will
endanger national security.</P>
      <P>Chang King-yuh, chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council, the nation's top policymaking body for mainland policy, said
the time is not ripe for Taiwan to open direct postal, commercial,
shipping and aviation exchanges with the mainland. The charting of
government policy toward the mainland must take into account matters
concerning the nation's security, he stressed.</P>
      <P>Kuo Chen-fu, chairman of the semi-official Straits Exchange
Foundation, said that "mutual respect" is the key factor in improving
cross-strait relations. Until the mainland authorities agree to treat
Taiwan as a political entity of equal status, there can be no talk of
removing the ban on direct links, said Koo, who is Taipei's top
negotiator with Beijing in the absence of official contacts.</P>
      <P>Kuo said that prior to the opening of direct links, the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait must hold talks to tackle a range of unresolved
technical issues. He once again urged the mainland to reopen
semi-official talks with Taiwan, which were unilaterally suspended by
the mainland in protest at President Lee Teng-hui's visit to the
United States in June 1995.</P>
      <P>P.K. Chiang, chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development, said that the economic policy toward mainland should be
in accordance with the National Unification Guidelines. The offshore
transshipment center which began operations earlier this year and
several special economic zones currently in the planning stages are
designed to facilitate cross-strait trade exchanges, Chiang added.</P>
      <P>Liu Tai-ying, chairman of ruling Kuomintang's Business Management
Committee, said that so long as the mainland authorities continue to
regard the Republic of China as a local administration, the opening
of direct links will harm Taiwan's businessmen's interests and also
endanger the island's security.</P>
      <P>Wang You-theng, chairman of the General Chamber of Commerce of
the ROC, said that he supports the government's current policy toward
the mainland. Commenting on Chang Yung-fa's remarks that he would be
willing to go to the mainland as a "secret envoy" to help break the
cross-strait economic and political deadlock, Wang said that it was
wishful thinking on the shipping magnate's part.</P>
      <P>Chang Yung-fa revealed in the interview that he visited Beijing
two weeks ago but declined to confirm whether he met with mainland
Chinese President Jiang Zemin.</P>
      <P>Kao Chin-yen, chairman of the Chinese National Federation of
Industries, hailed Chang's call for direct contacts, saying that "the
sooner the three links can be realized, the better." Continued delays
will be detrimental to the interests of Taiwan businessmen, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA TO SUPPORT FULL AUTONOMY FOR HONG KONG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct.  15  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia will continue to support the
full exercise of the autonomous status in Hong Kong because it will
contribute to regional prosperity and security in the Asia-Pacific
region, Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said on
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In a speech to the Asia Society and the Australian Chamber of
Commerce in Hong Kong, Downer said Hong Kong's remarkable economic
development and emergence as a regional force in its own right would
not have been possible without mainland China's economic reforms.</P>
      <P>But, just as important, if not more so, he said, is
mainland China's promise that its capitalist economy, free press, rule
of law and evolving democratic institutions will be protected under a
high degree of autonomy.</P>
      <P>"It is this which will allow Hong Kong to continue to play a role
in China -- and the wider region's -- economic development. It is
this which will also contribute to regional prosperity and security,"
Downer said.</P>
      <P>He said that the Asia-Pacific's quality of life depends on much
more than sustained prosperity and enhanced security, and that Hong
Kong is a gateway to substantial trade and investment in
mainland China and a springboard for new business partnerships in
Asia.</P>
      <P>Downer said: "Australia's basic approach to Hong Kong's historic
transition has been and will continue to be to support the full
exercise by Hong Kong of the autonomy it has been promised by China
in areas other than foreign affairs and defense.</P>
      <P>"This is the most realistic and pragmatic way of advancing
Australia's substantial economic stake in Hong Kong's future as an
important economic regional player," he said.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong is a major trading partner for Australia. There are
about 350 Australian companies operating in Hong Kong with about
30,000 Australians living and working in the former British colony.</P>

      <P>Negotiators from Taiwan and the United
States gathered in Taipei Wednesday to begin a new round of
consultations on terms for Taiwan's entry into the World Trade
Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>The Taiwan and US delegations were headed, respectively, by Chen
Ruey-long, recently appointed director-general of the Board of
Foreign Trade (BOFT), and David Burns, the US Trade Representative
Office's director for Asia-Pacific Affairs.</P>
      <P>At the beginning of the meeting, Burns congratulated Chen on his
promotion by saying that he will be the last BOFT head to hold trade
negotiations with the United States. The comment was taken as a sign
that officials from the two sides have a good chance of reaching
agreement on various trade issues in the 16th round of trade talks.</P>
      <P>Discussions on the first day of the week-long trade negotiations
centered on the capacity of assets held by foreign insurance
companies to cover liability and on the ROC government's medical
pricing system. The two sides, however, failed to reach any
consensus.</P>
      <P>During subsequent meetings over the next few days, discussions
will focus on Taiwan's governmental procurement systems, and on the
opening of local agricultural, insurance, stock brokerage,
telecommunications and service markets.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and the United States have conducted 15 rounds of trade
talks since February 1994. Among 26 WTO signatory nations which have
requested bilateral talks with Taiwan, agreements have been reached

    <HEADLINE>A TASTE OF LIFE IN EXILE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  16  (CNA)
(By Debbie Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Although they are legal ROC citizens,
entitled to vote or even to be elected president, they have not fared
very well in Taiwan over the past 20 years or so.</P>
      <P>They are 102 Tibetan children the ROC government received from
India and Nepal following a failed uprising against Chinese Communist
rule in Tibet some two decades earlier. They settled in the
now-defunct Tibetan Children's Home, a charity organization
established by the Chinese Refugees Relief Association, in Taipei in
1980.</P>
      <P>Nearly 20 years later, the children, whose parents either
perished or fled during the conflict, are now adults.</P>
      <P>About half of them dropped out of the educational system after
graduating from junior high school and joined Taiwan's fiercely
competitive job market, taking jobs in the service industries or in
the labor-intensive manufacturing sector.</P>
      <P>Some of them even insisted upon working while they were still
students, which contributed to the high ratio of dropouts among them.
It also proved to be a major setback for the Tibetan Children's Home
program, whose directors had hoped to provide the youths with a good
education before they entered the world as adults.</P>
      <P>Among the 102 Tibetans, only two managed to receive a college
degree, and another one emigrated to the United States.</P>
      <P>As for the rest, 19 are studying in high school-level vocational
institutes, 11 are currently serving in the military, and two are
serving jail terms. About a dozen others travel frequently among
Taiwan, India and Nepal, "perhaps doing business," according to a
consultant at the Tibetan Youths Home, which superseded the
children's orphanage.</P>
      <P>While most of the young men and women never regained contact with
any of their family members, they consider the residents of the home
to be their brothers and sisters. They live in a close-knit
environment both physically and psychologically, but seldom make new
acquaintances outside the group, said the consultant.</P>
      <P>Although most of the Tibetans lead less-than-rewarding lives in
Taiwan, none of them want to leave the island. One young man who
arrived in the orphanage at the age of five, said he wants to earn
more money in Taiwan after graduation to send to family members who
still reside in Nepal.</P>
      <P>Two sisters among the group are not so lucky. They also desire to
accumulate a fortune in Taiwan, but have no one to share with their
earnings. The sisters were too young when they first arrived here and
they have no documents or information about their parents or other
relatives.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Kao Koong-lian, chairman of the Cabinet-level
Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, said Taipei is continuing
its policy of helping exiled Tibetan youths from India and Nepal.</P>
      <P>Currently, he said, the commission welcomes high-school graduates
to receive college or university education in Taiwan, hoping that the
young Tibetan men and women will return to Tibet, India or Nepal
after graduation to contribute more to their people.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CSBC SEEKING INVESTORS FOR PRIVATIZATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  16  (CNA)
(By Debbie Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The China Shipbuilding Corp. (CSBC) is
targeting Taiwan's leading shipping companies and business
conglomerates as potential investors to facilitate privatization of
the state-run corporation, government sources reported on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Some 20 would-be investors, including Evergreen Group, Yangming
Marine Transport, Chinese Maritime Transport, Formosa Plastics Group,
Tungtex Group, China Steel Corp. and Chi Mei Corp., will be invited
to an investment workshop in late November to work out strategies for
listing the Kaohsiung-based CSBC on the Taiwan Stock Exchange.</P>
      <P>According to officials from the Commission of National
Corporations (CNC), which is actively pushing for the CSBC's
privatization, the CSBC's four-year restructuring project embarked on
some two years ago has shown little promise for the debt-ridden
corporation.</P>
      <P>The CSBC seems to have few choices but to accelerate the
privatization process due to an assortment of factors, including a
hefty payroll of 5,600 employees, a NT$14 billion (US$491 million)
bill to be footed upon privatization as retirement pension funds or
layoff payments, and continually sagging business turnover, CNC
officials pointed out.</P>
      <P>The CSBC, whose shareholders include the Ministry of Economic
Affairs (holding 87.32 percent of the firm's stock) and Chinese
Petroleum Corp. (10.32 percent), currently has a capitalization of
NT$16.9 billion (US$593 million).</P>
      <P>To facilitate its application for listing on the Taiwan Stock
Exchange, the CSBC will re-evaluate its land assets and trim its
capitalization by NT$5.9 billion (US$207 million) to some NT$11
billion (US$386 million), the officials noted.</P>
      <P>The CSBC's large payroll is the major obstacle to the
corporation's plans to go private, the officials said, citing
comments by a spokesman for the Evergreen Group, which has indicated
its interest in buying into the state-run shipbuilder. The spokesman
was quoted as saying that Evergreen would like to take it over "right
away," if the CSBC staff is not included in the transfer.</P>
      <P>Earlier this week, CSBC authorities had categorically denied that
the company was negotiating any acquisition or merger bids with local
business groups.</P>
      <P>Commenting on news reports that Evergreen, which operates the
world's largest container shipping fleet, intends to buy into the
CSBC, and that the Formosa Plastics Group, Taiwan's largest private
conglomerate, is also interested in acquiring the CSBC, the spokesman
said "all such reports are untrue."</P>
      <P>In addition to building commercial vessels, the CSBC is also
capable of building various types of warships, including missile
frigates and high-speed patrol boats.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HI-TECH EMPLOYEES URGED TO HEIGHTEN SAFETY AWARENESS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 16 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Safety personnel in the nation's industrial
sector should be given higher positions and employees at high-tech
plants should be educated on fire-prevention techniques, participants
at a seminar on safety awareness said.</P>
      <P>The seminar on accident prevention in hi-tech industries was held
at the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park Wednesday, in the wake
of a recent series of fires there.</P>
      <P>The participants were unanimous on the need to prevent the
occurrence of such incidents in the future, especially after a
disastrous fire at the United Integrated Circuit Corp., an affiliated
company of major wafer supplier United Microelectronics Corp. (UMC),
in early October caused losses estimated at NT$15 billion (US$523.64
million).</P>
      <P>Winbond Electronic Corp., another company in the park, also lost
nearly NT$10 billion (US$348.43 million) as a result of a fire in
October 1996.</P>
      <P>Chen Huei-tai, manager of Fubon Insurance Company, cited figures
for facilities in Silicon Valley in the United States to emphasize
the magnitude of the losses suffered by the two companies in the
Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park.</P>
      <P>He said that data from a consulting company in Silicon Valley
indicates that total losses from fires at the US hi-tech mecca
amounted to only NT$800 million (US$27.87 million) over a ten-year
period between 1983 and 1993.</P>
      <P>Chang Chih-yuan, Winbond assistant vice president, said that in
the past year alone, there have in fact been several fire-related
accidents at the Hsinchu facility, causing losses of up to several
hundred thousand New Taiwan Dollars for each individual company.</P>
      <P>Chang attributed the frequent outbreak of fires in the industrial
park to several reasons. For one thing, he said, companies are often
in a rush to complete construction and request contractors to work
overtime, often at the expense of proper safety precautions. At one
time, Winbond had as many as 700 laborers on a single construction
site.</P>
      <P>Chang said substandard safety control techniques practiced by the
companies is another factor. Factory equipment may originate from a
variety of places, including Japan, Germany and the United States,
and may utilize many diverse fire-prevention mechanisms, which makes
it difficult to achieve an effective integrated safety system.</P>
      <P>He also said that thermoelectric heaters are the most frequent
sources of accidents, with between 50 percent and 60 percent of
fire-related incidents at the park being directly attributable to
heating units for factory equipment.</P>
      <P>He proposed that resident companies in the facility work out a
uniform safety code to govern the plant construction and operations.</P>
      <P>Participants in the seminar also suggested that safety personnel
be given greater authority in carrying out their duties and that a
section of the industrial park in Hsinchu and of one located in
Tainan be set aside for building fire-prevention training centers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MIXED REACTION TO APPEAL FOR LIFT OF 'THREE LINKS' BAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  16 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The appeal of a Taiwan shipping tycoon to
lift bans on three areas of direct contact between the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait polarized the Legislature on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Y.F. Chang, chairman of Evergreen Marine, criticized the
government's continuing restrictions on the "three links" -- direct
trade, postal and transportation exchanges -- with the mainland.</P>
      <P>Chang also said that he is willing to act as an emissary on
behalf of the ROC government in the cross-strait dialogue if the need
arises. He made the comments in an interview published on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Legislator Hsieh Chin-chuan of the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party, said that Chang's remarks were based solely on
commercial interests and that he had disregarded the safety of 21
million people on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tsai Ming-hsien, another DPP legislator, said that Taiwan's
security should be given the first priority, pointing out that at a
time when Beijing still continues threaten Taiwan with the use of
force, the ROC government will only bring humiliation upon itself if
it is too enthusiastic in opening the three links.</P>
      <P>Lee Ching-hua of the opposition New Party said that the
government ban has become intolerable to Taiwan businessmen, and with
its utility as a bargaining chip in dealing with Beijing gradually
diminishing, it stands only as a self-defeating policy.</P>
      <P>Lee questioned whether the "three no's" imposed by the government
are an effective deterrent to mainland aggression against Taiwan,
adding that if Taiwan wants to develop into an Asia-Pacific
operations center and to join World Trade Organization, direct links
across the Taiwan Strait are imperative.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chu Huei-liang of the New Party said the blast by Y.F.
Chang, who called restrictions on the three links "naive," and
similar comments made recently by Wang Yung-ching, chairman of the
Formosa Plastics Group, reflect the sentiments of most Taiwan
businessmen.</P>
      <P>But she opposed the idea of business leaders like Chang acting as
emissaries in the cross-strait dialogue, saying that they will be
unable to maintain an objective stance because of their vested
interests.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chen Ching-pao of the ruling Kuomintang called for a
review of the government's National Unification Guidelines, saying
that the effectiveness of restrictions on direct contacts as
bargaining chips with Beijing is rapidly eroding due to the massive
influx of foreign capital into the mainland in recent years.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, an opinion poll showed that only 13.6 percent of the
public believes that the ban on the three links should be lifted
unconditionally.</P>
      <P>The poll, commissioned by the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) and conducted in August, also found that 75.8 percent
of the respondents felt that the direct contacts should be
established under certain conditions.</P>
      <P>The MAC noted that it is impossible to conduct direct trade
without maintaining direct cross-strait transportation links, but
that direct air and sea travel must involve matters of national
security and dignity.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC-US WTO TALKS NOT TO TOUCH ON 'NON-APPLICATION' CLAUSE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  16  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has absolute rights to determine
whether to exclude mainland China from the application of
multilateral trade agreements after it formally joins the World Trade
Organization (WTO), a senior trade official said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>"We can decide completely in our own right whether to employ the
WTO's 'non-application' provision toward mainland China after we
become a full member of the Geneva-based trade regulatory body," said
Chen Ruey-long, director-general of the Board of Foreign Trade
(BOFT).</P>
      <P>Chen was commenting on reports that ROC and US negotiators will
discuss the "non-application" issue during their current round of
consultations on terms for Taiwan to join the WTO.</P>
      <P>"We do not need to discuss this issue with any particular WTO
member as a prerequisite for our entry to the organization," Chen
said, adding that the issue is not included in the agenda for the
16th round of WTO talks between the Republic of China and the United
States, which opened in Taipei on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The WTO charter provides for non-application of multilateral
trade agreements between particular members.</P>
      <P>Chen said Taiwan has not yet considered whether to employ this
"non-application" clause toward mainland China after it joins the
WTO.</P>
      <P>Observers said Taiwan is not expected to reveal its stance on the
issue until the last minute.</P>
      <P>Touching on the current round of ROC-US WTO talks, Chen said the
two sides have reached agreement on the issue concerning Taiwan's
rates for mobile phone interconnection services.</P>
      <P>American negotiators have asked Taiwan to lower the mobile phone
interconnection charge, which stands at NT$1.6 (US$0.06) per minute
at present.</P>
      <P>"We have promised to review such service charges annually
starting next year," Chen said, adding that the US delegation is
satisfied with this promise.</P>
      <P>According to a Taiwan-US telecommunications service agreement
reached in July 1996, Taiwan will abide by general international
regulations governing telecommunications service rates.</P>
      <P>Chen said the state-run Chunghwa Telecom Co., which until now has
dominated Taiwan's mobile phone service market, has reached
agreements with private groups which have been granted licenses to
operate mobile phone services later this year concerning the
interconnection service charge. "Chunghwa Telecom has promised to
adjust its rates annually based on its actual costs."</P>
      <P>Another topic discussed on Thursday morning was an allegation by
the United States that Taiwan Glass Co. has violated the fair trade
law by dominating the island's float glass market. Chen told American
negotiators that investigations by Taiwan's Fair Trade Commission did
not substantiate the US allegation. "The Fair Trade Commission will
further probe the issue if American businessmen can provide
additional evidence," Chen said.</P>
      <P>In the afternoon, the two sides discussed technical details
concerning the establishment of an EMC examination system and
certain alleged intellectual property rights violations.</P>
      <P>The two sides will discuss issues related to tariff reductions
on a number of industrial products, government procurement and
opening of agricultural and service markets from Friday through next
Monday.</P>
      <P>The ROC-US WTO talks have lasted for several years. David Burns,
the chief officer in charge of Asia-Pacific affairs at the Office of
the US Trade Representative, said on Wednesday that he is convinced
that Chen Ruey-long will be the last BOFT head to preside over the
talks.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ISSUE OF THREE LINKS TO BE RESOLVED NATURALLY BY MUTUAL RESPECT: KOO</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 16 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In response to Taiwan shipping tycoon Chang
Yung-fa's protest against Taipei's continuing ban on direct trade,
transportation and communication links with mainland China, C.F. Koo,
chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation, said Wednesday that the
interests of the nation must be Taiwan's top priority and that the
issue of the "three links" would be resolved naturally if both sides
could show respect to each other.</P>
      <P>The key to the bilateral relationship between the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait is whether Beijing will recognize Taipei as an
equal political entity, Koo added.</P>
      <P>Koo said that Taipei is not likely to open the "three links" in
the near future, but he noted that there are in fact already some
cross-strait links.</P>
      <P>Koo also emphasized the development of relations between the two
sides won't regress and that Taipei is indeed following a "no-haste,
be patient" position. He added, however, this position is not
intended to last forever but that it would change depending on
conditions in the future.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of world-renowned classical
musicians, including Chinese-American cellist Yo-Yo Ma, staged an
open rehearsal Thursday in downtown Taipei's National Concert Hall to
a packed audience.</P>
      <P>In preparation for their long-awaited performance in Taipei with
the National Concert Hall Orchestra, Ma, violinist Lin Chao-liang,
and pianist Yefim Bronfman joined in a rendition of a Beethoven piece
led by conductor Jaime Laredo.</P>
      <P>Three of the musicians -- Yo-Yo Ma, Lin Chao-liang and Chang
Yu-ting -- are scheduled to meet President Lee Teng-hui at the
Presidential Office on Friday prior to the group's performance that
evening at the National Concert Hall.</P>
      <P>The members of the group said they had great expectations for
their performance in Taipei and that working together presented them
with a new artistic challenge.</P>
      <P>They said they hoped to achieve new musical achievements
performing together in Taipei and to present classical music lovers
here with an evening of exceptional music.</P>
      <P>Perhaps spurred on by the massive publicity here for the
performance, Taipei has been struck with "classical music fever."</P>
      <P>Tickets for Friday's performance were sold out two weeks ago, and
public demand has been so strong that the event's organizers have
promised to set up loudspeakers and a giant-screen television in the
large square outside the concert hall so more people can enjoy the
performance.</P>

(By Bill Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A US expert on Asian affairs said
Wednesday that mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin is insisting on
speaking at Harvard University during his visit to the United States
later this month because Harvard trumps Cornell University, where
President Lee Teng-hui of the Republic of China delivered a speech in
1995.</P>
      <P>Douglas Paal, president of the Asia-Pacific Policy Center, told a
panel discussion here sponsored by the Heritage Foundation that Jiang
is associated with a more moderate approach to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As a result, Paal noted, Jiang was embarrassed in 1995 and 1996
by the downturn in relations between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>Apart from his visit to Boston for the Harvard speech, Paal said,
Jiang's itinerary also includes a trip to Los Angeles after his talks
with US President Bill Clinton in Washington in an effort to appeal
to the strong pro-Taiwan elements there.</P>
      <P>Paal said that the subtext is how to trump Taiwan and how to keep
pro-Taiwan demonstrators away from the White House so that Jiang can
show that Beijing is actually gaining an upper hand in Washington.</P>
      <P>However, Paal said that this is really an uphill struggle for
Jiang, especially in the US Congress.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Finance (MOF) on Thursday
said it was looking into the possibility of allowing foreign
investment in Taiwan's soon-to-open futures market.</P>
      <P>Vice Finance Minister Wu Chia-sheng told reporters that his
ministry is eager for futures trading to begin here and that it had
already requested opinions from the Central Bank of China on the
prospect of allowing foreign investment in the new market.</P>
      <P>He said research was underway to determine if foreign investment
in the futures market should be permitted and, if so, what the
ceiling on that investment should be.</P>
      <P>Since the transfer of funds falls under the jurisdiction of the
central bank, the ministry has twice formally requested the central
bank's opinion regarding the opening of Taiwan's futures market to
foreign investment, Wu said.</P>
      <P>A specific outline of how the market would be opened up to
foreign investment will be drafted after the MOF and central bank
reach a consensus on the proposal, he said.</P>
      <P>A package of detailed regulations drafted in conformity with the
recently passed Futures Trading Law was approved at the Oct. 1
Cabinet meeting.</P>
      <P>The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and Singapore International
Monetary Exchange (SIMEX) have both said they support Taiwan opening
its futures market to foreign investment.</P>
      <P>The CME and SIMEX on Jan. 9 both launched trading in Taiwan stock
index futures, which have performed well enough to win the approval
of financial scholars and the financial community.</P>

Premier Li Peng will be replaced in March 1998. The atmosphere is
therefore appropriate for cross-strait talks, he said.</P>

      <P>The economy, he added, is on track to hitting this year's target
growth rate of between 6 and 7 percent. In the first half of the
year, the economy grew by 5.9 percent, he noted.</P>
      <P>Goh made these points in a speech in Hong Kong to the Singapore
Networking Lunch, organized by Singapore's Economic Development
Board, The Straits Times reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>Singapore officials said later that the nearly S$7 billion in
investments to date, mainly in the electronics and chemicals sectors,
compares well with the figure of S$8.1 billion (US$5.2 billion) in
investments for the whole of last year, the report said.</P>
      <P>Singapore looks set to hit its target of $8.5 billion (US$5.5
billion) in investments by the end of this year, they added.</P>
      <P>In his speech, Goh repeated his view that while the ongoing
currency turmoil might mean slower growth in the region in the next
year or two, the medium and long-term prospects for ASEAN economies
are good.</P>
      <P>Goh was in Hong Kong for the East Asia Economic Summit organized
by the World Economic Forum. He returned to Singapore on Wednesday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND CHINA DENIES ROC LAWMAKER ACCESS TO ABDUCTED POLICEMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  16  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislator Tsaur Eel-jong (KMT-Matsu) on
Thursday expressed disappointment at mainland China's refusal to
allow him to meet with a Taiwan marine policeman who was abducted to
the mainland on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Tsaur left for the city of Fuzhou in mainland China's coastal
Fujian province on Monday to seek the early return of Chuang
Chen-yao, a local marine police officer who was abducted by mainland
fishermen while performing a search of a mainland fishing vessel
caught fishing illegally in Taiwan's territorial waters on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Tsaur said Fujian officials in charge of Taiwan affairs told him
that Chuang is in stable condition after receiving emergency hospital
treatment for head injuries.</P>
      <P>However, Tsaur said mainland officials refused to tell him where
Chuang was sent after receiving the emergency treatment.</P>
      <P>Tsaur quoted mainland sources as telling him that Chuang has been
moved to another hospital, mainly in an attempt to reduce outside
interference and provide him with better medical services, rather
than because of any worsening of his condition.</P>
      <P>The mainland officials also denied reports that Chuang has been
admitted to a military hospital, Tsaur said.</P>
      <P>During his stay in Fuzhou, Tsaur said he was not permitted an
opportunity to meet with Chuang.</P>
      <P>According to Taiwan press reports, the marine policeman was
abducted when two Taiwan marine police patrol boats intercepted and
boarded a mainland fishing vessel which had intruded into waters off
the island of Matsu, which is controlled by Taiwan but located close
to the mainland. Nine policemen who boarded the mainland fishing boat
Ming Chang Yu 1448 were attacked by the mainland crew armed with
knives, axes and bottles.</P>
      <P>However, mainland authorities have a different account of the
incident. The Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait (ARATS) sent a letter to its Taiwan counterpart, the
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), on Wednesday, saying that the
mainland crew had accused Taiwan marine police of shooting at them
while their boat was returning home.</P>
      <P>The ARATS letter said that the mainland boat made no "suspicious"
moves when intercepted and boarded by the police. It also claimed
that the Taiwan move has affected the normal fishing operations of
mainland fishermen.</P>
      <P>SEF officials said copies of the ARATS letter has been sent to
the marine police corps and the cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council, which charts Taiwan's policy toward mainland China.</P>
      <P>The marine police corps is expected to provide a more detailed
report concerning the incident to the SEF, which will then inform the
ARATS of Taiwan's version of the incident.</P>
      <P>SEF officials said they will maintain contact with the ARATS in
order to arrange a visit to the mainland by SEF officials and
Chuang's family.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  16  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The following are excerpts from an
editorial carried in Thursday's edition of local English-language
daily the China News.</P>
      <P>Look Who's Talking Now</P>
      <P>The government is under siege, but this time it is not from
without. The island's most reclusive billionaire and long-time friend
of President Lee Teng-hui, Evergreen Chairman Chang Yung-fa, has
added his voice to a growing chorus of calls in favor of lifting the
ban on direct cross-strait links.</P>
      <P>Let's see where the battle lines have been drawn: On the one
side, there is Formosa Plastics Group's Wang Yung-ching, President
Enterprises' Kao Chin-yuen, Pacific Electric wire and Cable's Suen
Tao-tsuen and 30,000 small- and medium-sized enterprises. On the
other is Chinatrust Group Chairman Koo Chen-fu... KMT business
manager Liu Tai-ying... The KMT and its traditional power base,
however, is split, with the promise of more fireworks to come as
players and followers rush to join the action.</P>
      <P>It is hard to imagine how (President) Lee will be able to parry
the latest blow to his "be patient, no haste" policy on mainland
investment by Taiwanese companies. To be sure, Chang and Wang,
Taiwan's two preeminent industrialists... will not be easily denied
the pursuit of their aims. Both have multinational conglomerates that
form a huge chunk of Taiwan's economy... If the government insists on
squeezing them, they can afford to simply walk away...</P>
      <P>So far, both have chosen to play by the rules... But their
patience has been steadily running out. Operating costs are rising
steadily, market share is vanishing before their eyes in China, and
no progress seems to have been made in almost two years on improving
mainland relations. Now that Beijing has shown a willingness to get
talks back on track, the tycoons cannot afford the patience to stand
by and watch while the government shuffles its feet and plays coy.</P>
      <P>The government must accept that it can play a far more
constructive role as adviser if it works with its business leaders,
rather than against them... Taiwan should be seeking constructive
talks with China on matters affecting its businesses as soon as
possible, otherwise it will find that its worst fears have been
confirmed -- that it is too late, and the cards they were holding up
their sleeves for so long have vanished.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN WELCOME TO JOIN SICA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Oct.  16 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ernesto Leal, secretary general of the
System for Integration of Central America (SICA), said here on
Thursday that Taiwan is welcome to join SICA and that such a move
will benefit both sides.</P>
      <P>Leal made the remarks in a meeting with leaders of the local
business and academic sectors while speaking on Republic of China
President Lee Teng-hui's decision to join the organization.</P>
      <P>Lee made the decision during his September Latin American tour,
during which SICA member-nations issued a declaration welcoming
Taiwan to join as a non-regional member. Lee and the heads of state
of four Central American countries also signed several agreements to
boost mutual cooperation and enhance relations.</P>
      <P>SICA is a regional organization comprising six central American
countries -- Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua
and Panama.</P>
      <P>Leal argued that it is important for the ROC to grab the
opportunity to join SICA, especially at the present time, when SICA
members are seeking to strengthen trade and commerce relations with
the United States and Canada.</P>
      <P>According to Leal, President Lee decided to join SICA because "he
realizes SICA's potential and because of his desire to cement
substantive ties with countries in Central America."</P>
      <P>He added that the ROC's participation in SICA will help the
nation increase its presence in the international community and will
enable it to use the region as a springboard to break into the North
American market." "The ROC's participation in SICA will actually
benefit both sides," he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Leal also revealed that he had already exchanged opinions with
Premier Vincent Siew and Vice Premier John Chang on issues related to
Taiwan's participation in SICA.</P>
      <P>Leal is visiting Taiwan at the invitation of the Asia-Pacific
Public Affairs Forum, a private organization established to promote

results of a survey made public on Thursday by the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>The survey found that 91.7 percent of those interviewed support

for Taiwan's admission to the international organization.</P>
      <P>Asked what policy the government should adopt for joining the UN,
38.4 percent of those interviewed approve the "two equal political
entities, which will eventually be united" policy, while 29.2 percent
identify with the "one China, one Taiwan" policy. The "one China"
policy won 16.1 percent approval, and "two Chinas" policy had a 6.2

      <P>Seventy-one percent of those polled said that the government
should apply to join the United Nations as a full member, while 17.8
percent said that the government should join the organization as an

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Bank of China on Thursday
announced a cut in bank reserve requirements BY 0.5-1.5 percentage
points in a bid to help ease the tight capital market which has
caused local stock prices to plummet over the past few weeks.</P>
      <P>The cut, effective immediately, reduced the requirements for
check deposits by 1.5 percentage points (from 21.25 percent to 19.65
percent); demand deposits by 1.5 percentage points (from 19.25
percent to 17.75 percent); demand savings deposits by 1.5 percentage
points (from 11.75 percent to 10.25 percent); time deposits by 0.5
percentage points (from 8.25 percent to 7.75 percent); and time
savings deposits by 0.5 percentage points (from 6.25 percent to 5.75
percent).</P>
      <P>The new reductions bring the average weighted reserve requirement
down to 8.31 percent from the current level of 9.1 percent.</P>
      <P>In a hastily called news conference, CBC Deputy Governor Liang
Cheng-chin said that the move, the second by the CBC in less than a
month, is expected to release NT$96 billion (US$3.36 billion) into
the capital market. The CBC made a similar move on Sept. 25.</P>
      <P>The inefficient money supply has caused interest on inter-bank
loans to reach as high as 8 percent per annum or even higher, forcing
local banks to raise interest rates to attract deposits and to reduce
loans to customers. As a result, the private sector is now finding it
hard to secure loan services.</P>
      <P>Liang said that the CBC will continue to maintain a "moderate"
monetary policy by intervening in the market to either retrieve or
release money.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, as part of the government package of plans to revive
the sluggish stock market, the Finance Ministry announced on Thursday
afternoon that the ceiling on foreign investment in the local stock
market will be immediately raised from 25 percent to 30 percent of

      <P>With the improvement in standards of living
over the last few years, the mass media in Taiwan has continued to
grow, according to statistics released by the Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>Regardless of keen competition from the electronic media,
newspapers in Taiwan remain the main source of information for people
who want to know what is going on in the world. As of the end of
1996, there were 361 newspapers registered in Taiwan, an increase of
26 over 1995, the DGBAS statistics indicated.</P>
      <P>News agencies and magazines also saw faster growth last year, the
statistics showing that there were 242 news agencies and 5,480
magazines in Taiwan in 1996, an increase of 24 and 233, respectively,
over 1995.</P>
      <P>Taiwan had 5,325 publishing houses, 550 more than in the previous
year, and 1,615 record companies, 223 more than in 1995.</P>
      <P>In addition, there were 2,506 TV program producers last year and
2,659 radio program producers, up 10.3 percent and 7.7 percent,
respectively, over 1995, while the government approved 122
applications for the establishment of cable TV companies, 69 more
than in 1995.</P>
      <P>The motion picture industry, which has suffered a decline over
the past few years, was the only exception. In 1996, there were 285
film-makers in Taiwan, four fewer than in the previous year. The
government approved the release of 361 motion pictures, including 253
by foreign producers, a reduction of 14.5 percent over 1995.</P>
      <P>However, the decline has not stopped Taiwan's film industry from

    <TEXT>
      <P>Washington, Oct. 15 CNA) US President Bill Clinton should use his
Oct. 29 summit with mainland China's President Jiang Zemin in
Washington to make absolutely clear that mainland China's
reunification with Taiwan must be achieved by peaceful means and with
the consent of the 21 million people of Taiwan, an American expert on
Chinese affairs said in a paper released on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In a paper entitled: "The US Agenda at the Clinton-Jiang Summit,"
Stephen Yates, policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a US
think-tank, pointed that this US policy is firmly grounded in the
principles declared in the three joint communiques between Washington
and Beijing and in the policies outlined in the Taiwan Relations Act
of 1979.</P>
      <P>"Any resort to military intimidation or invasion will provoke an
American military response. Given Taiwan's success at establishing
democracy at all levels of government, any resolution to the
cross-(Taiwan) strait dispute must come about by democratic as well
as peaceful means," he said.</P>
      <P>Yates also urged Clinton to make clear to Jiang that the US will
not agree to stop selling defensive arms to Taiwan in order to get
Beijing's commitment to stop selling missiles and nuclear technology
to Iran and Pakistan.</P>
      <P>The US policy analyst also suggested that Clinton raise security,
trade and human rights issues with Jiang. Specifically, on security
issues, Clinton should urge Beijing to be more open about its
military spending and abide by international nonproliferation
treaties and regimes.</P>
      <P>He should also urge Beijing to reduce tariffs and non-trade
barriers and insist that Taiwan's bid to join the World Trade
Organization not be held hostage to mainland China's separate
application.</P>
      <P>In addition, Clinton's values agenda should address religious
persecution and human rights violations in mainland China. He should
suggest that mainland China sign and ratify the two United Nations
covenants on human rights, according to Yates.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN BANK SETS UP SYDNEY BRANCH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct.  16  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The International Commercial Bank of
China (ICBC) has become the first bank from Taiwan to have a largely
unrestricted branch in Australia.</P>
      <P>In an interview with CNA on Thursday, Jeff Cheng, the vice
president and general manager of the new ICBC branch in Sydney, said
the ICBC has room to expand now that the Australian government has
allowed it to set up the branch.</P>
      <P>Australia permitted the ICBC to set up a subsidiary in the Down
Under, Cathay Finance International, in August 1986.</P>
      <P>The subsidiary, however, was only allowed to accept 20 deposit
accounts per year and could not offer its clients checking accounts,
restricting its business substantially.</P>
      <P>But the Sydney branch has no such restrictions. It can not only
offer checking accounts but also accept many savings accounts. The
only restriction is that the minimum amount to open an account is
A$250,000 (US$184,000), with no restriction on the account size after
that, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>"I believe with our new branch we can do lots of business,
particularly from Australia-invested Taiwanese companies," he said.</P>
      <P>Up to the end of August this year, Cathay Finance International's
outstanding loans to its customers stood at A$112 million (US$82.4
million), up A$2.6 million (US$1.9 million) from July's level. Its
deposits totaled A$22.4 million (US$16.5 million), he said.</P>
      <P>But it took 11 years to reach these amounts, he noted.</P>
      <P>"From now on, we can increase our lendings and especially take
more deposits from our clients at a rapid pace," he said.</P>
      <P>He said as the two-way trade between the Republic of China and
Australia is expected to increase steadily, the ICBC branch can
expect more trade-related business from both Taiwanese and Australian
traders.</P>
      <P>Last year, the trade volume between the two countries was about
A$6 billion (US$4.4 billion) in favor of Australia.</P>
      <P>At the branch's opening ceremony Wednesday, Wang Kuo-jan, acting
representative of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in
Canberra, said he expects the ICBC branch to play a greater role in
servicing businesses related to trade between Taiwan and Australia.</P>
      <P>This bilateral trade only accounts for some 2 percent of Taiwan's
overall trade, Wang said.</P>
      <P>"There is great room for trade between Taiwan and Australia to
expand," he added.</P>
      <P>The ICBC branch will also play a major role in helping boost
Taiwanese investment in Australia and help overseas Chinese set up
business operations here, he said.</P>
      <P>The new branch will take over all of the operations of Cathay
Finance International by the end of this year, he said.</P>
      <P>Cheng said that the ICBC is planning to set up a similar branch
in Brisbane to serve that city's many Taiwanese businessmen and
immigrants.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ASIA-PACIFIC ECONOMIES CAN STILL ACHIEVE 7 PERCENT GROWTH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Oct.  16  (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The fallout from Southeast Asia's
currency crisis will be limited, and the Asia-Pacific region will
still be able to achieve 6.5 to 7 percent growth this year, according
to two economists from leading US stockbroking firm Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter.</P>
      <P>Stephen Roach, the firm's chief economist, said he expects the
shortfall in economic activity as a result of the currency turmoil to
be contained to the four worst-affected countries -- Thailand,
Malaysia, the Philippines and Indonesia -- and not spread to the rest
of the region.</P>
      <P>That will not have a major impact on the global economy, he
added. The ASEAN four account for just 3 to 4 percent of the global
gross domestic product.</P>
      <P>Excluding mainland China and India -- both unaffected by the
recent developments in the region -- Asia accounts for a surprisingly
small share of global gross domestic product (7 percent) and trade (4
percent), Roach pointed out.</P>
      <P>The regional currency crisis is similar to the one experienced by
Mexico in late 1994, and using Mexico as a model, the affected
countries will take at least a year to recover.</P>
      <P>Roach and Byron Wien, a Morgan Stanley strategist, spoke to
Morgan Stanley Asia's clients on Thursday on the topic: "How long can
the good times last?"</P>
      <P>"Morgan Stanley's global economics team is forecasting a little
more than 4 percent growth in world GDP over these two years, an
outcome that would represent the sharpest increase since 1987-88," he
said.</P>
      <P>There is likely to be a confluence of upside growth surprises in
the US, Europe and Latin America, and an emerging shortfall in Asia
will be only partly offset.</P>
      <P>Roach said Japan and the ASEAN region accounted for 12 percent of
the global GDP, but 85 percent of the GDP producing regions of the
world were showing surprising strength.</P>
      <P>The US Federal Reserve Board is expected to raise the federal
funds rate by 100 basis points next year and a similar tightening can
be expected next year in Germany.</P>
      <P>But given the 3.8 percent growth this year and the strong growth
forecast for next year, inflation will accelerate to 3.1 percent next
year from this year's 2.5 percent, which will spur the Fed into
action. But the risk of a recession is not expected till late 1999,
Roach said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOH AIMS FOR `OASIS OF TALENT' FOR SINGAPORE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Oct.  16 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong
on Wednesday spelt out his vision of Singapore as an "oasis of
talent," serving as a hub for business, talent, knowledge and
information, with global networks linking the world's three economic
growth engines of Asia, Europe and the Americas.</P>
      <P>To survive in the future, Singapore will need to be a "special
place for special people," drawing top talent from its major trading
partners to Singapore, he said.</P>
      <P>Goh outlined his vision for Singapore in a speech in Hong Kong,
The Straits Times reported on Thursday.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that making Singapore such a special place will
also benefit Singaporeans, who will enjoy a higher standard of living
in a cosmopolitan city.</P>
      <P>He told the gathering of top business leaders from around the
world that Singapore thrives on and values foreign talent. The
country welcomed foreign entrepreneurs, industrialists, bankers,
scientists, engineers, academics, artists, artisans and even
sportsmen into its society.</P>
      <P>These new additions to Singapore will help the country establish
links with its major trading partners and build up its networks
abroad.</P>
      <P>The drive to draw foreign talent will also impose discipline on
Singapore as it will have to strive to make the country as attractive
as possible.</P>
      <P>In 10 to 20 years' time, he said, Singapore will be a more
international, cosmopolitan city, as more foreigners move in. This
will bring about a gradual evolution of Singapore society.</P>
      <P>But some things will not change, he said, adding that the country
will want to retain its core culture so that it remains distinctively
Singaporean.</P>
      <P>During a question-and-answer session following his speech, Goh
was asked whether the government's open-door policy a sensitive issue
in Singapore?</P>
      <P>He acknowledged that some Singaporeans were concerned about
whether they and their children will be able to compete with talent
from abroad.</P>
      <P>These concerns will have to be addressed, he said, adding that he
would "take the time to address them."</P>
      <P>But Singaporeans, he said, can see for themselves that foreigners
have added value to the country. Without foreign companies,
Singaporeans would not have the high standard of living they now
enjoy.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CANADA TO HAVE BALANCED BUDGET SOON</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Oct. 15 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Canada's finances are in such a good shape
that the government will finally be able to wrestle down the budget
deficit, the nation's top financial official has announced.</P>
      <P>Finance Minister Paul Martin unveiled a better-than-expected
picture of Canada's federal deficit Wednesday when he told the House
of Commons finance committee the latest deficit is C$2O billion
(US$14.5 billion) lower than the previous year's.</P>
      <P>Economists who looked into the deficit improvement were surprised
at how fast the red has been evaporating -- faster than even the most
optimistic forecasters had believed possible.</P>
      <P>Martin said the 1996-97 deficit of C$8.9 billion (US$6.5 billion)
represents 1.1 percent of Canada's gross domestic product, the sum of
all goods and services produced in the country. He added that Canada
will soon have the first balanced budget in a generation. The last
time the books were balanced was in 1969-70.</P>
      <P>"The books are not balanced yet," he cautioned. "The dividend
will be small, but it will grow. ... There will not be an instant
windfall."</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOF RAISES CEILING ON FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN LOCAL BOURSE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  16  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In an attempt to boost the sagging local
bourse, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) on Thursday raised the ceiling
on foreign investment in individual publicly listed firms from the
current 25 percent of total stocks to 30 percent, a move which will
increase the quota of foreign investment in the bourse by US$17.4
billion.</P>
      <P>Taiwan stock prices took another plunge Thursday, due to the
shortage of cash on the financial market, with the benchmark index
shedding 264 points and dipping below the average level of this year.</P>
      <P>The move was announced by Minister of Finance Paul Chiu at a
hastily-called press conference, after an emergency meeting with
Central Bank of China (CBC) Deputy Governor Liang Cheng-chin,
Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Lu Daung-yen and other
senior financial officials.</P>
      <P>The maximum ownership of a firm by a single foreign investor was
also raised from 10 percent of the company's floated shares to 15
percent, said Chiu.</P>
      <P>Under the new measures, the quota for foreign investment in the
local bourse will go up by US$17.4 billion to about US$93 billion,
with US$56.2 billion-worth of quota still open for application, said
the minister.</P>
      <P>The statistics, prepared by the CBC, show that shares held by
foreign institutions accounted for 4.29 percent of the value of total
listed shares in August, compared to 3.53 percent last October.</P>
      <P>The approved sum of foreign investment in the local bourse, which
is still valid, stands at about 15 percent of the total value of
listed shares as of Oct. 4, against 8 percent as of the end of last
year, according to the same statistics.</P>
      <P>Chiu said the new measures are part of the government's efforts
to make the island into a regional financial center by 2000, when
capital will be able to flow in and out of the island freely.</P>
      <P>Response to questions from reporters, Liang said that the CBC's
"moderate money supplies" policy didn't alter in the wake of
Thursday's bourse plunge, with short term interest rates targeted at
between 7 and 7.5 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN URGED TO BOOST EDUCATIONAL EXCHANGES WITH SICA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Oct.  16 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ernesto Leal, secretary general of the
System for Integration of Central America (SICA), suggested on
Thursday that Taiwan boost educational exchanges with SICA
member-nations as a means of cultivating talent with global vision.</P>
      <P>Leal made the remarks during a meeting with Y.T. Lee, president
of Academia Sinica, Taiwan's highest-level academic research
institute.</P>
      <P>He proposed that Taiwan strengthen exchanges of teachers and
students with SICA member-countries in order to cultivate talent with
international vision, which he said will help the Republic of China
in its bid to play a more active role in the international community.</P>
      <P>According to Leal, SICA member-nations wish to strengthen mutual
understanding with foreign countries through all kinds of exchanges
and that both his current visit to Taiwan and ROC President Lee
Teng-hui's September Latin American trip are aimed at achieving this
purpose.</P>
      <P>However, Leal went on to say that while the ROC is very welcome
to "associate" with SICA, full membership in the regional
organization remains very difficult, due to the great geographical
distances and differences in the cultural backgrounds and customs of
the two sides.</P>
      <P>Echoing Leal's view, Lee agreed that educational exchanges will
not only increase academic levels on both sides, they will also help
reduce cultural barriers between them.</P>
      <P>Leal is visiting Taiwan at the invitation of the Asia-Pacific
Public Affairs Forum, a private organization set up to promote
Taiwan's international image.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINESE PEOPLE CREATE THE WORLD'S FOURTH-STRONGEST ECONOMIC POWER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  16  (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chinese people around the world, who
already constitute the world's fourth- or fifth-strongest economic
power, are expected to become even more influential in the world
economy, an ROC government report said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The Overseas Chinese Commission's report, entitled "Analysis of
the Economic Power of Overseas Chinese," is based on statistics
compiled by international magazines and organizations over the past
five years, a commission official said.</P>
      <P>The July 1992 issue of Britain's "Economist" magazine revealed
that the mobile assets (with stock shares excluded) held by Chinese
people (excluding those in mainland China) had reached between US$1.5
trillion and US$2 trillion.</P>
      <P>A report published by professor Jau Mei-chiao of Hong Kong
University in March 1992 said that about 80 percent of all overseas
Chinese live in Southeast Asian countries, where they control over 50
percent of the economic power in the area.</P>
      <P>The World Bank has predicted that the "Chinese economies" --
Taiwan, mainland China, Hong Kong and overseas Chinese -- will become
the world's fourth-strongest economic power in 10 years, behind only
the United States, Japan and Germany.</P>
      <P>The US-based "Fortune" magazine, in its October 1994 edition,
said that Asian countries attracted US$63 billion in foreign
investment in 1993, of which US$3.7 billion came from Japan, US$19.1
billion from Hong Kong, US$4.4 billion from Taiwan and US$2.7 from
Singapore. The figure was described as clear evidence that capital
from Chinese people played a vital role in foreign investment in
those Asian countries.</P>
      <P>Japan's Nihon Keizai Shinbun newspaper in October 1994 reported
that overall production value by overseas Chinese was estimated at
US$717.2 billion. In addition to the US$263.5 billion production
value in Taiwan and US$697.6 billion in mainland China, production
value by Chinese people around the world had a cumulative total of
US$1.67 trillion, a figure exceeded only by the United States, Japan
and Germany.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Outgoing Foreign Minister John Chang
emphasized on Thursday that the Republic of China's efforts to raise
its international profile is not aimed at challenging Beijing's
legitimacy but rather at making Beijing accept the existence of the
ROC as a sovereign state.</P>
      <P>At a farewell press conference, Chang, who assumed his new role
as vice premier on Sept. 1 but retained his position as foreign
minister while awaiting replacement on Oct. 20 by his successor,
Jason Hu, hinted that the ROC is expected to add one or two new
additions to its roster of diplomatic allies by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>Chang said that he is not a diplomatic militant, despite his
now-familiar official war-cry: "fight fire with fire," adding that
all he has done is try to represent the ROC in its capacity as a
sovereign state.</P>
      <P>Citing the improvement in the treatment accorded to President Lee
Teng-hui during his stopover in Hawaii in early September, and the
upgrading of levels of representatives to Taipei by several European
states, Chang said that Taiwan's international status has improved
during his over one year in office.</P>
      <P>He said he disagreed with the view that Taipei's international
diplomacy should take second place to its policy towards Beijing,
saying that in fact "diplomacy is what makes the island different
from Hong Kong." The former British colony reverted to Beijing's rule
on July 1 this year.</P>

passenger became inebriated and insisted upon smoking aboard the
plane, an EVA Airways spokesman said Friday.</P>
      <P>As a result, the captain of the plane was compelled to land at
Muscat Airport in Oman, where the passenger of Arabic origin was
turned over to local police.</P>
      <P>It is believed to be the first case involving violation of a
smoking ban imposed by ROC airlines on all international flights.</P>
      <P>The disruptive passenger, surnamed Alawamlah, boarded EVA Airways
flight No. 876 at Dubai Airport, bringing with him a bottle of Scotch
whisky.</P>
      <P>Alawamlah soon became tipsy and began to smoke. One hour and 43
minutes after departure from Dubai, crew members tried in vain to
prevent him from lighting up a second cigarette. When the flight
captain attempted to dissuade him, he was threatened by Alawamlah.</P>
      <P>The pilot then made the decision to land at the nearby Muscat
Airport in Oman, where Alawamlah was placed in the custody of local
police. Due to the delay, the plane arrived in Taiwan about two hours

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.   17   (CNA)
(By Debbie Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Among dozens of oriental-eyed,
straight-haired Taiwan schoolchildren busily playing the traditional
Chinese folk game "che-ling," two are particularly prominent with
their green eyes, curly hair and relatively darker skin.</P>
      <P>The two pupils, 11-year-old Anli and her younger brother Juofan,
10, are Paraguayans, but they can speak Mandarin fluently, wearing
the same uniforms as other Taiwan children who attend their local
primary school.</P>
      <P>"If you really want to learn the Chinese language and Chinese
culture, you must put the children in local schools," said Mrs.
Ceferino Valdez Peralta, mother of the two children, and wife of the
Paraguay's ambassador to the ROC.</P>
      <P>Mrs. Valdez and her diplomat husband chose to send their three
children, including the youngest, aged four, to attend Shihtung
Elementary School and a local kindergarten in Taipei's suburban area
of Tienmu instead of sending them to the nearby Taipei American
School or the Taipei European School because they want the kids "to
learn everything here."</P>
      <P>Attending the Shihtung school for only four months, Anli and
Juofan not only are able to handle their studies at the fifth and
fourth grade level, they can also play traditional Chinese folk games
like che-ling, lion dancing, and stilt walking.</P>
      <P>Anli, who is as zealous as her mother in learning Chinese
culture, found writing Chinese characters rather difficult at first,
according to her teacher, "The words she produced look just great,
although they appeared more as drawings than as writing."</P>
      <P>The three Valdez youngsters were standing proudly alongside other
students lined up under a banner at the gate of Shihtung Elementary
School on Thursday morning to welcome Paraguayan First Lady Maria
Teresa Carrasco de Wasmosy for a visit.</P>
      <P>The children sang Mandarin, Taiwanese and Spanish ballads to
greet Mrs. Wasmosy, who visited Shihtung to show gratitude for the
efforts made by the elementary school in providing a comfortable
learning environment for expatriate children.</P>
      <P>Mrs. Wasmosy has long dedicated herself to charitable work as
part of her efforts to help resolve the serious gap in wealth
distribution in Paraguay. She arrived in Taipei on Oct. 15 for a
five-day visit at the invitation of the ROC government.</P>
      <P>Anli and Juofan's quick adaptation to their studies would not
have been so easy if not for their parents' farsightedness.</P>
      <P>The Valdez's had Anli and Juofan begin learning basic Mandarin
conversation and the phonetic symbols before they headed for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The ambassador himself often appears at Shihtung, in jeans, to
watch the children study and to take them home after classes.</P>
      <P>Mrs. Valdez has also actively taken part in school activities at
Shihtung, teaching a children's English class at the school every
Wednesday afternoon.</P>
      <P>Paraguay is the ROC's sole diplomatic ally in South America and
the two countries enjoy close and cordial relations.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet's mainland policy planning
task force will meet in the near future to discuss the "three links"
issue, Vice Premier John Chang said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Chang, who concurrently serves as the convener of the special
task force, said the government has been paying close attention to
public opinion with regard to direct communications, transportation
and trade links with mainland China, commonly known as the "three
links."</P>
      <P>Chang said the opening of direct contacts across the Taiwan
Strait is not a simple issue, but rather one which requires prudent
evaluation from several different perspectives.</P>
      <P>"National security is a priority concern in formulating our
policy toward mainland China," Chang stressed, adding that the
government must always remain cautious in tackling the "three links"
issue.</P>
      <P>Chang's remarks came after shipping tycoon Chang Yung-fa strongly
urged the government in a recent newspaper interview to lift its
rigid ban on direct cross-strait shipping, trade and communications
links in order to sustain Taiwan's economic leverage.</P>
      <P>Chang assumed his new role as vice premier on Sept. 1 but has
retained his position as foreign minister while awaiting replacement
on Oct. 20 by his successor, Jason Hu.</P>
      <P>He also told a news conference on Thursday that the Republic of
China's diplomatic policy is by no means aimed at challenging
Communist China's legitimacy but rather at making Beijing accept its
existence as an "equal political entity."</P>
      <P>The outgoing minister of foreign affairs said he disagrees with
the view that the ROC's diplomatic initiatives should take second
place to its policy towards Beijing, stressing that the ability to
conduct its own international relations is what makes Taiwan
different from Hong Kong. The former British colony reverted to
Beijing's rule on July 1 this year.</P>
      <P>Despite his now-familiar war cry of "Fight fire with fire," Chang
said he is not a diplomatic crusader, adding that all he has done is
to merely exert the ROC's legitimate rights as a sovereign state.</P>
      <P>Chang said Taiwan's international status has risen during his
more than one year in the ROC's top diplomatic post, citing as
evidence the improved treatment accorded to President Lee Teng-hui
during his stopover in Hawaii in early September, and the upgrading
of the levels of representatives to Taipei by several European

    <HEADLINE>FUNDAMENTALS OF ECONOMY ROSY DESPITE SLUMP IN NT DOLLAR, SHARE PRICES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  17 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew stressed Friday that
the fundamentals of Taiwan's economy are in good order despite a
slumping New Taiwan dollar and falling share prices on the local
bourse.</P>
      <P>Siew made the remarks in a question-and-answer session at the
Legislative Yuan, saying finance officials had reached that
conclusion in a meeting 10 days ago.</P>
      <P>His comments followed another free fall in the stock market which
saw the weighted index, the market's key barometer, shedding 165.66
points to end at 7,832.15 after plunging below the 8,000-point
threshold Thursday.</P>
      <P>Heavy selling of the New Taiwan dollar also emerged Friday
morning amid signs that the Central Bank of China (CBC) seemed to
abandon its defense of an exchange rate set at around NT$28.50 
Thursday. The rate fell to NT$29.035 in the morning session in the
forex market, the lowest rate in nearly a decade.</P>
      <P>However, Siew said that Taiwan's exports, investment, price
levels and employment rates have been good over the past year, which
sets Taiwan apart from the Southeast Asian countries which are
reeling from recent financial crises.</P>
      <P>He said that the declining stock market has nothing to do with
the nation's fundamental economic base.</P>
      <P>Noting that deepening financial woes in Southeast Asia have
resulted in currency devaluation of 20 percent or more in Thailand,
the Philippines and Malaysia, as well as slight depreciations of the
Singapore dollar, Japanese yen and South Korean won, Siew said Taiwan
could not remain unaffected. Those downward trends, coupled with a
strong US dollar, have added to the pressure on the New Taiwan
dollar.</P>
      <P>As to whether finance officials should allow market mechanisms
alone to determine the exchange rate of the local currency vis-a-vis
the US dollar, Siew said that the CBC has chosen to take measures to
stabilize the forex market because of abnormalities and psychological
factors arising from the situation in Southeast Asia.</P>
      <P>CBC Governor Sheu Yuan-dong echoed Siew's words by saying that
the lackluster performance of the stock market has resulted in part
from fears on the part of investors over the fate of the local
currency.</P>
      <P>Sheu also maintained that the fundamentals of Taiwan's economy
are sound, and that any "problems," whether in stock or forex markets
are "not serious at all."</P>
      <P>Sheu said that economic growth is occurring at a faster pace than
that seen last year, and that foreign reserves stand at a healthy
US$87 billion despite the recent selling off of US$5 billion to help
buoy the exchange rate of the New Taiwan dollar.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has no foreign debt, and enjoys an overall trade surplus
of US$10 billion. In addition, Taiwan has a stable price index level,
the New Taiwan dollar has not been overvalued, and neither the
island's large nor small-scale enterprises have reason to lose
confidence, Sheu said.</P>
      <P>Sheu said the financial crisis in Southeast Asia has seen limited
effect in Taiwan, pointing out that total imports and exports to that
region amount to less than US$1 billion, and that Taiwan's export
goods do not overlap with those of the Southeast Asian nations.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), said during a visit
to Japan on Thursday night that he does not intend to seek a second
term as the territory's administrative head.</P>
      <P>In remarks to the press at a tea party, Tung made it clear that
although he will serve as the HKSAR chief executive for only one
term, he will do his best to lay a solid foundation for his
successor.</P>
      <P>Tung's disclosure came in response to a comment that, while his
policy address before the Hong Kong Provisional Legislative Council
earlier this month was imbued with a forward-looking perspective, its
goals will hardly be achievable if he does not seek another term.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LAWMAKERS CALL FOR ACTION TO HELP CONVICTED MURDERER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 17 (CNA)
(By Debbie Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Four legislators on Friday hosted a hearing
at the Legislative Yuan, calling for the government to establish a
private fund to render assistance to ROC citizens who have been
discriminated against in foreign courts or who have encountered
inhumane treatment overseas.</P>
      <P>The hearing was held in response to an appeal by the family of
Tzuo Ming-hsin, an ROC national and a permanent resident of Alaska
who was convicted of first degree murder there eight years ago and
sentenced to 198 years in jail.</P>
      <P>The prisoner's sister, Tzuo Hsiao-ling, told the lawmakers her
brother is innocent. The jury convicted him with no more direct
evidence than a tape containing vague sounds and conversation, she
said.</P>
      <P>In addition, she said, her brother has been discriminated against
and even tortured since he went behind bars eight years ago.</P>
      <P>The legislators called for concerted efforts by the government,
Taiwan private sector and news media both here and abroad to focus on
the case and render Tzuo timely assistance.</P>
      <P>If a private foundation can be established soon, there would be
enough money to hire US-based lawyers to fight for Tzuo, enabling him
to stand a better chance at justice, the lawmakers said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Dr. Yuan T. Lee, president of the Academia Sinica, the
top research institute in the ROC, and the winner of the 1986 Nobel
Prize in chemistry, on Thursday faxed a letter to ROC Representative
in the United States Jason Hu, urging him to help Tzuo.</P>
      <P>In his letter, Lee asked Hu to send ROC officials to contact Tzuo
and his attorneys to see if there is anything Taiwan can do to help.</P>
      <P>Lee also asked Hu to contact the US lawmakers who represent
Alaska to see whether they would be willing to gain more
understanding of Tzuo's case and thereafter voice their support for
his cause.</P>
      <P>Hu, who is departing his Washington post in two days to assume
his new job as ROC foreign affairs minister, told Lee that he and his
staff are trying their best to aid Tzuo. Since the Tzuo family is not
rich, Tzuo Ming-hsin will need a great deal of outside money before
he gets any access to justice, Hu said.</P>
      <P>Human rights organizations and charity foundations would be good
channels through which ROC diplomats could try to further Tzuo's
cause, he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lee disclosed he had added his voice to the call to
support Tzuo because the prisoner's son, Tzuo Tzu-cheng, wrote him to
ask for help.</P>
      <P>The junior Tzuo said he became acquainted with Lee two years ago
when he knocked on a door along his newspaper route to collect his
fee and was surprised to see the Nobel laureate appear. Tzuo said he
immediately pulled out the card that identified him as a paper boy
and asked Lee for his autograph.</P>

    <DATELINE>New  York,  Oct.  16 (CNA)
(By Ranan Huang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In a move that will create the world's
third largest credit rating agency, FIMALAC of France Thursday
announced an agreement to acquire Fitch Investors Service, L.P. from
the Van Kampen Group of Grand Haven, Michigan and other investors,
and merge with IBCA Limited, a London-based rating agency controlled
by the French company.</P>
      <P>According to a news release here Thursday, the new entity will be
known as Fitch IBCA, Inc., and will maintain dual headquarters in
London and New York.</P>
      <P>It said that under the agreement a new US company controlled by
FIMALAC will acquire 100 percent of Fitch for $175 million in cash.
Fitch IBCA management will have a significant equity-based
participation in the new company.</P>
      <P>Fitch IBCA will have combined revenues of US$105 million and over
550 employees in 18 offices worldwide. It will rank among the other
major rating agencies, Standard &amp; Poor's Ratings Group and Moody's
Investors Service, which together have long dominated the rating
business.</P>
      <P>FIMALAC, a diversified operating company created in 1991 with
interests in industry, communications and real estate, is controlled
by its chairman, Marc Ladreit de Lacharriere. Its shares trade on the
Paris Stock Exchange. And now Ladreit de Lacharriere will be chairman
of the new Fitch IBCA, while IBCA Chairman Robin Monro-Davies becomes
vice chairman and chief executive officer, and Fitch President
Stephen W. Joynt becomes president and chief operating officer.</P>
      <P>"This merger constitutes a unique opportunity to bring much
needed competition and an international perspective to the global
ratings business," commented Ladreit de Lacharriere. "It also
reflects FIMALAC's commitment to expanding its role as an

    <HEADLINE>POPULAR PARTY LEADER'S DEFECTION SEEN A CATALYST TO AUSSIE LABOR PARTY'S RETURN TO POWER (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct.  17 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The stunning defection of the leader of
Australian Democrats to the Australian Labor Party (ALP) is a
"political earthquake" and appears to be a catalyst for the return to
power of the ALP in the next election, political analysts say.</P>
      <P>Senator Cheryl Kernot, one of the most popular politicians in
Australia, announced on Thursday that she would quit the Senate and
resign as leader of the Australian Democrats, the fourth largest
party in this country, behind the Liberal, Labor and National
parties.</P>
      <P>One of her major purposes in joining the Labor Party, is to
remove the coalition government under Prime Minister John Howard
because of her outrage at the Howard government's policies and
frustration that the Democrats were unable to influence them.</P>
      <P>"I have reached the conclusion that, for me, the imperative at
the next federal election lies not in battling to extract a share of
the third party vote to keep balance of power in the Senate," she
said.</P>
      <P>"It is to play a more direct role in the removal of the coalition
government. It is to stop the enormous damage the coalition parties
are doing to the fabric of this society," she said.</P>
      <P>The coalition government is formed by the Liberal and National
parties.</P>
      <P>Associate Professor C.L. Chiou of the University of Queensland
said: "Kernot's defection to the Labor Party is a political
earthquake because she is a popular and influential politician. She
could be a catalyst for the return of ALP power in the next
election."</P>
      <P>He said Kernot will not only help the Labor Party win women
voters, but also attract considerable votes from the Democrats Party
she successfully led over the past four years.</P>
      <P>The Democrats Party recently won an impressive victory in the
election in South Australia, closing the Liberal Party's hold on
power in the state government to a thin majority.</P>
      <P>Chiou, who met Kernot twice, said she is friendly towards Taiwan
and is sympathetic to Taipei.</P>
      <P>"To me and many people, Cheryl Kernot is an intelligent,
compassionate and farsighted politician with prime ministerial
material," Chiou said.</P>
      <P>Australian analysts said Kernot's departure was mainly due to
"self-interest" in pursuit of her personal ambitions.</P>
      <P>Howard even warned that her defection could rebound on the Labor
Party, destabilizing current ALP head Kim Beazley's leadership and
being perceived as a "betrayal of her own party members."</P>
      <P>"Cheryl Kernot senses a leadership vacuum in the Labor Party and
she wants to fill it," Howard said, adding "Kernot's decision was all
about Cheryl Kernot's personal ambition, nothing else."</P>
      <P>Chiou said Kernot has the qualities of a prime minister. But she
is unlikely to become the leader of the ALP in the next few years.</P>
      <P>"She could become the ALP leader in the future. She is only 48
years old and I believe she could wait until her time comes," he
added.</P>
      <P>Most Labor Party heavyweights rejected Howard's warnings, saying
that Kernot would not threaten their positions.</P>
      <P>Beazley said Kernot would "bring new ideas and new blood" to the
Labor Party, playing an important role in the renewal and resurgence
of the party.</P>
      <P>"I'm delighted that such a talented and highly regarded leader of
a political party will now seek to play a role in the renewal of the
Australian Labor Party and in its return to government at the federal
level," he said.</P>
      <P>Beazley's deputy leader, former foreign minister and now
opposition Treasurer Gareth Evans, said: "I feel absolutely no sense
of personal threat whatsoever. This is a team exercise and, my God,
what a fantastic new contribution to the team Cheryl's going to
make."</P>
      <P>Former Labor Party Prime Minister Paul Keating welcomed the move,
saying Kernot would add "depth and luster and bring experience and
understanding to the next Labor government."</P>
      <P>Beazley has promised that he will "move heaven and Earth" to
secure Kernot a senior Cabinet post if the ALP pulls off an
improbable win at the next election.</P>
      <P>ALP national secretary Gary Gray said Kernot would campaign
across the country to boost Labor votes for the next election -- "not
just in marginal seats but everywhere."</P>
      <P>Democrats members did not feel bitter over Kernot's defection.
Sam Hudson, Kernot's former chief of staff and the Democrats'
honorary national secretary, predicted that party members would
accept her decision and move on without resentment.

    <TEXT>
      <P>Don Chipp, founder of the Democrats Party, said: "You've got to
admire her courage for doing it, and her conviction."</P>
      <P>A former Labor Party minister, David Beddall, even offered to
vacate his seat of Rankin in Queensland for Kernot.</P>
      <P>But Kernot could also contest the seat of Dickson in Brisbane in
the election to become a federal member of the House of
Representatives. She may even compete with Pauline Hanson at Oxley in
Brisbane if former Queensland Premier Wayne Goss does not fully
recover from a recent brain tumor operation, analysts said.</P>
      <P>In a statement, Kernot said: "I am giving up the leadership of a
party, I'm moving on my own to uncharted territories, I don't know
whether I will win, succeed or fail and I am hurting a lot of people
that I care very much about."</P>
      <P>Kernot was critical of the coalition government's handling of
Australian aboriginal people and the Asian immigration issue.</P>
      <P>She made indirect reference to independent Member of Parliament
Pauline Hanson, saying she had watched as the coalition government
allowed "an agent of division to vilify and scapegoat black
Australians and migrants under the cloak of free speech."</P>
      <P>"I have found it increasingly difficult to stand in the middle,
trying to be endless fair to both sides (government and the
opposition) when I have grown so alarmed by the kind of politics
being played out by the coalition," she said.

    <TEXT>
      <P>But Howard rejected her criticism, saying: "Cheryl Kernot has
always taken what you could regard as the Labor point of view."</P>
      <P>To the Democrats, the departure of Kernot is a great blow because
she had led the party successfully since she took the reins. But the
departure also reflected her limited ability to wield influence in
the Australian political landscape, analysts said.</P>
      <P>Some analysts said Kernot's switch to the Labor Party was the
most important development since John Howard's triumph in March last
year.</P>
      <P>Michael Gordon, a senior writer for mass-circulation newspaper
The Australian, said: "It represents a stunning coup for Kim Beazley
and Gareth Evans, who began making overtures to Kernot in 1993, and a
calculated risk for the former leader of the Democrats.</P>
      <P>"While Kernot represents a long-term contender for the Labor
leadership, the immediate consequence of the shift is to strengthen
the position of Beazley, whose biggest achievement in the job has
been a modest one: simply keeping the show together after last year's
defeat (of Paul Keating)," he said.</P>
      <P>Beazley was never in any danger of being challenged before the
next election and, by enhancing the Labor Party's prospects, Kernot
also has increased Beazley's chances to head the party.</P>
      <P>Nor does her arrival change the dynamics of the contest between
Simon Crean and Gareth Evans for the status of likely successor, for
both see her arrival as a massive boost to the Labor Party's
re-election prospects.</P>
      <P>Gordon and some other analysts believed Kernot's arrival
represents a circuit-breaker for a party struggling to present a new
face to the electorate.</P>
      <P>Kernot is expected to play a key role in arriving at a sensible
compromise between market economics and government intervention, and
selling it to the electorate, Gordon said.</P>
      <P>Like former Labor Prime Minister Bob Hawke in 1980, Kernot can
expect to play a critical role in the election campaign, commanding a
profile disproportionate with the status of unelected candidate and
certain member of the front bench if she succeeds.</P>
      <P>But the key question is whether Australian voters will upgrade
their view of the Labor Party in the light of their opinion of Kernot
or simply downgrade their view of Kernot in the light of their view
of the Labor Party.</P>
      <P>Will Kernot, as Keating said Thursday, add luster to the Labor
Party? Or will she be tarnished by the association?</P>
      <P>"Will she be seen as someone who will make the bastards honest by
joining them? Or will the disaffection with the main parties simply
contaminate her?" Gordon said.</P>
      <P>Will Kernot become the Australian leader at some point in the
future?</P>
      <P>"Let's see how she performs after joining the Labor Party," Chiou

    <HEADLINE>NEW BARGAIN NEEDED BETWEEN TAIPEI AND BEIJING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  16 (CNA)
(By Bill Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Washington think tank has suggested
that new realities across the Taiwan Strait make it incumbent to have
a new Beijing-Taipei bargain that can accommodate Beijing's
imperative for "one China" and Taipei's desire for formal recognition
as an autonomous political actor.</P>
      <P>The Progressive Policy Institute said in a just-released paper
that a new understanding would likely mean a protracted two-phase
process: reaching an interim understanding meeting both sides'
minimum needs and a commitment to pursue a long-term process of
dialogue on what forms a "one China" arrangement might eventually
take.</P>
      <P>It said that the new interim understanding, to cover a period
which could last a generation, would be based on a "one China policy"
principle flexibly applied, adding that a cross-strait summit would
be the appropriate forum to launch the framework for a new
understanding, and that an initial quid pro quo would be at least a
tacit for Beijing renunciation of the use of force in exchange of
Taipei's renunciation of an independence option.</P>
      <P>In returning for putting the independence idea in deep freeze, it
argued, Beijing and Taipei could build on precedents to allow Taiwan
membership in international organizations and work out formulas that
would allow Taiwan the international political space it rightly
deserves.</P>
      <P>It went on to say that if mutually acceptable terms can be
reached, Taiwan could join the United Nations system, even with a UN
seat or observer status, and could be permitted full membership in
such UN institutions as the World Bank, the International Monetary
Fund, the World Health Organization, the International Atomic Energy
Agency and other technical agencies.</P>
      <P>Such a bargain is achievable if the political will exists on both
sides of the Taiwan Strait, it said, but complicating matters is the
fact that respective postures of both sides are shaped more by
domestic politics than by calculation of respective interests.</P>
      <P>It said that the question is whether Taipei is prepared to accept
"one China, two administrations" rather than "one China, two
sovereign governments." The difference is that, it noted,
paradoxically, by conceding to Beijing the principle of ultimate
sovereignty, the prospect of accommodating Taipei's desire for more
political space, or formal political recognition, might be realized.</P>
      <P>The report said that Taiwan's transformation from an
authoritarian political system to a free-wheeling pluralism cannot be
separated from a burgeoning sense of political identity, and it is
the island's democratic political life, and not just its history or
its vibrant economy, that is the primary cause of a feeling of
separateness from life in mainland China.</P>
      <P>It said that President Lee Teng-hui is correct in his assessment
that the majority of the island's residents have little desire to be
part of the People's Republic of China, adding that in polls over the
past five years, nearly 70 percent of residents of Taiwan express
this feeling indirectly by stating a preference for the continuation
of the status quo.</P>
      <P>The paper was prepared by Robert A. Manning while he was a
senior PPI fellow. Manning is currently a senior fellow at the
Council on Foreign Affairs.</P>

      <P>Singapore is fighting its worst oil
spill in history after a collision between a large crude carrier and
an oil tanker in the Singapore Straits on Wednesday night spewed
25,000 tons of oil into the sea.</P>
      <P>A major clean-up operation is now under way with 34 craft trying

    <HEADLINE>INTERNET EXPERIMENT IS ROBOTICS BREAKTHROUGH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  Oct. 16 (CNA)
(By David Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>T.J. Tarn, professor of systems science
and mathematics at Washington University in St. Louis, and his
doctoral student Kevin Brady earlier this year became the first
persons to control a robot live via the Internet.</P>
      <P>Tarn presented a paper explaining the technical aspects of this
accomplishment at the International Federation of Automatic Control
Symposium on Robot Control, held in September, in Nantes, France.</P>
      <P>On April 24, 1997, Brady pulled a joystick in Albuquerque, N.M.,
that controlled the motions of a Puma robot in Tarn's Washington
University laboratory more than 1,000 miles away. Standing on a
stage, Brady worked in tandem with the robot in front of hundreds of
engineers who watched the robot on a video monitor at the Institute
of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Robotics and
Automation Society Flagship Conference.</P>
      <P>The three-minute experiment was a difficult task for a robot: It
involved avoiding a box placed in its path to perform a manufacturing
task of picking up an object and placing it somewhere else. While
picking up and moving an object is routine robotics work, avoiding
the box and taking commands from a remote operator in real-time over
a crowded public network was extraordinary.</P>
      <P>The "teleoperations" feat was a major step for the burgeoning
field of robotics, and a giant leap for telecommunications, adding a
previously unexplored dimension to the Internet -- remote control --
and providing new horizons for other applications.</P>
      <P>Tarn envisions long-distance learning and research opportunities
where engineers and scientists, linked to a national laboratory,
could electronically experiment with robots and other areas of
service and manufacturing. Also, secondary school students could
perform hands-on science and engineering experiments. People from
divergent points then could share resources and save expenses.</P>
      <P>According to the Robotic Industries Association, the industry's
trade group, some 75,000 robots currently are at work in US
factories, placing the United States second only to Japan in robotics
usage.</P>
      <P>While the automotive industry is the dominant user of robotics,
there is growth in the appliance, pharmaceutical and textile
industries. In recent years, the robotics industry has averaged a 35
percent annual growth.</P>

      <P>The Yunlin Industrial Zone will become
operational when its first-stage development plan is completed at
the end of this month.</P>
      <P>The industrial zone at Yunlin, central Taiwan, will accommodate
85 high-tech manufacturers, and is expected to generate at least

    <HEADLINE>NOBEL LAUREATE PROMISES TO ASSIST IN TAIWAN'S SCIENCE DEVELOPMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>San  Francisco,  Oct.  16  (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Steven Chu, a Chinese-American
physicist who won this year's Nobel Prize in physics together with
two other scientists, said here on Thursday he is willing to assist
both sides of the Taiwan Strait in scientific development.</P>
      <P>Chu, a professor at Stanford University, told a news conference
for Chinese news media that he has twice visited Taiwan over the past
year. During those visits, Chu said he has established good relations
with Yuan T. Lee, president of Academia Sinica, Taiwan's highest
research institute, and gained some understanding of Taiwan's
eudcational and academic research systems and measures.</P>
      <P>Chu said it is a critical and encouraging development for Taiwan
that Academia Sinica, under the leadership of Yuan T. Lee, a
co-winner of the 1986 Nobel Prize in chemistry, has managed to
attract scores of very outstanding scientists to return to Taiwan to
join its research programs. "Many of them could have easily found
very good positions at prestigious American research institutes."</P>
      <P>However, Chu frankly pointed out that Taiwan still far lags
behind the United States in scientific research and development.</P>
      <P>Chu, who also once visited mainland China, said basic research
facilities are not enough in both Taiwan and mainland China.
"Moreover, they have to rely on the United States or European
countries for the supply of advanced research instruments and
equipment."</P>
      <P>The 49-year-old physicist further said independent thinking is
extremely important in scientific development. In this respect,
Chu noted that significant differences exist between Taiwan and the
United States. In Taiwan, students or researchers are usually
statisfied with one solution to a single problem, while Americans
like to seek different solutions to a same problem.</P>
      <P>Chu also suggested that Taiwan imporve its overall educational
and academic system by integrating teaching and research work in
universities.</P>
      <P>Chu said Taiwan's universities focus on teaching, while its
Academia Sinica concentrates on research. "The separation of
teaching from research will cause waste of resources and deprive
talented students of rights to do research," he noted, adding it is
unreasonable that academics with enough financial resources and
advanced research equipment do not join teaching work.</P>
      <P>At top-notch American universities, such as Stanford, Harvard and
Berkeley, Chu said, many outstanding scientists are obligated to
teach and guide students in research work.</P>
      <P>Both Chu and his father are Academia Sinica academicians. They
are the only father-son pair in the Taiwan's highest academic
institute.</P>
      <P>Chu was born and raised in the United States, but his parents
came from the Chinese mainland in the 1940s. Chu said he treasures
his Chinese roots and is willing to help boost scientific
development in both Taiwan and the mainland.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's National Science Council has invited Chu to
visit the island and deliver lectures to its youths. Premier Vincent
Siew has also sent a message to Chu congratulating him on winning the
Nobel laurel.</P>
      <P>Chu and two other scientists -- William Phillips of the
Uinted States and Claude Cohen-Tannoudji of France -- shared this
year's Nobel Prize in physics for developing ways of trapping
atoms of gas and cooling them to within a millionth of a
degree of nature's limit. The discovery has already led to more
accurate atomic clocks and a new form of matter whose existence
Einstein postulated in the 1920s.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  17  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew reiterated at the
Legislative Yuan on Friday that negotiations across the Taiwan Strait
should be led by the government as they concern the security and
welfare of the 21 million people in Taiwan. These issues would be
best served through the already established channels and systems, he
said.</P>
      <P>Siew made the remarks in response to a question from Hsie
Gin-tsuan, a legislator with the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP), about the DPP's proposal to allow multiple parties to
join the cross-strait negotiations.</P>
      <P>Siew noted that the Republic of China already has the Guidelines
for National Unification as its top principle for dealing with
Beijing, the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) for dealing with
political affairs and protocol, and the Straits Exchange Foundation
-- a semi-official organization mandated by the MAC -- to act as the
bridge between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. Cross-strait
negotiations would be best left to those established channels and
systems, he stressed.</P>
      <P>Technical and protocol affairs should remain Taipei's top
priority, Siew said, adding that political topics, however, should
not be ruled out. What is in dispute between the two sides are
differences in systems and ways of life, the premier said, adding
that the eventual reunification of the two sides will occur under the
principles of freedom, democracy and equal prosperity.</P>

(By Debbie Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Typhoon Ivan, which has been gaining
strength and approaching Taiwan, may pose a threat to the island
beginning Sunday, the Central Weather Bureau reported Friday.</P>
      <P>Ivan was upgraded to a "strong typhoon" at 3:00 p.m., when its
center was some 1,336 kilometers southeast of Taiwan's southernmost
tip of Hengchun. It had developed winds of 53 meters per second by
then.</P>
      <P>It is moving westerly toward Taiwan, the bureau said.</P>
      <P>Although the western Pacific usually sees few tropical storms in
autumn, Ivan could still bring the island damaging winds and rain, it
said.</P>
      <P>The bureau warned Taiwan residents to be particularly careful of
this and other "autumn typhoons," noting their arrival coincides with
the northeast monsoon season and that the combination can cause
torrential rains.</P>
      <P>The impact of autumn typhoons on the island doubles when they are
"fueled" by northeast monsoons, which significantly affect the
climate in the Taiwan area during the fall and winter, bureau
meteorologists said.</P>
      <P>Another autumn typhoon, Joan, meanwhile, was spotted some 2,000
kilometers south of Ivan and moving along the same course toward the

    <HEADLINE>NEW ROC ENVOY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT TIES WITH US</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 17 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>New Republic of China Representative to the
United States Stephen Chen said on Friday that he looks upon his new
assignment as a challenge and is optimistic about future bilateral
relations.</P>
      <P>Chen, who has previously served as a deputy secretary general to
President Lee Teng-hui and a vice minister of foreign affairs, as
well as spending four years in the US as a deputy ROC representative,
left for the US on Friday evening to assume his new post.</P>
      <P>He told the press prior to his departure that he will do his
utmost to reinforce ROC-US relations, based on the achievements of
his predecessors.</P>
      <P>Chen's first test will come in the first few days of his new job,
as mainland China's President Jiang Zemin is scheduled to arrive in
the US on Oct. 26 for a state visit and summit meeting with US
President Bill Clinton.</P>
      <P>Chen said American authorities have repeatedly assured the ROC
that they will not engage mainland China at the expense of Taipei.</P>
      <P>The seasoned career diplomat said the ROC's consistent hope is
that Taipei-Washington relations will develop parallel to
Washington-Beijing ties. "We don't think our relationship with the US
is part of the triangular Taipei-Washington-Beijing ties," he
stressed.</P>
      <P>Touching on his work plans, Chen said he will encourage all ROC
officials stationed in the US to work out innovative strategies to
help cement bilateral ties and expand cooperation in various fields.</P>
      <P>In addition to reinforcing contacts with the US executive branch
and Congress, Chen said he will also boost engagements with the
academic, commercial, industrial and religious communities, as well
as the major US think-tanks, media organizations and labor unions.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan's democratization is a major factor that has
prompted the US to sell defensive arms to and develop friendly,
substantive ties with Taiwan, Chen said he will strengthen contacts
and communications with the US media in order to help more ordinary
American citizens understand the ROC's efforts to promote democracy,
freedom and human rights.</P>
      <P>In the face of mainland China's incessant efforts to block and
squeeze Taiwan's presence in the international community, Chen said
he will uphold three principles: No retreat, no evasion and no
concessions.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Huang Kun-hui, secretary general to President
Lee Teng-hui, on Lee's behalf, conferred the Order of Propitious
Clouds to Chen in recognition of his contribution to the nation and
society during his service at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Chen, 63, will be the ROC's seventh representative to the US
since the two countries severed diplomatic ties in 1979.</P>
      <P>On Friday morning, Vice Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs
John Chang presided over Chen's swearing-in, lauding Chen as an
experienced, devoted and capable diplomat and adding that he is a
suitable person to serve as the ROC's de facto ambassador to the US.</P>
      <P>Chang also described current ROC-US relations as "strong, healthy
and stable," but added that there is still ample room for further
substantive growth in Taipei-Washington ties.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  17 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Share prices on the Taiwan stock exchange
continued to slide on Friday, with the weighted index, the key
barometer of the local bourse, dropping by 165.66 points to close at
7,832.15.</P>
      <P>The slide was the result of the recent persistent and heavy
decline in electronics issues since Thursday, which has posed a
serious threat to the government's currency defense policy.</P>
      <P>A total of 22.5 billion shares changed hands on a market turnover
of NT$13.71 billion (US$465 million). Losers outnumbered gainers 353
to 78, with 29 issues remaining unchanged.</P>
      <P>The 10 most-heavily traded issues were: Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing; United Micro Electronics; Macronix International;
China Steel; Mosel Vitelic Inc., A.S.E.; Acer; Winbond Electronics
Corp.; Walsin Lihwa; and Compal Electronic.</P>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew called on the public to focus on the
long-term development of the stock market. He expressed the belief
that the packages announced by the Central Bank of China (CBC) and
the Ministry of Finance Thursday will stimulate bullish behavior in
the local bourse.</P>
      <P>Siew made the remarks while answering questions from Kuomintang
Legislator Chen Hung-chang on the CBC's measures to stabilize the New
Taiwan dollar, which have provoked the continued plummet in the stock
market.</P>
      <P>Stressing that stabilizing the financial sector remains the
government's top priority, Siew said the government will respect
market mechanisms and will not intervene as long as the market
performance remains normal.</P>
      <P>He urged local stock market players, mostly individual investors,
to have confidence in the government's prop-up measures and not to be
influenced by speculation.</P>
      <P>CBC Governor Y.D. Sheu also stressed that Taiwan's financial
market is healthy and sound and that the local currency's exchange
rate against the US dollar remains reasonable. He said the CBC's

    <HEADLINE>LOCAL PRESS COMMENT ON GOVERNMENT'S DILEMMA ON MAINLAND POLICY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  17  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The following are excerpts from an
editorial carried in Friday's edition of local English-language daily
the China News.</P>
      <P>Direct Links Create Policy Dilemma</P>
      <P>As calls mount among Taiwan's high-powered business community to
establish official cross-strait links, the government and President
Lee Teng-hui have so far responded with nothing more than a shrug.</P>
      <P>But their failure to react in a substantive way should not be
seen as due to reticence or stubbornness. It is because they have no
other choice.</P>
      <P>The continuing ban on direct links is not just a government
administrative policy. It is mandated by a binding directive passed
in 1991 by the National Unification Council. Called the Guidelines
for National Unification, the directive limits developing ties with
(mainland) China to three very distinct phases, which are not meant
to overlap each other.</P>
      <P>The only way to legally initiate official cross-strait links is
to annul the Guidelines for National Unification, which would
essentially negate the sole reason for the existence of the National
Unification Council.</P>
      <P>This is obviously unacceptable to the government for a number of
reasons, the foremost of which is that it would be tantamount to an
admission of failure on the (mainland) China policy front. Such a
move would also be seen in Beijing as yet another move by the
president down his "splittist path." In addition, scrapping the
Guidelines would leave the government with no long-term strategy for
unification with (mainland) China...</P>
      <P>Creating direct transportation, communication, and commercial
links with (mainland) China is obviously a good idea, and indeed may
be something that President Lee himself believes in. The dilemma
isn't about whether he should, but rather whether he can afford to.</P>

      <P>Hormone treatment to give young women
"artificial pregnancies" by mirroring changes to the breasts normally
seen in expectant mothers may prevent breast cancer in high-risk
women, a prominent Australian medical specialist has said.</P>
      <P>Professor Allan Langlands of the Westmead Hospital in Sydney said
such an approach may also help counter the increased breast cancer
risk in women who delay childbirth.</P>
      <P>Recent studies in Denmark and Canada show that survival rates are
increased if radiotherapy is combined with chemotherapy after a
mastectomy in premenopausal women with a high risk of recurrence, he
said.</P>
      <P>But it is not yet routinely offered to high-risk women, as its
role in this group has previously been controversial, he noted.</P>
      <P>Langlands said radiotherapy's role in breast cancer treatment had
been undervalued and sidelined because of medical politics.</P>
      <P>"A person has no chance of getting radiotherapy if the surgeon
and medical oncologist don't offer it," he said.</P>
      <P>Other experts said many women were not receiving radiotherapy
after breast-conserving surgery despite long-standing recommendation
for its use.</P>
      <P>Langlands said Australian women were living in a breast cancer
society partly because of the trend towards delayed childbirth and
smaller families.</P>
      <P>These factors, coupled with delayed menopause, early onset of
puberty and less time breast feeding, were having a substantial
impact on the rising incidence of breast cancer, he said.</P>

      <P>Japan and Norway are likely to go their
own ways if Australia pushes them too hard to control whaling at the
international conference on whaling to be held in Monaco next week,
according to the International Whaling Commission (IWC).</P>
      <P>Dr. Ray Cambell of the commission told mass circulation newspaper
The Australian on Friday that Norway and Japan could "go off on their
own" and pull out of the IWC regime.</P>
      <P>The future of the world's whales is under the spotlight in the
tiny principality of Monaco, where officials from around the world
will meet to map out a new global management regime at the IWC's 49th
annual meeting.</P>
      <P>Australia is expected to play a key role in the tussle between
the whaling nations of Japan and Norway and more conservative-minded
countries.</P>
      <P>Australia's Environment Minister Robert Hill recently threatened
to ban whaling and would propose what would amount to a moratorium on
commercial whaling in the absence of enforceable international law.</P>
      <P>Whaling would be allowed only within the 12 nautical mile
territorial zone of each country and then only because it would be
difficult for the world community to prevent it.</P>

the oceans of the southern Hemisphere and only 550 humpbacks in the
western North Atlantic.</P>

    <DATELINE>Paris,   Oct.  16  (CNA)
(By Tzou Ming-jhie &amp; Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chairman Hsu Hsin-liang of Taiwan's
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said here on Thursday
that his party is willing to accept an offer by Beijing to hold
bilateral dialogue which he said should focus on peace and stability
across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Hsu, who flew to Paris from Germany on Tuesday for a three-day
visit, said that although the DPP will no longer openly propose
Taiwan independence to avoid increasing the cross-strait tension,
this doesn't necessarily mean that it has given up its call for
Taiwan's eventual independence.</P>
      <P>Sissy Chen, director of the DPP's Publicity Department, who
accompanied Hsu on the trip, said that the DPP is willing to shelve
the sensitive "sovereignty" issue and talk with Beijing on the
establishment of postal, trade and transportation links between
Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>She also suggested that the proposed talks be held within the
framework of the World Trade Organization (WTO), in which both Taiwan
and the mainland are seeking admission, so as to further reduce the
political sensitivity.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Beijing's recent change in attitude toward the DPP
immediately prior to a visit by mainland President Jiang Zemin to the
United States on Oct. 26, Hsu said that it is because Beijing is
trying to create a false impression in the international community
that it is seeking peace across the Taiwan Strait so as to ease US
concerns about the Taiwan issue. Beijing in the past has refused any
contact with the DPP because of its pro-independence stance.</P>
      <P>He described this as an indication that the Taiwan issue has
attracted great concern from the world, a sure sign of the island's
"internationalization."</P>
      <P>In related news in Taipei, a ranking official with the Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) said, however, that any negotiations with
Beijing should be conducted by the government or its authorized
agencies.</P>
      <P>Hsu Ke-sheng, MAC vice chairman, said that although the
government does not object to the opposition exchanging views with
Beijing, it's impossible for any opposition party to talk with
Beijing on the government's behalf.</P>
      <P>Hsu stressed that the government's top priority for the moment is
to resume the highest-level negotiations between the heads of
Taiwan's Strait Exchange Foundation (SEF) and the mainland's
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) -- the two
intermediary bodies authorized by both sides to handle cross-strait
exchanges in the absence of formal contacts.</P>
      <P>SEF Chairman C.F. Koo and ARATS Chairman Wang Daohan last met in
Singapore in April, 1993 for historic talks, but Beijing unilaterally
suspended a second round of talks scheduled for the summer of 1995,
following President Lee Teng-hui's visit to the United States, which
Beijing interpreted as a move to promote Taiwan independence.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INTERNATIONAL MEETING ON TUNA HELD HERE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Oct.  17  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A two-day international conference on
tuna fishing opened here on Friday, with the participation of more
than one hundred tuna experts from Taiwan, Japan, South Korea and
Indonesia, according to the cabinet-level Council of Agriculture
(COA).</P>
      <P>The meeting, the ninth of its kind, will focus on seeking
consensus on the management and development of the tuna fishing
industry, the COA said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, Japan, South Korea and Indonesia are the four major
tuna-fishing countries in Asia and the COA said all the four nations
are highly concerned about the industry's future in the face of
increased international restrictions on tuna fishing, in addition to
several other factors currently plaguing the industry, such as a
labor shortage, declining prices and pressure from global marine
protection agencies.</P>
      <P>Because of the likelihood of even greater pressure being exerted
on the industry, the Taiwan tuna fishing sector has adopted concerted
measures with neighboring countries to protect tuna resources and
stabilize supply and demand and prices in the international market,
the COA said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in response to international pressure on Taiwan to
reduce the size of its long-line fishing fleet in a bid to protect
fish stocks and maintain reasonable profits, the Taiwan Deep-Sea Tuna
Fishing Industry Association said it will gradually replace the older
tuna fishing boats among its more than 400 units, but insists on
maintaining the current number of its long-line vessels.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Negotiators from Taiwan and the United
States on Friday failed to reach agreement on the allocation of
import quotas for rice in the third day of the current round of
Taiwan-US trade talks on terms for Taiwan's admission to the World
Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>The US side proposed that the allocation of quotas be conducted
on a "first come, first served" basis, but Taiwan trade officials
insisted on applying a bidding system to import quotas.</P>
      <P>Taiwan agreed in earlier rounds of the trade talks that rice
imports will be up to 4 percent of its annual consumption in the
first year of WTO membership and that the percentage will increase
gradually to 8 percent within six years.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the officials also discussed the elimination of import
tariffs on a variety of industrial products. According to a plan
proposed by the Taiwan side, import tariffs on most general
industrial products will be reduced to zero by 2002. Another list of
564 items, including beer, whisky, brandy, construction materials and
medical items, will see tariffs eliminated by 2005, while import
tariffs on 139 "sensitive" items, including cars, plywood and paper
scrap will be reduced more gradually.</P>
      <P>However, the two sides failed to reach consensus on these issues,
with the US negotiators requesting that tariff reductions on the 564
items also be finalized by 2002 and that the list of 139 sensitive
items be reduced.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER  SAYS TIME NOT RIPE FOR DIRECT LINKS WITH MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  17  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The time is not ripe for opening direct
cross-strait links, ROC Premier Vincent Siew said on Friday.</P>
      <P>The premier told the legislature in an interpellation session
that the government does not, and should not, have a time-frame for
establishing direct transportation, communication and trade links
with mainland China, adding that only if Beijing gives up its
hostility toward Taipei, treats Taipei with due respect and
negotiates with Taipei in a sensitive manner, will there be any
possibility for these kinds of links.</P>
      <P>Addressing legislators' concerns about the government's response
to mounting calls from local business leaders for direct links with
mainland China, Siew reiterated the government's stance -- that
national security, dignity and the people's welfare should be taken
into account when discussing the issue and that the major obstacles
to this kind of contact are Beijing's refusal to accept Taiwan's
existence as a sovereign political entity and its attempts to squeeze
the island out of the international community.</P>
      <P>In Beijing's view, the premier said, there is no clear
distinction between politics and economics, which means that heavy
economic reliance on the mainland will lead to the loss of the
island's economic independence, which will threaten its security.</P>
      <P>No country in the world, not even the US, preaches free trade
without regard to its national security, said Siew, pointing out that
the US is one of the most vocal supporters of free trade.</P>
      <P>Commercial interests should not take precedence over political
interests, especially while Beijing has not renounced the use of
force against Taiwan. "We should be very cautious in our dealings
with Beijing," said Siew.</P>
      <P>Despite the lack of direct links, cross-strait trade is thriving
anyway, said Siew, who once served as the head of the Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC), the country's mainland China policy-making
body. He promised to review the government's mainland policy and
continue to weigh the possibility of negotiating with Beijing.</P>
      <P>In a related development, the MAC said on Friday that the current
policy toward the mainland of "be patient, no haste" will not change
so long as Beijing fails to renounce its military threat against the
island and does not accept Taiwan as an equal political entity.</P>
      <P>Sheu Ke-sheng, vice chairman of the MAC, told a weekly press
conference that the government's policy should juggle the interests
of individual enterprises as well as those of the nation.</P>
      <P>In a clear reference to one shipping tycoon's recent call for
direct cross-strait links, Sheu said that the industrialists are
entitled to air their personal opinions publicly, but the government
should take the whole nation's interests into account before
considering any change to the stated policy.</P>
      <P>In defense of the off-shore transshipment center, established by
the government to accommodate foreign ships sailing between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait as a substitute for direct shipping links,
Sheu said it has great potential and, if successful, will lead to the
creation of a special economic and trade zone which will serve as a
test-run for eventual direct shipping links with the mainland, said
Sheu.</P>

    <HEADLINE>`BE PATIENT, NO HASTE' POLICY CRITICALLY ESSENTIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  18 (CNA)
(By Debbie Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government's exhortations to Taiwan's
private sector to adhere to a policy of "be patient, no haste" in
developing business in mainland China seems to have been
misunderstood, an official involved with formulating Taipei's
mainland Chinese policies said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Disregarding other critical factors, Taiwan's heavy reliance on
economic and trade ties with the mainland alone can justify the
exercise of restraint in dealings with mainland China, said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.</P>
      <P>From a political point of view, he noted, Taiwan has no reason to
free up restrictions curbing direct links with the mainland when
Beijing still refuses to accept Taiwan's existence as a sovereign
political entity and continues its never-ending attempts to squeeze
the island out of the international community.</P>
      <P>He said political considerations definitely play a decisive role
in a nation's economic relations with any other area outside its
borders, citing the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
countries' economic boycott of Warsaw Pact members, the US-led
economic embargo against Beijing in the wake of the 1989 Tiananmen
Square massacre, and the US economic boycott of Cuba as examples.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Dr. Chen Po-chih, an economics professor at National
Taiwan University, urged the public to look at the figures to better
understand the gravity of Taiwan's "risky reliance" on the mainland.</P>
      <P>First, he said, Taiwan investments on the mainland have reached 2
percent of the island's GDP annually in recent years. That figure is
the second-highest in the world, second only to Hong Kong's. By
comparison, Japanese and American investments in mainland China stand
at only 0.2 percent of their GDP, respectively.</P>
      <P>Secondly, domestic investment takes up about 25 percent of
Taiwan's annual GDP, while savings constitutes about 27 percent. As a
result, the amount of money that Taiwan can safely spend on
investments overseas is only about 2 percent, the professor pointed
out.</P>
      <P>Thirdly, Taiwan's exports to mainland China reached 25 percent of
the island's entire export business in 1995, the highest proportion
in the world. South Korea, which has the second-biggest proportion of
exports going to the mainland, has a figure of only 16 percent, he
noted.</P>
      <P>Compared with most of the Southeast Asian countries, which put
aside about 35 percent of their GDPs for domestic investment,
Taiwan's home investment has been relatively low, he said.</P>
      <P>Even more worrisome is that most of the out-bound Taiwan
investment has been channeled into a single site -- mainland China.
If the trend continues, he added, Taiwan's economic competitiveness
in the world will surely be compromised to a grave level.</P>

    <HEADLINE>APEC URGED TO SET UP ASIA-PACIFIC FUND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,   Oct.  17  (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Economists from 13 Asia-Pacific
countries have suggested that the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) forum set up an Asia-Pacific fund to ward off any possible
financial crisis.</P>
      <P>Fred Bergsten, a former head of APEC's Eminent Persons Group,
said he and 12 other economists sent a joint letter to Canadian Prime
Minister Jean Chretien in August pressing for the establishment of an
international relief mechanism to maintain regional financial
stability.</P>
      <P>Bergsten, who now heads the International Economics Research
Institute, a Washington-based think-tank, said the recent financial
turmoil in Southeast Asia has caused much concern in the world
financial community, prompting fears of a recurrence of the financial
fiasco in Mexico a few years ago.</P>
      <P>Bergsten said the letter didn't suggest how much money the
proposed Asia-Pacific fund should have. "We think the amount should
range between US$50 billion and US$100 billion," he said, adding that
the larger the sum, the more effective it will be.</P>
      <P>The Canadian government, which will host this year's APEC
conferences, has not yet made a formal response to the proposal.</P>
      <P>Bergsten said the realization of the proposal will require the
full support of all the major Asia-Pacific countries, including
Japan, the United States and Canada.</P>
      <P>He said as the International Monetary Fund has limited resources
to offer emergency loans to individual countries to help them stem a
financial crisis, Asia-Pacific countries should establish a hedge
fund in their own right to ensure their financial stability.</P>
      <P>The proposal is expected to be discussed at the 1997 annual APEC
ministerial-level conference and informal leadership meeting to be
held in Vancouver in November.</P>
      <P>APEC groups 18 economies, including Australia, Brunei, Canada,
Chile, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, mainland China, Malaysia, Mexico,
New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea,
Taiwan, Thailand and the United States.</P>

    <DATELINE>Paris,  Oct.  17  (CNA)
(By M.J. Zhou and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Hsu Hsin-liang, chairman of Taiwan's main
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), said on Friday that
party-to-party contacts are most akin to government-to-government
contacts and that he will continue to push for party diplomacy in the
future.</P>
      <P>Hsu made the remarks at the conclusion of a four-day visit to
France which followed his attendance of an annual conference in
Berlin of top leaders from democratic parties in major countries
around the world.</P>
      <P>His visits to the two European countries focused on observing the
social welfare and education systems in those nations. During his
French visit, he called at the headquarters of France's Socialist
Party and visited several social, foreign and educational
departments, as well as large French enterprises such as Dassault and
Matra. Hsu's 15-member delegation also visited kindergarten education
and children's protection institutions under the Paris city
government.</P>
      <P>Noting that French foreign officials said Taiwan should be
encouraged in its push for pragmatic diplomacy to gain a greater
profile in international community, Hsu said that France is happy to
develop trade, technology, cultural and educational cooperation
with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>But he added that the officials also said that if Taiwan insists
on developing formal diplomatic relations, France is afraid it will
trigger a drastic reaction from mainland China, in which case, Taiwan
cannot expect an advance, but may even see relations with France
backpedal.</P>
      <P>Describing this opinion as direct, Hsu said that most governments
and peoples in Europe are friendly towards Taiwan and that if they
did not have to worry about reactions from Beijing, they would
already have accepted Taiwan as a full member of the international
community in line with universally accepted norms.</P>
      <P>In view of this situation, Hsu said that if Taiwan is to gain
international support for its cause, it will have to increase
contacts with the private sectors of other nations and step up
international promotional campaigns.</P>
      <P>He also said that Taiwan will have to consider the consequences
of pushing for diplomatic activities and that it should avoid
diplomatic confrontation that would be detrimental to Taiwan's
security.</P>
      <P>He stressed that both the DPP and the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) are
unanimous on major issues such as foreign relations and security in
the Taiwan Strait that are crucial to Taiwan's best interests.</P>

      <P>Gyado Thondup, brother of the exiled

Secretariat of the Dalai Lama will send officials to Taiwan in
mid-November to establish a Buddhist foundation.</P>
      <P>Thondup said that the non-profit foundation will help strengthen

Tibet.</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama's roving ambassador, who led a Tibetan delegation
which attended the ROC's National Day celebrations on Oct. 10, made
the remarks at press conference sponsored by the Mongolian and
Tibetan Affairs Commission.</P>
      <P>The foundation's inauguration comes after months of coordination
between the Buddhist Association here and the Dalai Lama's London
Office, he said, adding that it was first initiated by the Dalai Lama
after his visit to Taiwan on March 22-27 this year, when he decided
that religious and cultural exchanges between Tibet and Taiwan should
be enhanced.</P>
      <P>Thondup said that those who will come to Taiwan to help establish
the foundation will include one official from the London office of
the Tibetan government-in-exile and another from the Dalai Lama's
Secretariat who is fluent in Mandarin Chinese.</P>
      <P>Kao Koong-lian, chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs

assistance for Tibetans in India who contract tuberculosis, a common
complaint among those who flee from the high-altitude Tibetan plateau
to the lowland Indian plains because of repression and persecution by
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Kao also said the commission will help Tibetan students who wish

    <TEXT>
      <P>Warning that cross-strait trade with
mainland China is booming again, a ruling party-organized think-tank
urged the government to minimize the possible risks caused by
overheating commercial activities with the mainland.</P>
      <P>The Kuomintang (KMT) Mainland Studies Department pointed out in
its official bi-weekly report that Beijing has followed calls made at
the Chinese Communist Party's 15th National Congress for beefing up
trade with Taiwan, using measures to attract Taiwan businessmen such
as opening more sectors for Taiwan investment, raising the ratio of
local sales to the total production by Taiwan-financed firms and
lowering tariffs on raw materials imported by Taiwan investors.</P>
      <P>As a result, the department said it anticipates another fever of
mainland investment among the Taiwan business community which will
bring mixed consequences for Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>Although the thriving cross-strait trade could -- in the short
term -- relieve Taiwan's heavy reliance on the US market, find an
outlet for Taiwan's excessive capital and relocate the island's
out-of-date industries to mainland China, thus upgrading the
industries which remain, it would -- in the long term -- "hollow out"
local industry, block the advancement of the island's industry, delay
the achievement of Taiwan's goal of being a science\technology
center, increase Taiwan's economic reliance on mainland China and
thus give Beijing leverage to influence the island's politics,
according to the report.</P>
      <P>In order to avoid this unfavorable scenario, the department
called on the government to carefully regulate the island's
investment outflow to the mainland and cushion its negative impact on
Taiwan's economy.</P>

      <P>Although it has lost its value by 6.81
percent so far this year, the New Taiwan dollar is still one of the
least-devalued currencies of the four Asian newly-developed
industrial countries, or "Asian tigers" said a senior official of the
Central Bank of China (CBC) on Friday.</P>
      <P>Compared with the South Korean won's devaluation of 7.65 percent
and the 9.64 percent drop in the Singapore dollar, the NT dollar is
the most steady among the four Asian tigers, with the exception of
Hong Kong, which pegs its currency to the US dollar, said Liang
Cheng-chin, deputy governor of the CBC, at a press conference.</P>
      <P>In an attempt to calm panic on the financial market after the NT
dollar took a plunge of 3.46 percent on Friday to 29.5 against the US
greenback, Liang said the CBC gave up its defense of the value of NT
dollar because of the significant changes on international financial
markets, from which the Taiwan foreign exchange market cannot be
excluded.</P>
      <P>The CBC let the NT dollar drift on the market after having pumped
more than US$5 billion into the market in two weeks in a desperate
attempt to defend its value.</P>
      <P>In response to criticism of the CBC's perceived policy flip-flop
Liang urged the critics to save their breath until the impact of the
CBC's measures takes effect.</P>
      <P>As to the CBC's decision to lower reserve requirements for
commercial banks twice in a single month, Hsu Chia-tung, another CBC
deputy governor, said the moves were aimed at replenishing the market

    <TEXT>
      <P>Both Justice Minister Liao Cheng-hao and
Interior Minister Yeh Chin-feng emphasized on Saturday that harsher
penalties will help stop the rise in the number of gun-related crimes
on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Liao said illegal firearms are posing an increasing threat to
Taiwan's social order and that a crackdown on guns is now one of his
top priorities.</P>
      <P>Liao and Yeh spoke at the Legislative Yuan Saturday morning
before a joint-committee plenary session. Shortly after their talk,
the legislature passed revised firearms control statutes with
unexpected speed.</P>
      <P>The revised statutes stipulate that anyone who manufactures,
sells or transports firearms, including guns and bombs, could face
the death penalty plus a fine of up to NT$30 million (US$1.03
million).</P>
      <P>Those who attempt to provide themselves or others with firearms
to commit a crime could also face capital punishment and a fine of up
to NT$50 million (US$1.72 million).</P>
      <P>Anyone who -- without official authority -- modifies model or
simulated guns into real firearms, or promotes and transports such

    <HEADLINE>LEE CALLS FOR EARLY ESTABLISHMENT OF REGIONAL SECURITY MECHANISM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taichung,  Oct.  18  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui on Saturday
appealed for the early establishment of a regional security mechanism
to maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and the entire
Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening session of the ninth Asia Outlook seminar
in the central Taiwan city of Taichung, Lee also expressed his hope
that various forms of dialogue helpful to regional security will
continue in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>Lee said although mainland China's economic development has drawn
much attention, its political reforms have made little progress.
"Beijing's refusal to forsake its communist system and its incessant
military buildups are major threats to regional security," the
president pointed out.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, Lee said, the Republic of China on Taiwan has
become a full-fledged democracy following its first direct
presidential election in March 1996. "The sharp contrast between the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait is an issue worthy of scrutiny when
studying political development in East Asia," he said.</P>
      <P>Although the world situation has gradually eased following the
end of the Cold War, Lee said some disruptive factors still exist in
East Asia, most notably the potential flash points of the Korean
peninsula, the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea.</P>
      <P>The president said, however, that one encouraging development is
the fact that frosty cross-strait relations are gradually warming up
through the ROC's constant calls for peace and its adoption of
concrete goodwill measures.</P>
      <P>"It is our earnest hope that constructive dialogue will be
continued and a collective security system will be established in the
near future to safeguard peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and
the West Pacific," Lee noted.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that the Asia-Pacific security alliance has
entered a new stage following the signing of new guidelines for
defense cooperation between Japan and the United States in
September. "We welcome this development as it is expected to have a
positive impact on regional security and peace.</P>
      <P>Lee also urged Japan to play a more active role in spurring
regional economic development. "Except for Japan, most East Asian
economies lack capital and technology," he said, adding: "Japan
should use its economic leverage to assist other East Asian countries
in upgrading their industrial and technological levels."</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, C.F. Koo, leader of the ROC
delegation to the seminar, said mainland China's development is the
most critical variable in forecasting the future of East Asia.</P>
      <P>Koo, a veteran business tycoon who also serves as Taiwan's top
negotiator with mainland China, said he hopes communist Chinese
leaders will honor their promise not to develop a military hegemony.</P>
      <P>"It will contribute much to regional stability and prosperity if
mainland China, following its recent economic reforms, can gradually
develop a checks-and-balances power mechanism and ensure transparency
in its policy-making process," noted Koo, who is also a senior
adviser to President Lee.</P>
      <P>Masao Kamei, a senior adviser to Sumitomo Electric Industries and
leader of the 50-member Japanese delegation to the seminar, said the
world is watching whether mainland China can honor its promise to
maintain Hong Kong's capitalist system and lifestyle for 50 years
following its takeover of the former British colony on July 1, 1997.
"Mainland China's policy will determine whether Hong Kong can
continue serving as a financial center and transshipment hub in
Asia," he said.</P>
      <P>Shirley Kuo, a former ROC finance minister and now minister
without portfolio, said all Asia-Pacific countries should adopt a
"soft" financial policy to facilitate the free flow of capital and
boost regional economic development.</P>
      <P>Addressing a lunch meeting, Premier Vincent Siew told all
participants that Taiwan is located on an economic strategic point
and stands a good chance to become an Asia-Pacific regional
operations center and help nurture a new Asia-Pacific culture.</P>
      <P>More than 150 international affairs experts, academics,
business leaders and parliamentarians from Taiwan and Japan are
taking part in the annual two-day seminar.</P>
      <P>The Asia Outlook Forum, founded in 1989, is aimed at pooling the
wisdom of the elite members of business, political and academic
communities in Taiwan and Japan to help boost bilateral
substantive ties as well as regional prosperity and stability. The
forum holds its annual meeting alternately in Taiwan and Japan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US THINK-TANK URGES US TO MEDIATE ACROSS TAIWAN STRAIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  Oct.  18  (CNA)
(By Mike Chang and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A US think-tank has suggested that the US
government mediate between Taiwan and mainland China to help forge a
new relationship between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, a
leading Japanese paper reported here on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Sankei Shimbun, in a dispatch from Washington, D.C., said that
the Progressive Policy Institute (PPI), a Washington, D.C.-based
think-tank, noted in a recent report that if relations between Taiwan
and mainland China remain stalled, it will become an uncertain factor
in Asia and will affect relations between Washington and Beijing.</P>
      <P>The think-tank therefore suggested that the US government act to
mediate between the two sides on the premise that Taiwan will forego
complete independence and in exchange, mainland China will recognize
Taiwan as an independent political entity and allow it to join the
United Nations.</P>
      <P>The think-tank also said that Taiwan has clearly rejected
mainland China's "one country, two systems" formula, while Beijing's
misgivings over Taiwan's alleged moves toward independence have also
deepened. This is making the situation uncertain and might even be
the cause of a potential flashpoint, threatening the overall
situation in Asian stability and relations between the US and
mainland China.</P>
      <P>The PPI said that the Shanghai Communique signed in 1972 between
Washington and Beijing, which deferred the question of Taiwan's
ultimate stance indefinitely, and the Taiwan Relations Act signed in
1979 between Washington and Taipei, can no longer meet the needs
of the current political situation. It is necessary for the US to
forge new agreements with both sides of the Taiwan Strait, it
suggested.</P>
      <P>The PPI urged the US to induce Beijing to renounce its threat to
use force against Taiwan, while persuading Taiwan not to announce
independence. Under this premise, mainland China will recognize that
Taiwan is an independent political entity under a tentative "one
China" principle and will not oppose it joining the United Nations
and related organizations.</P>
      <P>In turn, Taiwan should work toward national unification under
mutually agreed conditions form a long-term perspective, the PPI
suggested.</P>
      <P>The Shanghai Communique paved the way for then-US President
Richard Nixon to visit mainland China and the eventual establishment
of bilateral ties between Washington and Beijing, while the Taiwan
Relations Act stipulates that the US should supply Taiwan with
defensive weapons.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A nineteenth century French cemetery in
Keelung, northern Taiwan, will be open to the public beginning Oct.
23, Keelung officials said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The French Institute in Taiwan is turning the administration of
the cemetery, which is the final resting place of some 700 French
soldiers who were killed in Taiwan in the 1884 war between France and
China, over to the city.</P>
      <P>Some one square kilometer in size, the graveyard was established
in 1885 and features a monument erected in honor of the French dead.
Most of the names of those buried in the cemetery are no longer

      <P>In 1884, during the Ching Dynasty, China went to war with France
over French actions in Annam (current-day Vietnam), then a Chinese
protectorate.</P>
      <P>During the war, a French fleet attacked Taiwan and attempted to
land on the island but lost many men in a battle with Ching troops.
The French dead from that battle were laid to rest in the cemetery

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN MAY OPEN OSTRICH FARMING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 18 (CNA)
(By Debbie Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ostrich farming may be legally permitted in
Taiwan soon after Taiwan's domestic investors gain sufficient
know-how of this trade, the Council of Agriculture (COA) said on
Saturday.</P>
      <P>The government, however, will not lift the ban on live ostrich
imports until potential investors thoroughly know the economic value
of the artificially-bred ostrich, its market potential and the
technology and management related to raising the birds, COA officials
noted.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has allowed imports of ostrich meat from the United States
since early last year.</P>
      <P>Since "ostrich fever" swept the island late last summer, some
importers have been in contact with foreign suppliers, mostly in the
United States and South Africa, over bringing live, artificially-bred
ostriches into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Such imports, however, are not yet legal -- on the grounds that
investors here still have little knowledge about this trade, the
officials said.</P>
      <P>To help the public gain more understanding of ostriches, the COA
has contracted Professor Hsu Chen-chung of National Chunghsing
University in Taichung to conduct a field trip to South Africa and
Namibia to familiarize himself with ostrich farming and breeding
technology.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING WILL NOT COMPLICATE MARINE POLICE CASE: ARATS OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 18 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China is studying the best way to
handle the case of abducted marine policeman Chuang Chen-yao and will
inform Taiwan once a decision has been reached, an official of the
Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait
(ARATS) said here on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Zhang Shenglin, director of the ARATS Coordination Department who
arrived here on Thursday to attend an award ceremony for a children's
painting contest, said mainland authorities have no intention of
further complicating the case.</P>
      <P>Chuang, a Taiwan marine police officer, was abducted to the
Fujian province port city of Fuzhou by mainland fishermen last Sunday
while performing a search of a mainland fishing vessel caught
operating illegally in Taiwan's territorial waters.</P>
      <P>Professing a lack of knowledge of the details of the case, Zhang
said she doesn't know how the mainland authorities will handle the
issue, but pointed out that ARATS maintains regular contacts with its
Taiwan counterpart, the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), and will
inform it of any new developments.</P>
      <P>Zhang said that as far as she knows, Chuang will be repatriated
after mainland authorities have completed their investigation and
after some related formalities have been taken care of.</P>
      <P>She also said that the mainland authorities are well aware that
Taiwan is very concerned about the outcome of the case.</P>
      <P>According to Taiwan's initial investigation, Chuang was abducted
when two Taiwan marine police patrol boats intercepted and boarded a
mainland fishing vessel which had intruded into waters off the
island of Matsu, which is controlled by Taiwan but located close to
the mainland. Nine policemen who boarded the mainland fishing boat
Ming Chang Yu 1448 were attacked by the mainland crew armed with
knives, axes and bottles.</P>
      <P>However, mainland authorities have a different account of the
incident. The ARATS said in a letter sent to the SEF earlier this
week that the mainland crew had accused Taiwan marine police of
shooting at them while their boat was returning home and made no
"suspicious" moves when intercepted and boarded by the police.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chairman Chang King-yuh of the Mainland Affairs
Council, which charts Taiwan's policy toward the mainland, said the
government will explain the truth to mainland authorities through
the SEF.</P>
      <P>Chang said both sides of the Taiwan Strait should deal with the
case strictly based on facts. "Only by so doing can the two sides
develop peaceful, stable relations," he added.</P>
      <P>In addition to the marine police case, Cahng said, there also
are many cross-strait fishing disputes. "We hope the ARATS will
resume consultations with the SEF as soon as possible on
non-political administrative and technical issues arising from
increasing civilian cross-strait exchanges."</P>
      <P>Mainland China unilaterally suspended cross-strait dialogue
after ROC President Lee Teng-hui made a landmark private visit to
the United States in June 1995, which Beijing interpreted as a
veiled move to promote Taiwan independence.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's national currency plunged again
on Saturday to close at NT$29.76 against the US dollar amid
expectations of further devaluation of the local currency.</P>
      <P>The New Taiwan dollar lost NT$0.26 from Friday's finish of
NT$29.5.</P>
      <P>Saturday's finish was the lowest since November 1987. The local
currency shed a total of NT$1.242 over the past two days, partly
because the Central Bank of China (CBC) gave up its defense of the NT
dollar's value.</P>
      <P>The NT dollar opened weak at 29.65 against the greenback, and
then fluctuated between 29.61 and 29.85 during the three-hour trading
session.</P>

      <P>CBC Governor Sheu Yuan-dong said on Friday the central bank
would "let market force determine the NT dollar's exchange rate"

      <P>The Taiwan Stock Exchange (Taiex) tumbled
again on Saturday as investor confidence was dampened by persistent
drops on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).</P>
      <P>The weighted Taiex index, the key baromter of the local bourse,
shed 213.7 points, or 2.8 percent, to close at 7,618.45, the lowest
in seven months. The loss followed a 165.66-point slide on Friday.</P>
      <P>Market analysts attributed the substantial fall mainly to a loss
of investor confidence in the electronics stocks, which have
remained weak in recent days.</P>

fall in three years.</P>
      <P>Financial experts said the room for local share prices to fall

    <HEADLINE>JAPANESE CARS: TOO MANY MODELS, TOO FEW BUYERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  Oct.  17  (CNA)
(By David Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Japanese auto dealers have tried just
about everything to revive sales, but with Japan's economy on the
skids, potential buyers aren't buying, BusinessWeek reported in its
issue of Oct. 20.</P>
      <P>In a special report entitled "Too Many Cars, Too Few Buyers,"
BusinessWeek said that despite a flurry of new launches, the April
increase in Japan's consumption tax to 5 percent from 3 percent has
caused car sales to decline for six months in a row.</P>
      <P>Dealers sold 9 percent fewer cars in September than in the same
month last year and several have now fallen into the red or gone
bankrupt, it added.</P>
      <P>So carmakers are desperately hoping their 1998 models will boost
sales, the magazine said. The new lines of the Tokyo Motor Show in
late October have the latest brake, engine, and transmission
technology, more sporty designs and more environmentally friendly
engines -- including a "hybrid" car that runs on a combination of
gasoline and electricity.</P>
      <P>But Japanese consumers are already overwhelmed with choices,
BusinessWeek said. "There are over 190 car models available in the
market," says Atsushi Fujii, member of the board of directors in
charge of domestic sales at Nissan Motor Co. "And the average
consumer can only remember about 11 of them."</P>
      <P>Yet at the Motor Show, Japanese carmakers will be coming out with
even more, according to BusinessWeek. Toyota wants to target young
people with fun, European-looking models are a convertible sports
car. It also plans to roll out the world's first mass-produced
hybrid, with sales projected at 1,000 a month. Nissan, expected to
unveil its own hybrid next year, will fight back with a 3-liter
direct injection gasoline engine in its new Leopard luxury car. And
Honda Motor Co. has already launched a hybrid counterattack with its
own 1-liter, three-cylinder hybrid engine introduced in September.</P>
      <P>"The competition in recreational vehicles is going to intensify,"
Enda Clarke, automotive analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson (Asia),
says. And that's not the only place. With too many models chasing too
few buyers, only the snazziest of cars will sell, he adds.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EUROPEAN MEDIA REPORT LESS ON ASIA THAN ASIAN MEDIA ON EUROPE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Oct.  18  (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>European media do substantially less
reporting about events in Asia than Asian media do about events in
Europe, according to a new study commissioned by the Singapore-based
Asia-Europe Foundation (Asef).</P>
      <P>The four-month study, carried out by the Asian Media Information
and Communication Center (Amic), examined how 15 Asian and 15
European newspapers and magazines reported events in the other region
over a 10-day period from June 27 to July 6.</P>
      <P>The period was deliberately chosen as it covered a major world
news event for the year -- the handover of Hong Kong from Britain to
mainland China on July 1.</P>
      <P>Besides the main finding that the media in Asia carried more news
on Europe than vice versa, the study showed that coverage of European
events by Asian publications was more extensive.</P>
      <P>Of the total of 3,725 news items studied, the European media
carried only 749 reports on Asian events, despite a world event like
the Hong Kong handover.</P>
      <P>Another interesting finding was that while Asian publications
generally tended to be neutral in their reporting of European events,
there were more instances of negative reports about Asian events in
the European media.</P>
      <P>One explanation for this is the reliance of Asian publications on
Western agencies, such as Reuters and Agence France Presse (AFP), for
their coverage of Europe. Such agency reports tend to be neutral.</P>
      <P>But more than half of the stories in the European media were
obtained from their own correspondents and tended to be more
opinionated and carry more personal viewpoints.</P>
      <P>The study also found that Asian publications concentrated on
Europe's sports and recreation stories, followed by economic,
financial and business stories.</P>
      <P>European publications, however, focused primarily on economic,
business and finance stories about Asia.</P>
      <P>Asef was established by members of the Asia-Europe Meeting (Asem)
in February this year with the aim of engaging the civil societies of
the two regions.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the two regions' lopsided treatment of news about
each other, Asef executive director Professor Tommy Koh said Friday:
"The survey findings coincide with the historical perspective of
Asian countries, which feel that Europe is important to them. But 10
years from now, there will be more balanced reporting by the two
regions of each other."</P>
      <P>The study will provide the focus for a dialogue on media
understanding and cooperation by 40 editors from the two regions in
Luxembourg next week, according to The Straits Times.</P>
      <P>The meeting will examine the role of the media in promoting
better understanding between the peoples of Asia and Europe.</P>
      <P>Some of the other findings of the study:</P>
      <P>-- European news that received prominence in Asia were the
Wimbledon tennis tournament, the British royal family, the Mir
space-station accident and expansion plans for the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization.</P>
      <P>-- Asian events that were well reported in European publications
were the Hong Kong handover, Taiwan issue, beheading of a Japanese
boy by a youngster, devaluation of the Thai baht and the Cambodian
political crisis.</P>
      <P>-- Few or no examples of a comprehensive Asian perspective were
found in the European publications studied.</P>
      <P>-- Asian publications had most of their European stories filed
from London. European publications received most of their Asian
stories from Hong Kong.</P>

      <P>Reuters news agency is the main source
of news for Asian publications that report on European events,
according to a study by the Singapore-based Asia-Europe Foundation.</P>
      <P>The number of stories from Europe by Asian news agencies such as
Kyodo, Jiji Press, Xinhua news agency, Press Trust of India and
Bernama (the Malaysian news agency) is relatively small, the study
showed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the study also showed that Russian President Boris
Yeltsin barely pipped the world's top woman tennis player Martina
Hingis as the European personality most often mentioned in Asian
publications.</P>
      <P>Yeltsin was mentioned 33 times during the period covered by the
survey -- from June 27 to July 6 -- on how the Asian and European
media reported events and developments in the other region.</P>
      <P>Apart from these, former Albanian President Sali Berisha and
British Premier Tony Blair also received their fair share of
publicity in Asia.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, the top personality in Asia most frequently
mentioned is hardly Asian at all -- former Hong Kong Governor Chris
Patten.</P>
      <P>He was followed by mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin and
Hong Kong's chief executive Tung Chee Hwa.</P>
      <P>The fact that these three topped the list is not surprising,
considering that the Hong Kong handover was one of the top events in
Asia for the year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INCREASED M'LAND UNEMPLOYMENT SEEN AS THREAT TO GROWTH, STABILITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct.  18  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The surge in unemployment in mainland
China's industrial heartlands is emerging as a dangerous threat to
the economic growth and social stability in mainland China as the
government there prepares to launch belated reforms of its "backbone"
industries, according to The Sydney Morning Herald.</P>
      <P>In a dispatch from Beijing, the daily's correspondent David Lague
reported Saturday that the mainland Chinese government is "unable to
nourish its sprawling and hopelessly inefficient state-owned sector."</P>
      <P>The factories in Heilongjiang Province are starved of funds and
millions of workers are unemployment or unpaid, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>"They are all waiting for someone to feed them. In the past, the
government could be relied on to supply food, but in the future it
won't," a mainland businessman told the daily.</P>
      <P>The daily said the industries which were once the backbone of
mainland China's planned economy have been left languishing since
market reforms began in the late 1970s.</P>
      <P>About 100 million people were employed in more than 300,000
state-owned enterprises in mainland China, but Beijing has no choice
but to cut many of them loose or risk drowning the entire economy in
an ocean of red ink, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>Many of these debt-ridden enterprises had already collapsed
before the central authorities announced they would tackle
state-sector reforms at last month's 15th Party Congress in Beijing,
according to the Herald.</P>
      <P>Estimates of the total number of urban unemployed or unpaid vary
widely, but most analysts believe tens of millions of industrial jobs
have disappeared and that this problem is certain to get worse, the
daily reported.</P>
      <P>The vice governor of Heilongjiang recently told the official
China Daily newspaper that his province's state-owned industries had
once employed more than eight million workers but that now 20 percent
of these are unemployed and 30 percent of the remainder are
under-employed.</P>
      <P>But the Herald quoted a taxi driver in Heilongjiang's capital of
Harbin as saying that the official estimates were conservative.
"About 80 percent of workers from state-owned industries are
unemployed or unpaid," the driver said.</P>
      <P>"Almost every family has someone who has been laid off. I don't
know how people survive," he said.</P>
      <P>The Australian daily reported there were no obvious signs of
unrest or tension in Harbin this week as people enjoyed the few
remaining warm days before the onset of the traditionally cruel
winter but that an oppressive security presence is a signal the
authorities are taking no chances. On every street there were
security police or the paramilitary People's Armed Police and
plain-clothes officers mingling with the crowds, locals told the
daily.</P>
      <P>There have been reports of worker delegations protesting at
factory offices and local government buildings, but the driver said
local people had so far been giving the government time to solve the
problem.</P>
      <P>"Northeast people are famous for their passive attitude, but this
won't last long. People can't live like this," he said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  18  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Chinese Petroleum Company (CPC) will
not adjust the prices of gasoline and other oil products in the near
future, although the cost of oil imports has increased substantially
due to sharp devaluation of the New Taiwan dollar in recent days.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the state-run oil company said Saturday that CPC
depends on imports for most of its oil supply. Its import cost will
increase NT$6,000 million (US$200.3 million) per year, if the US
dollar surges one New Taiwan dollar in the foreign exchange market.</P>
      <P>The US dollar has surged NT$1.242 in the past two days in the
Taiwan foreign exchange market to close at NT$29.76 Saturday. The
sharp devaluation of the Taiwan currency has generated a heavy
pressure on the CPC to increase the prices of gasoline and other oil
products, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>However, the CPC is able to absorb the extra cost of oil imports
for the time being, because the company had a surplus in the first
three months of this fiscal year, he added. (by Ed Hsieh)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Hong Kong will lose about 90 percent of
its transshipment cargo if Taiwan and mainland China open direct
trade, the cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) said on Sunday.</P>
      <P>The CEPD, citing a report made by the Hong Kong Economic Research
Center, said that the port city of Kaohsiung in southern Taiwan, with
comparative advantages over several mainland Chinese ports, will be
the biggest threat to Hong Kong's position as the region's major
transshipment hub.</P>
      <P>The CEPD also pointed out that Hong Kong will lose about 90
percent of the transshipment business across the Taiwan Strait if
Taiwan and mainland China are allowed to conduct direct trade.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong currently is the largest cross-strait entrepot in the
absence of direct trade between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Although mainland Chinese ports such as Shanghai, Ningpo,
Yientien, and Sheke have been re-emerging in recent years, the CEPD
said Kaohsiung poses the biggest threat to Hong Kong in vying for
transshipment cargo in the region due to its central location in
Southeast Asia and its advanced world-class facilities.</P>
      <P>However, Kaohsiung is less competitive than Hong Kong due to red
tape and the lack of direct trade with the mainland, the CEPD noted.</P>

Saturday morning with over 100 members of the Chinese community,
Chairman of the American Institute in Taiwan Richard Bush and other

    <TEXT>
      <P>Canada's Prime Minister Jean Chretien
arrived in Moscow on Sunday and spent most of the day at Russian
President Boris Yeltsin's hunting lodge outside the city.</P>
      <P>The two leaders are expected to discuss, among other things, the
global ban on land mines. Canada hopes Russia will sign a Canada-led
international treaty banning the use of anti-personnel land mines in
December.</P>
      <P>It is Chretien's first state visit to Russia. "This visit is
overall ... a political visit," said a senior Canadian government
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.</P>
      <P>"However, when you look at the essence of our relations, a good
part of it is to build up our economic relationship, our business
relationship," the official noted.</P>
      <P>Russia is recognized as one of the world's major developing
marketplaces and Canadian companies are well established there in
such sectors as mining, oil and gas production and environmental
services.</P>
      <P>But Russia is a difficult -- and sometimes dangerous -- place to
do business. Organized crime has flourished since the fall of the
Communist order. And foreign investors cannot count on the
authorities to enforce the rules.</P>
      <P>One of the biggest Canadian investors in Russia, the IMP Group of
Halifax, has endured a campaign of police intimidation and official
harassment since it rejected its Russian partners' bid to buy out its
share of the Aerostar Hotel in Moscow.</P>
      <P>When the company tried to collect C$4.9 million in damages
awarded by Russia's Supreme Court recently, the Russian
prosecutor-general blocked the enforcement of the decision.</P>
      <P>The Canadian Embassy in Moscow has even had to step in to ensure
the safety of company officials when they visit Moscow.</P>
      <P>Chretien will ask Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin to
try to find ways to deal with the Aerostar problem when they meet on
Monday.</P>
      <P>On Monday, Chretien will also meet with Canadian businessmen in
Russia. Canadian investment in Russia totals about C$400 million, and
the parties are looking to boost that figure. Bilateral trade was
nearly double that amount in 1996.</P>
      <P>Chretien's European trip will last 10 days, as he moves on to
London and finally Edinburgh for a meeting of Commonwealth leaders.</P>

(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Communist China's hint this week that it
may be ready to cut some of its highest tariffs in order to gain
entry to the World Trade Organization (WTO) is a welcome sign that it
is finally waking up to the requirements of WTO membership.</P>
      <P>But Sir Leon Brittan, European Union (EU) trade commissioner, was
overly optimistic in calling the move a breakthrough which could
usher in the last lap of Communist China's decade-old accession
talks. More likely, that process "is just nearing the end of the
beginning," according to an European newspaper.</P>
      <P>The Financial Times said in an editorial that progress has been
long stalled by Communist China's high-handed insistence that WTO
membership was a political status symbol, to which it was entitled by
right. Only recently does Beijing seem to have grasped that the
organization is based on detailed and forcible rules and disciplines.
However, formidable resistance from domestic lobbies continues to
thwart efforts to open market wider.</P>
      <P>Beijing deserves some sympathy. The West is pressing it for
bigger concessions on WTO entry than most poorer members have been
required to make. Not only do the United States and the EU want
Communist China to cut average tariffs below those found in most
developing countries; many of their demands, notably in services,
extend far beyond the barriers of national borders into sensitive
areas of domestic policy.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, Communist China's willingness to liberalize still
falls far short of what is needed. Joining the WTO without pledging
to lower its trade barriers would frustrate the central purpose of
the exercise -- speeding the country's integration into the global
economy. It could also deprive Communist China of a principal
membership benefit by giving the United States and the EU political
arguments for refusing to guarantee it non-discriminatory trade
treatment after entry.</P>
      <P>A still larger concern centers on Communist China's readiness to
respect WTO rules. Unless it does so, its liberalization pledges will
be worthless, and its membership disruptive. However, sincere
Beijing's commitments, its capacity to deliver is unclear. Communist
China's domestic market is far from unified and its legal system
rudimentary. Beijing's ability to impose its will is in question, and
is being tested further by the upheavals associated with economic
reform, the Financial Times pointed out.</P>
      <P>These problems and uncertainties do not argue for keeping
Communist China out of the WTO. Nor should Beijing's frustration
tempt it to walk away from the talks. That would risk scaring foreign
investors, on whom Communist China's growth and exports depend, over
fears that it was abandoning economic reform. Rather, a more creative
approach is needed, the Financial Times said.</P>
      <P>The aim should be a clear timetable for phased opening of
Communist China's market after WTO entry. Communist China should make
ambitious liberalization commitments, while being allowed reasonable
time to adjust. The arrangement should be enforceable through the WTO
disputes mechanism, carrying the threat of trade retaliation if
Beijing ignored its obligations, the European economic daily
newspaper said.</P>
      <P>Such a compact would require Beijing first to provide more
concrete evidence that it is willing to accelerate liberalization and
is fully committed to core WTO disciplines. At the least, the United
States and the EU should offer to grant Communist China the full
rights and privileges of WTO membership on entry.</P>
      <P>A political leap of faith is also needed. This month's summit
between Presidents Bill Clinton and Jiang Zemin offers an ideal
opportunity to make it. Both leaders should use the occasion to
launch an initiative to reinvigorate the negotiations. It is also
essential that Clinton demonstrate that the United States genuinely
wants Communist China in the WTO by doing more to build bipartisan
support in Congress, the Financial Times said.</P>
      <P>"In any circumstances, (Communist) China's WTO entry will be a
political gamble, for Beijing and the rest of the world. But its
chances of success will be improve if it is made on realistic terms
which all the players have confidence will be honored," it added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC REPRESENTATIVE IN UK BIDS FAREWELL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>London,  Oct.  18   (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Eugene Y.H. Chien, outgoing Republic of
China representative in the United Kingdom, has called on the local
Chinese community to continue supporting both the Taipei
Representative Office here and his successor.</P>
      <P>Chien, who will soon return to Taiwan to serve as an advisor
to the National Security Council, made the call in a letter issued
recently to the local Chinese community. He also expressed his
appreciation to ROC nationals residing in the United Kingdom for
their support and assistance during the past four and a half years.</P>
      <P>"Because of Taiwan's increased economic clout and its remarkable
progress in democratization, the ROC's image and status in the UK has
been significantly upgraded, helping the two countries develop a
bilateral comprehensive and across-the-board relationship," Chien
said in the letter.</P>
      <P>During his tenure here, two-way Taiwan-UK trade has jumped by 66
percent to US$5 billion annually, while the number of Taiwan students
studying here also grew to about 13,000 from nearly 10,000
previously, according to the letter.</P>
      <P>During the same period, 15 ministerial or vice-ministerial UK
officials and 49 of their ROC counterparts exchanged visits. About
54,000 UK nationals have traveled to Taiwan, while 44 Taiwan firms
launched investment projects in this European country, it pointed
out.</P>
      <P>Chien attributed all the progress in bilateral ties to the
support of the ROC nationals residing here and the efforts made by
the personnel of the Taipei Representative Office in the UK. He also
thanked the UK government for adopting a more pragmatic approach in
its dealings with Taiwan, which he said "has benefited the people of
both countries."</P>
      <P>He also called for continued support from the local Chinese
community for the representative office and his successor, whose
appointment will be announced soon by the ROC government.</P>
      <P>Chien announced his departure on Oct. 6. The local Chinese
community will hold a farewell party for him on Nov. 2.</P>

      <P>Singapore's retail sales in August fell
by 10.8 percent from July, but remained at the same level as August
last year, the Singapore Department of Statistics said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The total retail sales value in August was estimated at S$2,021
million (about US$1,347 million), down from the July total of S$2,266
million, figures released by the department show.</P>
      <P>Singapore's catering trade in August rose marginally by 0.6
percent over the previous month and 3.3 percent over August 1996, the
department said.</P>
      <P>The total value of catering trade in August was estimated at
S$248 million, compared with S$246 million in July.</P>
      <P>According to the statistics, all retail sales, except general

    <HEADLINE>NEW ROC REPRESENTATIVE TO US URGES SUPPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Oct. 18 (CNA)
(By Pan Ying-chen &amp; Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>New Republic of China Representative to
the United States Stephen Chen on Saturday asked the overseas Chinese
community in the United States to have confidence in the ROC, saying
that it is a free and democratic country, in sharp contrast to
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks in his first press conference with local
Chinese-language media at the ROC's Twin Oaks diplomatic compound
shortly after his arrival in Washington, DC earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that following the first popular presidential election
in Taiwan last March, the American think tank Freedom House for the
first time listed the ROC as a "totally free" country, while mainland
China was rated "not free."</P>
      <P>Asked to describe his feelings on taking up the new post, Chen
said he feels it is a difficult task, but that he is willing to
accept any challenge and do his utmost to help cement bilateral ties
between the two countries and expand cooperation in various fields.</P>
      <P>Chen's initial test will come in the first weeks of his new job,
as mainland China's President Jiang Zemin will arrive in the United
States on Oct. 26 for a state visit and hold a summit meeting with
his counterpart President Bill Clinton on Oct. 29.</P>
      <P>The US government has assured Taipei on several occasions that
the Washington-Beijing engagement will not harm the interests of
Taiwan, Chen said, adding that the ROC government has no intention of
souring the summit atmosphere, and even would like to see the
meeting prove successful.</P>
      <P>The ROC's consistent hope is that Taipei-Washington relations
will develop parallel to links between Washington and Beijing.</P>
      <P>Chen cited reports that a 20-member delegation, headed by
mainland China's State Planning Commission Vice Minister Zeng Peiyan,
will arrive in the US prior to Jiang's visit to purchase aerospace
products, cars, energy resources and chemical fertilizer, the total
value of which could reach billions of US dollars.</P>
      <P>In addition, Jiang will reportedly announce at the summit meeting
plans to place orders for commercial airplanes manufactured by Boeing
worth some US$2 billion. Those high-profile purchases will give
Americans the impression that mainland China is an important market
for US goods and a source of many job opportunities for the American
people, Chen said.</P>
      <P>In fact, Chen said, the mainland has to date imported only 32
aircraft made by Boeing, while China Airlines and EVA Air in Taiwan
have purchased 38 planes from the American manufacturer. The ROC
imported some US$18.41 billion worth of goods from the US in 1996, 50
percent more than did mainland China, making Taiwan the third largest
buyer in Asia after Japan and South Korea.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that the ROC should make more efforts to let Americans
gain a better understanding of the close trade and economic relations
between Taiwan and the United States as a way to win greater support
among Americans.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The total value of orders placed with
Taiwan manufacturers by foreign buyers might exceed US$10 billion in
September, an official of the Ministry of Economic Affairs said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>He said the statistics being compiled by the MOEA indicate that
Taiwan manufacturers received more export orders in September than
in August, and that the demand for Taiwan electronics, information,
and communications products in the world market remain strong.</P>
      <P>Taiwan manufacturers received US$10.2 billion worth of export
orders in August. They have received more than US$10 billion worth of
export orders each month since March.</P>
      <P>The official declined to predict whether the recent devaluation
of the New Taiwan dollar may effectively boost Taiwan's export
trade. The US dollar surged continuously in the past few days in the
Taiwan foreign exchange market to close at NT$29.76 Saturday, which
is a 10-year high.</P>
      <P>He said it is hard to predict at the present time the effect of
currency devaluation on Taiwan's export trade, because the
currencies of many other countries have devaluated much more steeply
than the New Taiwan dollar in recent weeks.

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A total of 853 illegal investment projects
worth US$3.7 billion made by Taiwan companies in mainland China were
registered with the government prior to a Sept. 30 amnesty deadline,
the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said on Monday.</P>
      <P>The Investment Commission under the MOEA said the figure
represents a noticeable jump from the 806 cases worth US$2 billion
which surfaced in 1994, when the government issued a similar amnesty,
allowing local companies to register their illegal mainland
investment projects without penalty.</P>
      <P>In line with its policy aimed at cooling the mainland investment
fever among Taiwan businesses, the MOEA issued the call again earlier
this year, demanding that those companies which have launched
operations on the mainland without government permission fall into
compliance with new regulations promulgated on July 15.</P>
      <P>Those who fail to register will be continuously subject to fines
of up to NT$5 million until they withdraw the illegal investments,
MOEA officials said.</P>
      <P>According to the officials, the Investment Commission has
compiled a list of about 700 local firms with illegal operations in
mainland China and it will continue to screen the list in an effort
to punish those who evade ROC regulations.</P>
      <P>Taiwan still maintains a ban on direct investment by local firms
in mainland China. Those enterprises which wish to launch operations
there through branches or affiliates in third areas must first
receive government permission.</P>

Monday.</P>
      <P>"Minister Chiang resumed work on Saturday," the ministry said in

      <P>The 75-year-old three-star general offered to resign on Oct. 11
to take responsibility for the crash of an Air Force C-130H transport
plane at Taipei's Sungshan Airport on the ROC's Double Tenth National

      <P>Both President Lee Teng-hui and Premier Siew strongly urged
Chiang to stay on for the country's overall interests.</P>
      <P>Siew later gave Chiang a two-week leave for him to reconsider his
resignation bid.</P>
      <P>On Friday, the premier returned Chiang's resignation letter to
which Siew attached a note saying he disapproved Chiang's request to
step down.</P>
      <P>An MND spokesman said although Chiang's two-week leave has not

consideration of the ministry's heavy workload.</P>
      <P>Chiang had served as Army commander-in-chief, the vice chief of

Teng-hui and national policy adviser before assuming his current post
in late 1994.</P>
      <P>Military observers said it will be difficult for the government
to find a suitable replacement for Chiang at the moment. His
departure would affect plans to trim military personnel, which call

    <HEADLINE>CPC NOT TO ADJUST OIL PRICES BEFORE MID-NOVEMBER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  20  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Domestic oil prices will not be adjusted
before mid-November, Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC) Chairman Chen
Chao-wei said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at a joint meeting of the Legislative Yuan's
budget, financial and economic affairs committees, Chen admitted that
the CPC, the sole oil products supplier in Taiwan, is facing pressure
to adjust its prices because of the recent currency fluctuation and
hikes in crude oil prices in the international market.</P>
      <P>Chen said the CPC's crude oil purchase costs would increase
US$500 million if the local currency depreciated NT$1 against the US
greenback. In fact, the New Taiwan dollar has devalued more than NT$1
over the past few days.</P>
      <P>Moreover, international oil prices have risen to an average of
US$19 to US$20 per barrel, higher than the US$17.5 projected in the
CPC's budget plan for the current fiscal year, which started from
July 1 this year.</P>
      <P>"Against this background, we have felt the pressure to raise our
product prices," Chen said, but he added that the state-run company
has decided not to immediately pass on its increased costs to local
consumers.</P>
      <P>Chen apologized for the CPC over a spate of accidents at its oil
refineries and distribution facilities in recent months, which have
resulted in human casualties and heavy property damage. "We therefore
will not adjust prices for our products for the time being," Chen
noted, adding that local petroleum product prices will be maintained
at the current levels until at least mid-November.</P>
      <P>This was the first time that Chen testified before the
Legislature since he assumed his current post on Oct. 9. Because of
the frequency of public safety-related accidents at CPC facilities,
the company has changed its top executive three times over the past
year.</P>
      <P>The Legislature's economic affairs committee has asked Chen to
deliver a report next week on the company's plan to improve its
safety measures and upgrade the morale of its staff.</P>

China's President Jiang Zemin for political negotiations across the
Taiwan Strait by describing the proposal as "nothing new."</P>
      <P>Sheu said Jiang's call is no different from statements made in

      <P>The Sunday Telegraph newspaper quoted health economist Paul Gross
as saying that the visitation rate in 1993 was 1.6 for the United
States and 4.9 for France, while the visitation rate in the United
Kingdom was about half that of Australia, he said. He did not have
these countries' figures for 1996, but said the Australian figure was
still well ahead.</P>
      <P>Despite the high rate of visitation, GPs in Australia are locked
in a battle with the federal government over their payments under the
Medicare system.</P>
      <P>Medicare payments to GPs has been increased by just 0.85 percent
in the past two years, but doctors claim that in the same period,
their costs have gone up by about 10 percent.</P>
      <P>"We certainly want to make it very clear that the (Medicare)
rebates are not keeping up with our costs," Australian Medical
Association vice president David Brand told the Sunday Telegraph.</P>

      <P>Istanbul is this week hosting the 12th
General Assembly of the World Tourism Organization (WTO), where the
world's top tourism decision-makers will be shaping the future of one
of the world's most important economic sectors.</P>
      <P>The biannual global summit brings together leaders of the tourism
sector in order to make decisions that will successfully guide the
industry into the 21st century. According to the WTO, international
tourist arrivals will triple over the next two decades, soaring to
1.6 billion arrivals annually by 2020.</P>
      <P>Tourism ministers and deputy ministers from about 120 countries,
high-level officials, representatives of hotel chains, tourism
companies, airlines, tour operators and educational institutions will
be included amongst the 1,000 delegates from around the world who are

    <HEADLINE>NEW PANEL SET UP TO HELP MAKE S'PORE A GLOBAL CITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Oct.  20 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong
on Sunday announced the setting up of the Singapore 21 Committee,
whose task will be to look into the intellectual, emotional,
spiritual, cultural and social needs of Singaporeans.</P>
      <P>The 10-member panel, headed by Education Minister Teo Chee Hean,
will suggest new ideas to make Singapore a global city and provide
the best possible environment for Singaporeans.</P>
      <P>It will look beyond securing economic and material comforts, and
focus on "the heartware of Singapore -- our love for the country, our
rootedness and our sense of community and nationhood," the prime
minister said.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the opening of the Second Triennial Conference for
Grassroots Leaders, he explained that the committee would form five
subcommittees, each concentrating on a dilemma facing Singapore and
finding ways to resolve problems in that area.</P>
      <P>The committee members -- eight new MPs and two nominated MPs --
will chair the subcommittees, responsible for five areas:</P>
      <P>-- internationalization and regionalization versus Singapore as
home;</P>
      <P>-- a less stressful life versus retaining drive;</P>
      <P>-- attracting talent versus looking after Singaporeans;</P>
      <P>-- the needs of senior citizens versus the aspirations of the
younger generation; and</P>
      <P>-- consultation and consensus versus decisiveness and quick
action.</P>
      <P>The panel's deliberations will be completed by the end of next
year, and a report will be submitted to the prime minister in the
first quarter of 1999.</P>
      <P>Goh first mentioned the committee at his National Day Rally
speech in August.</P>
      <P>Teo said afterwards that the committee would seek to establish a
consensus among Singaporeans about the kind of society they want in
the 21st century.</P>
      <P>"However, we do not want to generate a list of things which the
government and other government agencies have to do," he said.</P>
      <P>"We want to draw up a wide range of initiatives not only for the
government, but also for the community, voluntary organizations and
even for individuals and families, perhaps reflecting attitudes which
they should hold on various national issues."</P>
      <P>The panel will hold focused group discussion involving small
gatherings of Singaporeans, and seminars and forums for the general
public.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the committee's composition of mostly younger MPs
in their 30's, Teo said they were chosen as they will form the core
of Singapore's leadership in the next century.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JAPANESE IMPORTERS WANT LOWER COAL PRICES FROM AUSSIE SUPPLIERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct.  20  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Japanese importers are expected to
renegotiate prices of coking and steaming coal from their Australian
suppliers this week, with the resulting price-levels to become a
benchmark for Australian exports to Taiwan and South Korea.</P>
      <P>Japan -- the biggest importer of Australian coal -- is expected
to ask for price cuts of between 6 percent and 8 percent this year,
industry sources said.</P>
      <P>The sources believed Australian companies, including Shell Ltd.,
CRA Ltd. and BHP Coal Corp., will face tough bargaining.</P>
      <P>Coking prices are generally set between Nippon Steel Corp. and
the large Australian coal producers with negotiated prices coming
into effect at the beginning of the Japanese financial year in April.</P>
      <P>Last year Australian producers suffered price cuts of US$2.00 to
US$3.00 a ton to a benchmark price of US$44.70.</P>
      <P>After coking prices are set, the Japanese power utilities
negotiate with Australian producers to fix the steaming coal prices,
the sources said.</P>
      <P>Last year, steaming prices dropped US$2.65 a ton and the sources
said they expect a further US$2.00 cut, setting the steaming coal
price at US$37.65 per ton.</P>
      <P>Australia is facing tough negotiations in setting its coal prices
because the recent strikes by coalmine workers would put exporters in
worse conditions and Japanese buyers are expected to cash in on such
Australian problems to ask for lower prices, the sources said.</P>
      <P>Usually Australian exporters use the set prices of their coal
with Japanese buyers to sell their products to Taiwan and Korea, two
of the major importers from Australia.
 Australia exports about A$8 billion of coal to Japan, Taiwan, Korea
and other countries each year.</P>

    <DATELINE>Jakarta,  Oct. 20 (CNA)
(By Wu Pin-chiang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Suharto urged the ruling Golkar
to ensure that the people support his renomination for the 1998-2003
presidency, saying he does not want to be seen as hampering
leadership succession.</P>
      <P>"We all have five months (until the March presidential election)
to check whether (the people's trust exists), he was quoted by the
Jakarta Post as saying in an off-the-cuff remark after delivering an
address at Golkar's 33rd anniversary reception here Sunday night.</P>
      <P>Speaking in his capacity as the ruling organization's chief
patron, Suharto was responding to Golkar's announcement minutes
earlier that it was renominating him for another term of office.</P>
      <P>Suharto said he wanted to be sure that people were not forced to
support him.</P>
      <P>"I hope their trust is not a pseudo one because if so I would be
accused of obstructing succession, an obstacle to the regeneration
process," he said. "I could also be accused of being a complacent
Golkar cadre, being a president for six terms and now wanting a
seventh term."</P>
      <P>Suharto's audience of some 5,000 people was apparently moved by
his search for assurance that they responded to many of his remarks.</P>
      <P>When he said: Is it really true that the renomination is a
reflection of people's trust for me?" some in the audience yelled:
"It's true!"</P>
      <P>Suharto was first elected president in 1968 by the Provisional
People's Consultative Assembly and subsequently re-elected for five
consecutive terms.</P>
      <P>His current term will expire in March next year and the
1,000-strong People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) will meet to elect
a president and vice president.</P>
      <P>Golkar chairman Harmoko said earlier in the reception that Golkar
was certain that "the nation's best son, who fulfills all the
criteria as president for the 1998-2003 term, is Haji Muhammad
Suharto."</P>
      <P>The audience, which included Vice President Try Sutrisno and his
wife Tuti, along with representatives of the ruling political parties
from friendly countries, cheered and gave a standing ovation for the

      <P>Although the stock prices have dropped
sharply in Taiwan in recent days, the time is not ripe for the

    <TEXT>
      <P>The member countries of the Asian Pacific
League for Freedom and Democracy (APLFD) on Sunday unanimously passed
a resolution supporting an active role for the Republic of China in
international organizations.</P>
      <P>Coming at the conclusion of the APLFD's two-day annual meeting in
Melbourne, the statement notes that the ROC is a fully democratic
country. It has achieved spectacular economic development and is a
major global economic force as one of the world's principal trading
and investor nations.</P>
      <P>The resolution also says the ROC has significantly contributed
financial resources as well as technical expertise to many developing
countries around the world. In turn, the international community has
reacted positively to the ROC's quest for international participation
as evidenced by its membership in the Asian Development Bank, the
Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, and its active role in
various regional institutions of Southeast Asia as well as Central
and South America.</P>
      <P>"In view of the foregoing, be it resolved that the APLFD calls on
its members to render full support to enable the ROC to play an even
more active role in international organizations and institutions in
the global community, thus contributing her share to the well-being
of all peoples," the resolution says.</P>
      <P>About 100 delegates from 14 countries, including the host
Australia, took part in the meeting. They issued a joint communique
at the conclusion of the meeting Sunday afternoon, calling for a
strengthening of links among the peoples of the Asian Pacific region.</P>
      <P>The communique also acknowledged the efforts of Bob Halverson,
speaker of the Australian Parliament, in promoting regional economic
cooperation, the universality of human rights and the growth of
democratic institutions throughout the region.</P>
      <P>It also acknowledged the call by Dr. Tze-chi Chao, president of
the World League for Freedom and Democracy, for Asian peoples to
develop a common consciousness to avoid the scourge of war.</P>
      <P>Chao said: "Looking back on the history of the past half-century
or more, we recall that the Second World War first erupted in Asia,
and that the culmination of that conflict also took place in this
region. During those years, the whole of Asia was consumed with
incessant fighting and bloodshed.</P>
      <P>"The Asian people suffered innumerable hardships in that horrific
life and death struggle. And throughout the subsequent Cold War era,
Asia continued to be shrouded in the clouds of gunfire. People's
lives and property were subjected to untold destruction. The bitter
agony of those times is still fresh in our memories."</P>
      <P>Paul Tovua, parliamentary speaker of the Soloman Islands, spoke
of the continuing need to build democratic institutions and uphold
the principles of human rights in the Pacific Island states.</P>
      <P>General Moon-Suk Lee, secretary general of the APLFD's Korea
Chapter, warned of the dangers to mankind by the continuing presence
of totalitarianism and said North Korea remains a destabilizing
influence in the region.</P>
      <P>The APLFD, formerly the Asian Pacific Anti-Communist League, was
renamed seven years ago in the wake of the disintegration of the
Soviet Union and its East Bloc allies. It presently has a membership
of 30 countries.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  20  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Issues related to Taiwan are not on the
agenda of an upcoming meeting between US President Bill Clinton and
his mainland Chinese counterpart, Jiang Zemin, new Minister of
Foreign Affairs Jason Hu said on Monday.</P>
      <P>"According to a briefing given by US authorities to our
government, Taiwan is not among the eight topics to be discussed in
the Oct. 29 Clinton-Jiang summit in Washington, D.C.," said Hu, who
has just ended a 14-month stint as the Republic of China's de facto
ambassador to the United States and returned this morning to Taipei
to assume his new post.</P>
      <P>While expecting Jiang to bring up Taiwan-related issues in a
"certain form" during his talks with Clinton, Hu said he doesn't
believe that the summit will lead to any break in Washington's
present policy toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"A basic understanding between Taipei and Washington is that the
United States will not sacrifice Taiwan's interests in its engagement
with Beijing and will not make any decision that might surprise or
shock our government and people," the Oxford-educated minister told
the local press after his swearing-in ceremony.</P>
      <P>Hu, who was sworn in four hours after his return to Taipei at
6:30 a.m. on Monday, said he will try to achieve a new balance
between promoting pragmatic diplomacy and improving relations across
the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Noting that pragmatic diplomacy "is a necessity like life, as
worth treasuring as breath and as natural as sunlight," Hu said he is
convinced that mainland China's incessant attempts to suppress
Taiwan's pragmatic diplomatic activities is mainly a result of
Beijing's misunderstanding of the ROC's policy goals.</P>
      <P>The former government spokesman who seems blessed with boundless
energy and enjoys an easy rapport with people, said at his
swearing-in ceremony that on his way from Chiang Kai-shek
International Airport to Taipei early this morning, he felt an
impulse to jump out of his car and declare to the people that "he's
back" to take up his new assignment as the country's top diplomatic
officer.</P>
      <P>"Today is the most glorious day of my life, as I have been
pursuing a diplomatic career since picking the department of
diplomacy of National Chengchi University as my top choice 30 years
ago," an elated Hu said, adding that he will dedicate himself fully
to promoting pragmatic diplomacy in a manner more acceptable to all
the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Vice Premier John Chang, who was also Hu's immediate predecessor,
lauded Hu as a knowledgeable, capable and smart diplomat, most
suitable for his new job.</P>
      <P>"I'm convinced that Hu, as our country's 13th foreign minister,
will be able to open a new chapter in our diplomatic history," Chang
said. He also encouraged Hu "never to give up" in carrying out
diplomatic work.</P>
      <P>Chang also explained his advocacy of "fighting fire with fire" in
expanding the ROC's diplomatic frontiers during his 22-month stint as
the minister of foreign affairs.</P>
      <P>"To develop diplomatic ties with other countries is to defend our
sovereignty, consolidate our international status, create an
international climate favorable for cross-strait dialogue and
negotiations on an equal footing, as well as to maintain the dignity
of our 21.5 million people," Chang said, adding: "To protect our
liberal, democratic way of life from any threat, we should neither
become self-suspicious nor confine ourselves to this small enclave.
We should never retreat and should always walk out bravely and firmly
into the world."</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  20  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's computer industry has greatly
sharpened its global competitiveness recently and currently ranks
second in three different categories -- manufacture, design and
packaging of wafers -- behind Japan, the United States and South
Korea, respectively, according to a survey prepared by the
state-financed Industrial Technology Research Institute.</P>
      <P>The report, which won a prize for distinguished study from the
Economics Ministry, analyzed the worldwide integrated circuit
industry in 1996, saying that Taiwan in the early 1990s lagged
behind, in relative terms, in wafer design and packaging, while
concentrating its efforts on improving the manufacturing process,
which is why Taiwan's market shares failed to increase in line with
its technological edge.</P>
      <P>Given the huge amount of investment needed in wafer development
and the construction of wafer factories, IC manufacturers globally
are forming joint ventures to design and produce new products, with
the purpose of sharing both R&amp;D costs and the risks of competition.</P>
      <P>As a result, the report pointed out, new industrial alliances are
sprouting up in the field, while the competition between different
alliances is intensifying.</P>
      <P>Against this background, the report urged the industry to speed
up its globalization and step up the interaction between up- and
down-stream firms to fulfill the government-set goal of churning out
US$66 billion-worth of IC products by 2005.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Leading lawmakers from Taiwan on Sunday
called for mainland China to resolve the Taiwan problem through
peaceful means and urged member countries of the Asian Pacific League
for Freedom and Democracy to play a role.</P>
      <P>In a panel discussion at the APLFD annual conference in
Melbourne, Legislator Chang Chun-hung, a leading member of the
Democratic Progressive Party in Taiwan, said he was exploring new
means of promoting improved relations between Taiwan and mainland
China.</P>
      <P>He expressed concern that lingering tensions between Taiwan and
China could eventually lead to disaster.</P>
      <P>Chang said he hoped that the APLFD members can help to build a
constructive dialogue in Asia that would serve to avert such
conflicts.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chen Yi-hsin of the New Party asked Beijing to give up
its insistence Taiwan is a part of the People's Republic of China. He
said only by recognizing the reality of separate rule on the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait can the issue of China's unification be
resolved.</P>
      <P>Chen said Taiwan has completed its democratic transformation
peacefully and expressed hope that mainland China can do the same.</P>
      <P>He said a peaceful solution to the problem of the Taiwan Strait
would enhance the peace and progress of both the Asian region and the
global community.</P>
      <P>In his paper presented at the conference, Professor Tai Wan-chin
of Tamkang University urged the United States to play a practical and
constructive role in cross-strait affairs.</P>
      <P>He urged Washington to be straightforward in safeguarding the
security of Taiwan and not to maintain an ambiguous stand in dealing

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  20  (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The rapid depreciation of the New Taiwan
dollar against the US dollar in recent days is not expected to
trigger an upward spiral in Taiwan's consumer price index for the
time being, a government official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Hsu Chang-yao, an official with the Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS), said that despite its fall
against the greenback, the NT dollar has remained relatively strong
compared with other major international currencies such as the
Japanese yen and German mark.</P>
      <P>Hsu noted that the while the NT dollar has shed 7 percent against
the US dollar over the past few days, the Japanese yen has plunged 10
percent against the greenback and the German mark even more than
that.</P>
      <P>Japan is Taiwan's largest source of imports, accounting for 25-30
percent of the island's total import value, while imports from
Germany account for 4 to 5 percent of the total. The pressure for a
price rise in imported goods is therefore limited, the official said.</P>
      <P>The prices of industrial and agricultural materials on the
international markets are stable, he said, adding that the wholesale
price index has been dropping for the past few months.</P>
      <P>A DGBAS report issued earlier this month estimated the overall
consumer price index will rise 1.67 percent in 1997 but noted that
this figure might be as low as 1.5 percent, Hsu said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A law enforcement official in the central
Taiwan city of Taichung said Monday that while local prosecutors will
cooperate fully with Manila's investigation into the death of a
Philippine maid in Taiwan, the local prosecutor's file on the case
will be off-limits to Philippine investigators because of there is no
legal basis for giving them such access.</P>
      <P>Responding to reporters' questions, Chen Chung-ming, director of
the Taichung District Prosecutor's Office, said that if Philippine
investigators contact his office through diplomatic channels, it
would explain in detail its reasons for ruling out foul play in the
death of Elyrose M. Miguel and closing the case.</P>
      <P>However, Chen said, a foreign government cannot receive access to
official investigation files without a statutory basis for this.</P>
      <P>Miguel, who arrived in Taiwan in early March, was found dead on
March 24 at her Taichung workplace, the office of Taiwan Provincial
Assemblyman Yen Ching-piao. She had been hired by Yen's wife.</P>
      <P>Although no suicide note was ever found, prosecutor Lee
Yueh-chih, who presided over the autopsy, said she discovered many
notes written by Miguel showing she was in a state of deep

up no evidence suggesting foul play, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Philippine President Fidel Ramos, however, has reportedly ordered

months of this year, up 5.4 percent from the same period last year, a
government report said Monday.</P>
      <P>The Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics
(DGBAS) said that Taiwan-made products accounted for 11.7 percent of

    <TEXT>
      <P>Lithuania has expressed a keen interest in
reinforcing relations with the Republic of China, a local newspaper
said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The China Times quoted Lithuanian Prime Minister Gediminas
Vagnorius as saying in a recent interview with the paper that he
hopes the two countries can exchange representative offices in the
first half of next year to facilitate bilateral engagements.</P>
      <P>Vagnorius, who once visited Taiwan in August 1992, said Lithuania
and Taiwan already signed an agreement on the exchange of commercial
offices in July 1991.</P>
      <P>"We hope the accord can be implemented as soon as possible to
facilitate bilateral trade, investment and tourist exchanges,"
Vagnorius was quoted as saying in the interview.</P>
      <P>Vagnorius first assumed the Lithuanian premiership in 1991,
shortly after the Baltic country declared independence, but stepped
down in 1992 after an alliance composed of former Communist Party
members won the parliamentary election. He managed to reclaim the
office in November 1996 after his Conservative Party formed a
coalition cabinet with the Christian Democratic Party and the Central
Party.</P>
      <P>Vagnorius said he vividly remembers his previous visit to Taiwan.
Describing Taiwan as a "new, outstanding and strong" country,
Vagnorius said he admires its achievements in economic and political
reforms, adding that Lithuania has much to learn from Taiwan,
particularly its strategies for economic development and trade
promotion.</P>
      <P>The Lithuanian prime minister said he thinks the international
community should give Taiwan more recognition and support. "This is
not only because Taiwan is an economic powerhouse but also because
Taiwan can assist mainland China in political democratization," he
noted.</P>
      <P>Lithuania recognizes mainland China, but Vagnorius said his
country would be willing to host visits by senior ROC officials if
they present applications.</P>
      <P>Asked whether he is likely to visit Taiwan again, Vagnorius said
he needs time to make necessary preparations. "At least, I must wait
until my country is admitted to the European Union (EU)."</P>
      <P>Vagnorius further said the Lithuanian government will take
concrete steps to show its sincerity in welcoming Taiwan investors.
"We hope to win Taiwan investors' confidence in our investment
climate and administrative efficiency."</P>
      <P>Vagnorius said Taiwan investors are welcome to buy into large
Lithuanian private enterprises or to invest in its major
infrastructure construction projects. To facilitate its "free
economic zone" project, Lithuania is constructing an airport at
Siauliai and a seaport at Kleipeda. "Taiwan investors are welcome to
invest in the two projects."</P>
      <P>Lithuania will also offer preferential tax incentives to Taiwan
entrepreneurs intending to invest in its free economic zone,
Vagnorius said, adding that Taiwan investors can use his country as a
bridgehead to tap markets in Russia and the EU because Lithuania has
signed convenient export/import agreements with those two entities.</P>
      <P>Lithuania declared independence from the now-defunct Soviet Union
in 1990 and is now recognized by more than 60 countries around the
world. It has also joined the United Nations, the International
Monetary Fund, the World Bank and several other major international
organizations. It is now a quasi-member of the EU and a "peace
partner" of NATO.</P>
      <P>As Lithuania has encountered some difficulties gaining full
membership in both the EU and NATO, Vagnorius said he sympathizes
with Taiwan over all the discrimination it has endured in the world
community. "I wish your country a prosperous future," he said at the
end of the interview.</P>

      <P>A Siemens business executive swam safely to
shore Monday after drifting in the sea for nearly 17 hours, police
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Michael Maquet, sales director for the ASP Line of Business
Siemens Nixdorf Information Systems, Taiwan branch, and Horst Mueck,
chairman of Bayer Taiwan Company, went sailing in a catamaran off
Paishawan, Shihmen Village, Taipei County, on Sunday afternoon.</P>
      <P>Because of unusually high waves in the area, the craft carrying
the two men capsized three times. After the third time, Mueck managed
to climb back aboard the catamaran, only to find that Maquet was
missing.</P>
      <P>Mueck promptly returned to shore after finding no trace of
Maquet. Helicopters, coast guard vessels and fishing boats were
mobilized to search for Maquet.</P>
      <P>Maquet's Taiwan-born wife Chang Shih-hwa was waiting anxiously
onshore at Paishawan, but had to return home after the rescue
operation was called off around 8:00 p.m. She returned to Paishawan
again at 4:00 a.m. Monday, hoping for a miracle.</P>
      <P>Later, Maquet said he had survived by keeping his cool and by a
strong will to live. Knowing that a rescue team would attempt to find
him, he utilized his skills as a trained lifeguard in continuously
kicking his feet to keep warm. He said he was able to see the shore
from time to time throughout the ordeal.</P>
      <P>After nightfall, he realized that nobody would come for him
during the evening hours. In order to orient himself, he remained
still so as to test the direction of the current, which enabled him
to be certain that he was drifting along the shoreline.</P>
      <P>Maquet said that he was carried by the current of the sea, and
that after nearly three hours in the Paishawan area, he began
drifting in a northeasterly direction toward Keelung for six more
hours. Later, he began drifting back to Paishawan, and then to the
east.</P>
      <P>He approached the shoreline on three occasions, but each time had
to yield to the strong current in order to conserve his energy.</P>
      <P>At around 6:00 a.m. Monday, fortune turned his way as he drifted
near Keelungyu and he successfully fought to reach the offshore
islet, where he rested for half an hour before he gathered enough
energy to find a group of soldiers who were stationed there. He was
treated to a hot meal and eventually reunited with his family.</P>
      <P>Maquet estimated that he had drifted about 65 kilometers in the
sea and at one time spotted a fishing boat just five meters away.
Although he shouted to his utmost, the ship slowly sailed away to his
dismay.</P>
      <P>Although the 53-year-old German businessmen is an experienced
seafarer, he vowed that he will not go out on the catamaran again
without proper safety equipment, such as flares or rescue balloons.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CAL GETS FIRST BOEING 747-400 DESIGNED UNDER NEW CONCEPT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Seattle,  Oct. 20 (CNA)
(By J.C. Lu and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The first Boeing 747-400 passenger plane
designed under new concepts to better accommodate the needs of
passengers was turned over to China Airlines at a ceremony in
Seattle on Monday afternoon.</P>
      <P>A CAL spokesman said that, in order to expand its flight services
and speed up the phase-out of aging aircraft, it will introduce five
Boeing 744-400 and eight Boeing 737-800 passenger planes to its fleet
by late 1998. It is expected that the CAL fleet will increase from
the current 44 aircraft to 56 by the end of next year.</P>
      <P>After the addition of the new planes, CAL will undertake to
make some adjustments in its plane assignments and flight routes. The
747-400s, which have the biggest passenger capacity, will fly the
trans-Pacific flights to North America.</P>
      <P>MD-11 planes will fly to destinations in Russia and Europe, while
Airbus models will service cities in the Asian Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Beginning next January, CAL will increase the number of weekly
Taiwan-Los Angeles flights to 14 from the present 11. Expansion of
the schedule to two flights daily is expected to remain a lucrative
prospect.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Catherine Chang, director-general of the Taipei
Economic and Cultural Office in Seattle, said during the ceremony
that if domestic carriers can make joint purchases of aircraft, they
would be in a better position to negotiate prices. She said this
would also help to upgrade the aviation industry in Taiwan and to
develop the local parts and components market.</P>
      <P>Chang, who was recently appointed as the ROC ambassador to Saint
Christopher and Nevis as well as to Dominica, said that during her
three years in Seattle she has steadily worked to promote cultural
and trade exchanges between Taiwan and the western part of the
United States.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's first woman ambassador also revealed that Washington
Governor Gary Locke, the first Chinese-American governor in the
United States, will visit Taiwan next April.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  21  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Economics Minister Wang Chih-kang on
Tuesday denied that the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) has
delivered a report on whether to exclude mainland China from the
application of multilateral trade agreements after it is admitted to
the World Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at a Legislative Yuan floor session, Wang said
the WTO charter provides for non-application of multilateral trade
agreements between particular members.</P>
      <P>"Whether to employ the non-application clause toward Beijing
concerns our overall policy toward mainland China, and we must
address the issue in accordance with our National Unification
Guidelines," Wang said.</P>
      <P>At the moment, Wang said, the government has not yet begun to
mull the issue, nor has the economics ministry released a report on
the topic.</P>
      <P>The priority tasks for the MOEA at present are to speed up
bilateral consultations with Taiwan's major trade partners on the
island's WTO accession terms, Wang said, adding that the ROC has
wound up bilateral talks with 21 of the 26 WTO members which have
expressed intention of conducting negotiations with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wang said many factors should be considered in determining
whether to employ the "non-application" clause toward mainland China,
including whether or not cross-strait relations have entered a
medium-term stage as well as the possible impact of such action, or
lack of it, on Taiwan's agriculture, manufacturing and service
industries.</P>
      <P>"We don't need to make a decision at the moment," Wang said,
adding that the government will make an appropriate decision at the
proper time based on national interests.</P>
      <P>Chen Ruey-long, director-general of the Board of Foreign Trade,
said last week that Taiwan has clearly defined rights to determine
whether to employ the "non-application" clause toward mainland China.</P>
      <P>"We do not need to discuss the issue with any particular WTO
member as a prerequisite for our entry to the organization," Chen
said.</P>
      <P>Both Taiwan and mainland China are WTO observers. It remains
uncertain when the two Chinese economies will become full members of
the Geneva-based world trade regulatory body.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  21  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>ROC Foreign Minister Jason Hu on Monday
described the government's mainland and foreign policies as being
opposite sides of the same coin, saying that they are inseparable and
that neither side can be said to be more important than the other.</P>
      <P>Hu, newly sworn in as the nation's top foreign affairs official
after serving as the ROC representative to the United States, said
that Washington's stand of refusing to act as a mediator between
Taipei and Beijing remains unchanged.</P>
      <P>He added that Beijing should not continue to use the channel
provided by its Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits
(ARATS) and Taipei's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) -- the
respective intermediary bodies between the two sides -- a "chip" in
bargaining for a political settlement. He said this could increase
the risk of misjudgment on the part of both sides due to the lack of
more open and direct channels of communication.</P>
      <P>Hu asserted in a news conference Monday night that Taipei has
always been willing to communicate with Beijing and knows the
importance of dialogue. The aim of diplomatic exchanges, he said, is
to allow people in both Taiwan and mainland China, as well as in the
international community, to fully comprehend the true meaning of
pragmatic diplomacy.</P>
      <P>By doing so, Hu explained further, Taipei hopes to convince
Beijing that it is unnecessary to restrict Taiwan's diplomatic
presence and to achieve its goal of "burying the hatchet" with
mainland China.</P>

      <P>Responding to calls by the local business
community to open direct trade and transport ties with mainland
China, President Lee Teng-hui was quoted on Tuesday as saying that
Beijing's ambition to swallow Taiwan must be taken into account.</P>
      <P>Taichung Mayor Lin Poh-jung told a conference which he chaired
that Lee had asked him to convey the government's stance on
cross-strait relations during a 40-minute meeting on Monday morning.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, the ROC president is deeply concerned over the
increased calls by local businesses to open direct trade, shipping
and postal delivery services with the mainland, citing worries over
the effect upon national security.</P>
      <P>Lin, quoting President Lee, warned the public that the Chinese
Communists have spared no efforts to swallow Taiwan and are trying
every means to eradicate the influence of the United States and Japan
in Asia.</P>
      <P>Lin said he was told that Taiwan's security will be threatened if
the government impulsively opens direct trade and transport ties with
mainland China. As the head of state of the Republic of China, Lin
said, President Lee always bears in mind the nation's security and
the safety of the public.</P>
      <P>Lin said Lee had repeated earlier warnings to the business

    <HEADLINE>EXPORT ORDERS HIT NEW HIGH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.   21   (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Export orders received by Taiwan
manufacturers amounted to US$10.89 billion in September, a
single-month high, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) reported
on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The amount marked a 3.62 percent year-on-year rise, according to
ministry tallies. September was also the seventh straight month
that export orders broke the US$10 billion mark.</P>
      <P>Ministry officials said the record-setting amount of the export
orders indicates that Taiwan's economic fundamentals are rosy and
robust. "Local stock investors should keep confidence in the
market," an official urged.</P>
      <P>Information-technology (IT) and communications products remained
the best-selling item, garnering US$1.91 billion worth of orders in
September, up 9.66 percent from the year-earlier level.</P>
      <P>Electronics followed with US$1.86 billion in orders, marking a
23.42 percent year-on-year growth.</P>
      <P>September's orders for both IT and communications products and
electronics were single-month highs.</P>
      <P>Orders for textiles, however, saw a 4.71 percent decline to
US$1.28 billion in September.</P>
      <P>Chang Yao-chung, director-general of the MOEA's statistics
department, said IT, communications and electronics industries have
become the driving force of Taiwan's export growth.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan is highly advanced in these fields, Chang said, the
recent currency fluctuation is not expected to have a significant
impact on orders for electronics, IT and communications products.</P>
      <P>Noting that the fourth quarter is traditionally a boom season for
these three industries, Chang said the current upward trend in
export orders is expected to continue in the months ahead.</P>
      <P>The United States remained Taiwan's largest source of export
orders, contributing US$3.41 billion worth of orders, which marked a
6.57 percent year-on-year gain.</P>
      <P>Orders from Europe picked up 13.13 percent to US$1.922 billion,
while orders from both Hong Kong and Japan declined, down 0.26
percent and 24.82 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>Chang said a combination of factors, including a slowdown in
Japan's IT industry, the fluctuation of currency exchange rates and
the lingering effects of the foot-and-mouth disease that hit local
hog population in mid-March, has resulted in the double-digit fall
in orders from Japan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, an opinion survey conducted by the MOEA in September
found that most local exporters are optimistic about their future
business prospects, with 31.45 percent of the respondents expecting
their orders to increase in October and 41.54 percent expecting the
orders to remain at least at the September's level.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA ACCUSES CHINA OF DOPING OF ITS SWIMMERS, OTHER ATHLETES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct. 21 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Stunned by unbelievable feats by Chinese
swimmers and other athletes recently, Australia has accused
mainland China of doping its swimmers and other athletes again and
asked for serious investigations in a bid to stop the illegal
practices.</P>
      <P>Australia will host the next world swimming championships in
Perth in January 1998 and its head swimming coach Don Talbot has
alleged that "the Chinese are doing things they shouldn't be doing,
no doubt about that."</P>
      <P>More than two years ago, Australia made similar accusations
against mainland Chinese swimmers and other athletes.</P>
      <P>In a recent sports competition in Shanghai, mainland Chinese
swimmers and stars of track and field and weightlifting made
tremendous improvement and performances, which stunned the sports
world, including Australia.</P>
      <P>As a result, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has sent a
drugs expert to mainland China for an investigation into alleged
Chinese doping.</P>
      <P>Australian swimmers at a national camp in Hobart in Tasmania have
been stunned by the extraordinary Chinese times and results filtering
through from the Chinese National Games in Shanghai.</P>
      <P>"It is very disappointing they (Chinese swimmers) are back on
drugs but I plan to use it as a motivation," said Samantha Riley, a
swimming star in Australia.</P>
      <P>Olympic silver medalist Scott Miller said that if drug-testers do
find evidence of drug abuse in mainland China, "they should ban the
whole country."</P>
      <P>Talbot is worried that even if IOC drug testing is stepped up in
China, cheats will escape because they are using undetectable growth
hormones.</P>
      <P>"If we are serious about drug testing, then you have to do more
than pee in a bottle," Talbot told reporters.</P>
      <P>He called for the introduction of blood testing to help detect
the illegal use of hormones.</P>
      <P>In response to comments by Talbot and Australian swimmers, FINA
honorary secretary Gunnar Werner said the complaints about mainland
Chinese drug-taking came only from the leading swimming countries,
including the United States and Australia.</P>
      <P>"The problems occur for Australia, the United States and to some
extent Canada. Except for them, nobody is that afraid of the Chinese
swimmers," he said.</P>
      <P>He said the Australian claims of mainland Chinese doping were very
natural because Australia will be the venue of the coming world
swimming championships.</P>
      <P>"I'm a little disappointed with that counter-reaction without any
proof. I think they should not start the day after a new world
record," he said.</P>
      <P>But many foreign observers believe the Shanghai games reflected
that mainland Chinese provinces have increased their systematized
doping of their athletes after the Atlantic Games in 1996 so that
they can win in competitions.</P>
      <P>Forbes Carlile, who is a member of the World Swim Coaches'
anti-doping commission, said: "They (the mainland Chinese athletes)
have had a huge improvement in the last 13 months and how do they
explain such dramatic increases in nearly every event in swimming? It
will be a battleground in Perth if there are positive tests. We can't
stand by and watch this happen."</P>
      <P>At the 1996 Atlantic Games, the mainland Chinese won only one
swimming medal and blamed their poor results on inadequate training
methods.</P>
      <P>At the recent Shanghai games, records have been smashed in
weightlifting and track and field. Three world records have been set
by male lifters and the females have bettered world standards in all
eight weight divisions.</P>
      <P>In the track and field events, Li Xuemei clocked a phenomenal
10.79 seconds for the 100 meters, which bettered that of US world
champion Marion Jones who clocked at 10.83 at the world championships
in Athens. Li only clocked 11.2 when she competed in Athens.</P>
      <P>In the 1,500-meter event, there were 12 female mainland Chinese
athletes who clocked under four minutes. In comparison, the previous
fastest time in the world this year was three minutes 58 seconds, set
by Briton Kelly Holmes.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>With thick haze continuing to blanket most
parts of Sumatra and Kalimantan, the Indonesian government issued
another warning Monday that brush and forest fires could escalate.</P>
      <P>Indonesian Minister of the Environment Sarwono Kusumaatmadja said
Monday the latest evaluation by the Meteorological and Geophysics
Agency revealed that the dry season could last for another two weeks.
He said this should serve as a warning to people living in fire-prone
areas.</P>
      <P>"This year's dry season is different from those of previous
years. For the first time ever the dry season deviated (from the
normal pattern)," Sarwono was quoted by the Jakarta Post as saying
after a meeting of ministers.</P>
      <P>"The extended dry spell may add to the risks already facing the
people," he said.</P>
      <P>Indonesia has been hit by a severe drought largely blamed on the
El Nino effect. The drought has contributed to widespread forest
fires.</P>
      <P>Fires, meanwhile, have caused choking smog over a large part of
Southeast Asia.</P>
      <P>Although the government has said the situation was improving,
aggravating haze returned to Pekanbaru, Riau on Monday, just as
locals had again become accustomed to waking up to blue skies.</P>
      <P>Visibility was reduced to only 500 meters Monday, causing the
closure of the Simpang Tiga Airport.</P>
      <P>Simpang Tiga was among 13 airports across Sumatra that have been
closed due to limited visibility since Saturday</P>
      <P>After three months, the haze has yet to ease in Palankaraya,
Central Kalimantan.</P>
      <P>Indonesia's efforts to douse the fires were further boosted
Monday as the French and Japanese governments announced they would
aid in the fight.</P>
      <P>France will donate US$78,600 worth of firefighting equipment,

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT CONSULTATION TO BE BASED ON MUTUAL RESPECT</HEADLINE>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chang King-yuh, chairman of the
Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council, said Tuesday that both sides
of the Taiwan Strait should conduct consultations based on mutual
respect.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks in a question-and-answer session at the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Chang said that for years Taipei has hoped to promote
cross-strait exchanges in a mutually beneficial way so as to advance
understanding between the two sides. But both sides have to rely on
consultations to solve the problems that arise during the process of
exchanges, he said.</P>
      <P>Chang said that such consultations have to be based on mutual
respect. He criticized Beijing for harboring hostility toward Taiwan,
noting that its efforts to isolate the island from the international
scene have never ceased.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China renounced the use of force to solve
cross-strait problems in 1991, when it terminated the Period of
National Mobilization for the Suppression of Communist Rebellion, but
Beijing has yet to reciprocate, Chang noted.</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that after cross-strait talks resume,
Taipei and Beijing will to consult on technical problems so that the
interests of the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait can be
protected. In addition, the talks could also target policy or
political problems, he said.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the purpose of the talks would be to create a
peaceful and stable cross-strait relationship so that both sides can
move toward helping each other, adding that this is also the crux of
President Lee Teng-hui's statement that "Chinese should help
Chinese."</P>
      <P>The door for cross-strait talks is always open, Chang said.
Although all factors point toward such talks resuming sometime next
year, Beijing must first give a positive response, he said.</P>

      <P>The recent free fall of the Taiwan

United States, as the Dow Jones Taiwan Stock Index has almost
plummeted nearly one-third from its previous high.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Stock Index dropped another 301 points Monday, adding
to an aggregate 900-point decline over the previous six trading
sessions. The negative impact was so pervasive that not only Taiwan
stocks, but Taiwan-related stocks and indexes in the United States as
well, are suffering huge losses.</P>
      <P>The Dow Jones Taiwan Stock Index Options, traded in the Pacific

losing almost US$7, or 25 percent, per share.</P>

      <P>It is still unclear if and when the Taiwan stock market will

    <HEADLINE>TANKER CAPTAINS IN OIL-SPILL COLLISION ARRESTED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore, Oct. 21 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The captains of the two tankers involved
in last Wednesday's collision in the Singapore Strait, which resulted
in Singapore's worst-ever oil spill, have been arrested, according
to Singapore Maritime Port Authority (MPA).</P>
      <P>Jan Sokolowski, a Polish national, captained the Orapin Global,
which is owned by Thai International Tankers, headquartered in
Bangkok. Michael Chalkitis, a Greek, skippered the Evoikos, which is
owned by Zebra Shipping of Cyprus.</P>
      <P>The MPA said the 130,000-ton tanker Orapin Global had cut into
the wrong lane and was facing oncoming traffic when it overtook
another vessel in the Singapore Strait minutes before the collision.</P>
      <P>This information came from video footage of radar trackings from
its Vessel Traffic Information System, which showed the paths taken
by both ships in the final 13 minutes before the collision.</P>
      <P>A transcript of the conversation between the radar operator and
the officers from the two ships revealed that the Thai-registered
vessel was warned three times -- the last time six minutes before
colliding with the Evoikos near the boundary which separates
eastbound and westbound shipping lanes in the strait, the MPA said.</P>
      <P>The Orapin Global, which had no cargo, was moving from east to
west in the strait, while the Evoikos was heading east towards
Singapore, carrying 120,000 tons of marine fuel oil.</P>
      <P>They collided at 8:54 p.m., five kilometers south of Pulau
Sebarok island. Visibility was about eight kilometers.</P>
      <P>Although investigations were still going on, congestion and lack
of visibility can be ruled out as causes of the accident, the MPA
said.</P>
      <P>In an update on the oil-spill clean-up efforts, the MPA said the
slick had spread into both Indonesian and Malaysian waters, but
Sentosa Island and the Singapore mainland have not been hit and there
had been no disruption to shipping.</P>
      <P>Although the spillage is under control, clean-up operations are
expected to take several more days as the oil is very thick.</P>
      <P>Some 50 boats and over 300 personnel have been involved in the
clean-up, which was into its sixth day on Tuesday.</P>

      <P>The Catholic Alliance of the United

rally in front of the White House to protest Beijing's persecution of
Catholics and other people of faith in mainland China.</P>
      <P>The rally, scheduled to begin at 4:30 p.m. on Oct. 27, the eve of
Communist Chinese President Jiang Zemin's visit to Washington, will
include a candlelight vigil to remember those people persecuted and

    <HEADLINE>SIEW URGES CONFIDENCE IN TAIWAN'S ECONOMY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  21 (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew said Tuesday that he
sees no reason to be pessimistic about Taiwan's economy given that
the island's economic fundamentals are sound.</P>
      <P>"The stock market is the window of a country's economy and part
of the reflection of its economic strength. The local bourse reflects
on the economic fundamentals in Taiwan, but it is also subject to a
variety of news. The psychological factor plays a role in the stock
market," Siew said.</P>
      <P>The financial turmoil in Southeast Asia and the plunge of Wall
Street last week has eroded investors' confidence, the premier noted.
The local bourse slid 1146.38 points in just a week to end at 7316.78
Monday, with the New Taiwan dollar breaking the mark of 30 to the US
dollar the same day, dropping to a ten-year low of 30.451.</P>
      <P>"Economic problems should be resolved with economic measures. If
the impact of the international financial situation on the local
bourse is short-term and immense, the government should take some
action. If it is long-term, the government should keep its hand out
and let the market follow the world trend," Siew said while answering
questions at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>On the government's action to bolster the flagging stock market,
he said that the government has no intention to intervene in the
bourse, but that the moves are aimed at restoring market order and
helping the market mechanism.</P>
      <P>Siew said that most of the measures announced by Finance Ministry
late Monday have been studied for some time. "We believe the moves
will help stabilize the stock market. And we hope that they can have
long-term effects on the local bourse, not only just one or two
days," Siew added.</P>
      <P>Finance Minister Paul Chiu announced late Monday several measures
to encourage buying and deter selling on the bourse, including
increases on margin lending and short sale deposits. The moves proved
efficient as the local bourse soared 417.27 points to 7734.05
Tuesday.</P>

      <P>Garuda Indonesia handed symbolic
compensation to the beneficiaries of the national flag carrier's
Airbus A-300-B4 crash victims, in 10 cities simultaneously on Monday.</P>
      <P>The state airline company's spokesman Pujobroto was quoted by
state-run Antara news agency as saying Monday that the awarding of
the compensation took place in Medan, Pekanbaru, Palembang, Padang,
Banda Aceh, Jakarta, Yogyakarta, Surabaya, Semarang, Balikpapan and
Denpasar.</P>
      <P>Each compensation package consists of Rp$40 million from the Jasa

compensation.</P>
      <P>According to data from Jasa Raharja, there were altogether 77
deceased persons from North Sumatra who were entitled to the
compensation payments.</P>
      <P>A Garuda airline flight departing from Jakarta for Medan crashed
on Sept. 26 this year at Buah Nabara village in Sibolangit district,

      <P>Suhaimi Pulungan, operations director of PT Jasa Raharja, said
the insurance company was paying out insurance claims to the heirs of
116 other victims of the same crash residing in other cities in
Indonesia.</P>
      <P>Not all the relatives of the 234 victims could received the

    <HEADLINE>S'PORE'S CRUCIAL NON-OIL EXPORTS GET 15.8 PERCENT BOOST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Oct.  21  (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore's crucial non-oil domestic
exports shot up by a strong 15.8 percent last month compared to a
year ago, boosted by exports of key electronic products to the United
States and Europe.</P>
      <P>It was the strongest month of growth in exports of
made-in-Singapore goods since January 1996.</P>
      <P>Analysts and economists said they were "pleasantly surprised" by
the unusually strong trade figure, which is a barometer of
Singapore's manufacturing sector, according to The Straits Times.</P>
      <P>The market had expected 5.9 percent to 6.8 percent growth in
September, following August's moderate 5.5 percent growth.</P>
      <P>But the better-than-expected performance failed to impress the
stock market, and The Straits Times Industrials Index closed down
32.47 points at 1,794.92 Monday.</P>
      <P>Last month's S$8.46 billion (US$5.42 billion) worth of non-oil
exports marked the fourth consecutive month of positive growth this
year.</P>
      <P>Releasing the data, the Singapore Trade Development Board (TDB)
said, "Growth was reflected in key electronic products, such as
semiconductors and printed circuit boards assemblies."</P>
      <P>Computer disk drive exports recorded a more moderate growth of 9
percent. Singapore is the world's leading maker of disk drives.</P>
      <P>On a three-month moving average basis, non-oil domestic exports
rose 9.4 percent in September. This could signal healthy growth in
the months ahead, economists said, adding that some volatility could
still be expected.</P>
      <P>Singapore's non-oil domestic exports to key markets -- the United
States, European Union and Hong Kong -- grew 13.6 percent, 16.9
percent and 33 percent respectively.</P>
      <P>Made-in-Singapore exports to Malaysia grew 6.7 percent
year-on-year, up from August's 3.4 percent, while exports to Thailand
rocketed to 27.5 percent, a big improvement on the 0.7 percent
decline in August.</P>
      <P>A TDB official maintained that the regional currency turmoil had
so far not affected Singapore's foreign trade.</P>
      <P>Boosted by the strong export performance, Singapore's total
foreign trade grew 16.8 percent last month year-on-year to S$34.4
billion (US$22.1 billion).</P>
      <P>Total exports rose 15.7 percent to nearly S$17 billion (US$10.9
billion) and total imports rose 18 percent to S$17.4 billion (US$11.2
billion).</P>
      <P>Re-exports -- goods shipped through Singapore's ports -- rose
20.6 percent to S$7.3 billion (US$4.7 billion).</P>
      <P>Oil exports -- the only negative element in September's trade --
fell 7.6 percent to S$1.2 billion (US$769 million).</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  21  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Jiang Zemin of mainland China
is in no position to compare cross-strait relations with the Civil
War of the United States, James Chug, minister of the Overseas
Chinese Affairs Commission, said here Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Jiang, who is scheduled to visit the United States on Oct.
26-Nov. 2, was interviewed in Shanghai by the Washington Post on Oct.
17. In the interview, he quoted from Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg
Address and compared the relations between Taiwan and mainland China
with the situations of the American civil war.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a ceremony marking the 45th Overseas Chinese Day in
Taipei, Chu said the Communist Chinese leader is in no position to
make such a comparison. The goals of American Civil War was to
liberate slaves and to promote freedom and equality, while
Communist China denies its people freedom and equality, he explained.</P>
      <P>While many people on the Chinese mainland drive luxurious
European cars, 240 million mainland Chinese still live under the
"abject poverty line" set by the United Nations, Chu pointed out.
The economic development in mainland China has resulted in a wide gap
between the rich and the poor. "Is there equality on the Chinese
mainland?" he asked.</P>
      <P>There is a clear similarity between Abraham Lincoln's idea "of
the people, by the people, and for the people" and Dr. Sun Yat-sen's
idea in his "Three Principles of the People," Chu said, adding that
"Therefore, only the Republic of China is in a position to promote
freedom and equality for the Chinese people," he stressed. (by Ed

    <HEADLINE>ROC TO HOST 1998 MATHEMATICS OLYMPIAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 21 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China has won the right to
host the 39th Mathematics Olympiad in July next year, the Ministry of
Education (MOE) reported on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>This is the first time that the ROC has been granted the right
to sponsor an international Olympic academic contests, the ministry
said, adding that more than 1,000 hopefuls from 85 countries and
areas are expected to take part in the extravaganza.</P>
      <P>Chen Chao-ti, dean of College of Science of National Taiwan
Normal University, who has many times headed local students to
participate in international academic contests, said it's a hard-won
achievement for Taiwan to host the event.</P>
      <P>It takes 40 years for Romania, which hosted the first Mathematics
Olympiad back in 1959, to win the right to host the contest again in
1999, Chen said. Among Asian countries, Japan has not had the
opportunity to host the event, while South Korea has been picked to
sponsor the contest in the year 2000.</P>
      <P>Taiwan began to take part in the annual mathematics competition
for senior high school students in 1992. Because of the outstanding
performance of ROC students and the strenuous efforts of the domestic
mathematics community, Taiwan has managed to win the hosting right,
Chen said.</P>
      <P>Over the past six years, Taiwan on average ranked 10th in the
annual two-day contest. The best record was seen in 1993 when Taiwan
garnered the fifth place.</P>
      <P>Chen said the contestants are usually senior high school students
with special talent in mathematics. The test items are consistently
very difficult and mainly aimed at testing the participants'
creativity and logic thinking ability.</P>
      <P>The contest is purely an academic event completely immune to
politics, Chen said, adding that mainland China is expected to send
a team to take part in the 1998 Olympiad.</P>
      <P>Chen said the MOE and the National Science Council will
jointly earmark NT$37.2 million (US$1.25 million) to finance the
event, while National Taiwan Normal University will be
responsbile for organizing the contest.</P>
      <P>A special committee composed of mathematicians from Academia
Sinica and National Tsinghua University will be formed to select
entries to be recommended by experts from around the world.
Contestants will be required to solve six questions
within two days.</P>
      <P>The Mathematics Olympiad was held for the first time 1959, with
the participation of only four countries -- Czechslovakia, Poland,
East Germany and host Romania. After more than 30 years of
development, the number of participating countries has greatly
increased.</P>
      <P>There are also international physics and chemistry Olympiads,
but they are held separately on different dates, with different
participating countries.</P>

      <P>The Philippine peso appeared to be much
stronger than other currencies in Southeast Asia during the past week
vis-a-vis the US dollar despite the country's relatively small US
dollar reserves, the head of the Philippine Central Bank said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking during a Legislative-Executive Development Advisory

legislators and representatives of the business community, Central
Bank Governor Gabriel C. Singson said, "The peso has held its ground
better than many currencies in the region despite having the smallest
dollar reserves."</P>
      <P>As of Sept. 30 this year, the country's Gross International

at US$75.7 billion; followed by Thailand, US$38.6 billion; Malaysia,

      <P>"I believe the Philippine economy is holding up reasonably well
during a period of tremendous financial stress in the region.
Provided that prudent financial policies are maintained and
structural reforms are sustained, the economy will be able to recover
rapidly from the current crisis," Singson said.</P>
      <P>Singson said on the basis of "sustained good underlying economic
fundamentals," the recovery of the peso is "already long overdue" but

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  21  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two former Macau-based Kuomintang (KMT)
officials were cleared of espionage charges on Tuesday by the Taiwan
High Court and were immediately released on bail.</P>
      <P>The court ruled that there is no positive and reinforcing
evidence other than the defendants' confessions to connect Wu Taoming
and Chang Lu-chung with charges of spying for mainland China.</P>
      <P>Although the defendants confessed to the investigators earlier in
the proceedings, a panel of three judges said that since Chang and Wu
backed away from the confessions during the trial and since it is
well-provided in ROC law that defendants should not be convicted
solely on a confession alone, there was insufficient evidence for a
conviction.</P>
      <P>Even if the defendants did pass to Beijing information they
learned at the KMT 14th National Congress as the prosecution claimed,
they could not be convicted, because information released by the KMT,
a political group, is not considered "state secret" and is thus not
protected by the espionage law.</P>
      <P>After handing down the judgment, the court freed Wu and Chang on
bonds of NT$200,000 and NT$100,000 (US$6,666 and US$3,333),
respectively and prohibited them from leaving the country, pending
the possibility of an appeal by the prosecution in Taiwan's Supreme
Court.</P>
      <P>Prosecutor Chang Ching-yun, who led the government's case against
Wu and Chang, and Investigation Bureau official Chang Fu-hsiung, who
conducted the inquiry into the case, expressed surprise at the
not-guilty verdict, but refused to say whether they would appeal.</P>
      <P>Huang Yao-yu, KMT director general for mainland operations, would
not comment on the judgment, although another senior KMT official who
spoke on condition of anonymity said that his party never had any
intention of prosecuting the case but that law enforcement
authorities had insisted on bringing the case to court.</P>
      <P>Wu, alias Ng Wah, and Chang, were KMT officials posted in Macau
who were arrested on Feb. 27 in Taiwan by the Investigation Bureau on
charges of leaking "military secrets" to Beijing, including a list of
KMT secret agents operating in mainland China.</P>
      <P>The two defendants were jubilant at Thursday's ruling, saying
that the court has vindicated their claims of innocence.</P>

      <P>President Jiang Zemin of mainland China
is in no position to compare cross-strait relations with the Civil
War of the United States, James Chu, minister of the Overseas
Chinese Affairs Commission, said here Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Jiang, who is scheduled to visit the United States on Oct.
26-Nov. 2, was interviewed in Shanghai by the Washington Post on Oct.
17. In the interview, he quoted from Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg
Address and compared the relations between Taiwan and mainland China
with the situations of the American civil war.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a ceremony marking the 45th Overseas Chinese Day in
Taipei, Chu said the Communist Chinese leader is in no position to
make such a comparison. The goals of American Civil War was to
liberate slaves and to promote freedom and equality, while
Communist China denies its people freedom and equality, he explained.</P>
      <P>While many people on the Chinese mainland drive luxurious
European cars, 240 million mainland Chinese still live under the
"abject poverty line" set by the United Nations, Chu pointed out.
The economic development in mainland China has resulted in a wide gap
between the rich and the poor. "Is there equality on the Chinese
mainland?" he asked.</P>
      <P>There is a clear similarity between Abraham Lincoln's idea "of
the people, by the people, and for the people" and Dr. Sun Yat-sen's
idea in his "Three Principles of the People," Chu said, adding that
"Therefore, only the Republic of China is in a position to promote
freedom and equality for the Chinese people," he stressed. (by Ed

    <HEADLINE>US ASSURES TAIPEI OF NO HARM FROM DIALOGUE WITH BEIJING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 21 (CNA)
(By Debbie Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The US authorities have repeatedly assured
Taipei that the upcoming meeting between US President Bill Clinton
and his mainland China counterpart, Jiang Zemin, will not harm the
Republic of China's interests, Foreign Affairs Minister Jason Hu said
on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Hu, who has just ended a 14-month stint as the ROC's de facto
ambassador to the United States and returned this week to Taipei to
assume his new post, said that even if Taiwan is mentioned in the
Oct. 29 Clinton-Jiang summit in Washington, D.C., he doesn't believe
it will lead to any break in Washington's present policy toward
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"A basic understanding between Taipei and Washington is that the
US will not sacrifice Taiwan's interests in its engagement with
Beijing, and will not make any decision that might `surprise' our
government and people," Hu said in answer to an inquiry by Legislator
Chien Hsi-chieh from the opposition Democratic Progressive Party at a
Legislative Yuan plenary session.</P>
      <P>Hu said as far as he knows, Washington would rather not talk
about Taiwan during the summit, while Beijing is believed to want to
raise the issue.</P>
      <P>Even if Beijing insists on talking about Taiwan, Hu said he
believes that both the US and mainland China will try their utmost
during the summit to "seek consensus in their differences," so as to
enhance mutual understanding, which will lead to better relations
between the two sides.</P>
      <P>He added that if Washington and Beijing can "reach consensus in
their differences," relations between Washington and Taipei will
actually be improved.</P>
      <P>He reiterated Taipei's stance of seeking a parallel existence
with Beijing on an equal footing in the international community, and
of the desire for continuing active and cordial relations between the
ROC and the United States.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HIGH COURT UPHOLDS VINCENT SIEW'S INNOCENCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tainan,  southern  Taiwan, Oct. 21 (CNA)
(By Debbie Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Tainan branch of the
Taiwan High Court on Tuesday rejected an appeal filed by former
legislative election candidate Trong Chai which accused Premier
Vincent Siew, Chai's rival in the 1995 legislative elections in
Chiayi City, of violating the Election and Recall Law.</P>
      <P>The judges rejected Chai's appeal, saying that Siew, who narrowly
beat Chai to win the single seat in Chiayi City, was innocent.</P>
      <P>Chiayi City was one of the most hotly contested constituencies
around the island in the 1995 legislative elections.</P>
      <P>Siew, representing the ruling Kuomintang (KMT), defeated Chai,
who represented the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), in
the elections to mark the first triumph in legislative elections for
the KMT in Chiayi City, which is a stronghold of DPP and other
non-KMT forces.</P>
      <P>Chai, a former politics professor in the US, was elected the only
legislator representing Chiayi City in 1992 elections.</P>
      <P>Following this setback, Chai filed a lawsuit with the Chiayi
District Court against Siew, accusing Siew of disseminating
misleading propaganda against him which led to his eventual defeat.</P>
      <P>The Tainan High Court upheld the verdict handed down by judges of
the Chiayi District Court stating that Siew was innocent, citing the
fact that all Siew's "propaganda" against Chai was later verified as
truth rather than fabrication.</P>
      <P>The "propaganda" included Siew's assertions that Chai had a NT$1
million investment in a local cable television network and a
US$50,000 investment in a motel in the United States, as well as
holding a position as a professor at a US university.</P>
      <P>Although Chai's appeal was rejected, he has the right to
reappeal, the judges said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>M'LAND CHINA EXPERIENCING SEXUAL AWAKENING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct. 21 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Prostitution, once almost extinct at the
height of Communist control, is now booming in most mainland Chinese
cities and towns and the competition for clients can be fierce,
according to a report by the mass circulation newspaper The Sydney
Morning Herald.</P>
      <P>In a dispatch from Beijing on Tuesday, the daily's correspondent
David Lague reported sex has caught on as a marketing tool in the
once prudish mainland China as economic reforms overlap with an
increasingly liberal society.</P>
      <P>Salespeople are taking advantage of the increasing sexual
awareness of modern mainland Chinese only a generation after Maoist
propaganda attempted to suppress eroticism among the masses, the
daily said.</P>
      <P>In presenting a paper at an international population conference
in Beijing last week, a researcher at the Shanghai Academy of Social
Sciences said although the ultra-leftists of the Cultural Revolution
had branded sex sinful, this attitude is now fading fast, the daily
reported.</P>
      <P>"Along with the popularization of scientific knowledge on sex and
opening up of sex culture, sex is no longer synonymous with dirt,
obscene ideas or animal desire," the researcher said.</P>
      <P>In a survey of 911 couples in Shanghai, the researcher said, 62.5
percent of women aged between 50 and 64 had never heard of or
experienced orgasm but only 24.4 percent of women aged 30 or under
gave the same answer.</P>
      <P>"Among the older women, 61.7 percent stated that they had rarely
experienced any pleasure in recent sexual life, if at all, while only
19.3 percent of the younger women made the same statement," he said.
The daily said younger people in mainland China are expected to be
more responsive to sales campaigns with sexual themes.</P>
      <P>In mainland China as elsewhere, there is now a debate about the
exploitation of human sexuality, particularly when it dwells on the
female form, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>For some mainland Chinese, the loosening of social and political
controls over sex and sensuality has transformed their lifestyles and
the atmosphere of many towns and cities, the daily said.</P>
      <P>It is well known in Beijing that many gay men meet at Dongdan
park in the center of the city, although homosexuality is still not
readily accepted in the wider community, it said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AREA OF BETEL PALM CULTIVATION QUADRUPLED IN TAIWAN IN TEN YEARS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  21  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Compared to ten years ago, the area of
arable land given over to betel palm cultivation in Taiwan has
quadrupled to 56,581 hectares, producing 1.6 times more betel nut, at
160,000 tons, while the market value has trebled to NT$13.61 billion
(US$453.66 million) and its proportion of the total
agricultural\livestock sector has risen from 1.6 to 4.2 percent,
according to statistics issued on Tuesday by the Directorate General
of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>The crop from the betel palm, the betel nut, chewed mainly by
Taiwan's blue collar workers for its mild stimulant effect, has a
retail price of about NT$8 apiece on average, is about four times the
wholesale price.</P>
      <P>The data also shows that in 1995, about 10 percent of Taiwan's
population aged 15 and over chewed betel nut, about 1.6 percent fewer
than the previous year.</P>
      <P>However, the DGBAS pointed out that despite this downward trend
in the percentage of consumers, the incidence of oral cancer, widely
believed to be a disease related to the habit of betel nut chewing,
has risen, claiming the lives of 4.9 persons per 100,000 of the
population in 1996, an increase from the 1.4 persons per 100,000
recorded ten years ago.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's Taiyih Industrial Co. on Tuesday
struck a deal with Luminator Aircraft Products Co. of the United
States to jointly produce lighting systems for S-92 helicopters to be
made in Taiwan and other Asian countries, according to sources from
the Industrial Development Bureau (IDB).</P>
      <P>Taiyih Chairman Wu Chun-yih and Luminator Chairman John Hartzler
jointly inked the cooperative agreement Tuesday at the IDB, with IDB
Director General Wang Ya-kang witnessing.</P>
      <P>The Tainan-based Taiyih, which also maintains a large-scale
production outlet in mainland China, is one of the leading
manufacturers of motorbike and automobile parts in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Under the agreement, Taiyih will invest NT$100 million (US$3.3
million) in the joint venture for the production of various lights
for S-92 helicopters, including search, landing, glare shield,
utility and thunderstorm lights, while Luminator will transfer its
production know-how to Taiyih, IDB officials said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Aerospace Industry Development Corp. (AIDC) signed a
strategic alliance with the US-based Sikorsky Helicopter Corp., one
of the world's biggest manufacturers of helicopters, in mid-October
for industrial cooperation.</P>
      <P>Under the alliance, AIDC and Sikorsky will jointly develop in
Taiwan the technologically advanced cockpit section of the S-92
mid-sized transport helicopter.</P>
      <P>Other purposes of the cooperation include joint exploration of
the booming aerospace spare parts market in the Asian-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Commercial production of the 20-seat S-92 choppers, currently
being developed under concerted efforts from Taiwan, the United
States, Japan, Brazil, Spain and mainland China, is expected to begin
in 1999.</P>
      <P>The market of S-92s will reach 700 units in the next 20 years
worldwide, with Taiyih enjoying a sales share of US$200 million by
the year 2002, according to Sikorsky estimates.</P>
      <P>A study by Boeing predicted that production of passenger aircraft
will top some US$50 billion annually in the next several years, with
the market of interior decoration and facilities reaching US$1.2
billion, which includes a US$150 million market for lighting systems.</P>
      <P>Sikorsky, which maintains 45 sales operations worldwide, became
the 49th major multinational firm and first helicopter maker to sign
a strategic alliance with the ROC Ministry of Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the head of Taiyih said the cooperation with Luminator
will upgrade the company's levels of production toward aerospace
lights and lighting systems for railways and mass rapid transport
systems.</P>
      <P>Luminator has also authorized Taiyih as its sole agent in the
Asia-Pacific area for its advanced lighting/signal systems and night

    <HEADLINE>CZECH PRESIDENT BECOMES CAUTIOUS IN ENGAGING ROC: ENVOY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  22  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Czech President Vaclav Havel has become
more cautious in engaging the Republic of China under pressure from
Czech business people hoping to enter the vast mainland Chinese
market, Hsieh Hsin-ping, the ROC's chief representative to the
Central European country said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at a Legislative Yuan committee meeting, Hsieh
said although the Czech Republic attaches great importance to
Taiwan's economic strength and political democratization, it also
sets its eyes on the immense mainland market.</P>
      <P>After some Czech business heavyweights expressed their
dissatisfaction with Havel's friendly policy and gestures toward
Taiwan, Hsieh said, the Czech president has become more cautious in
dealing with affairs related to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"We should face up to this phenomenon and step up efforts to work
out reciprocal cooperative projects to sustain friendly ties between
the two countries," Hsieh told the lawmakers.</P>
      <P>For instance, Hsieh said, the government should encourage
state-run enterprises to cooperate with the Czech Republic's Skoda
Heavy Machinery Co.</P>
      <P>"By so doing, we can help Havel convince Czech businessmen and
politicians of the benefit in developing closer ties with the ROC,"
Hsieh noted.</P>
      <P>The ROC's de facto ambassador to Prague said the Czech Republic
keenly welcomes Taiwan investment. Hualon Textile Co., one of
Taiwan's largest textile companies, has set up a fabric production
facility in the Czech Republic, and the state-run Aerospace Industry
Development Corp. has signed a cooperative accord with the
Prague-based Aero Vodochody Co. on joint production of small
aircraft.</P>
      <P>"These two examples indicate that there is ample room for the
growth of trade and economic cooperation between our two countries,"
Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>The Czech Republic recognizes Beijing but maintains friendly ties
with Taiwan. Vice President Lien Chan managed to make a private visit
to the Czech Republic in June 1995.</P>
      <P>Asked about the possibility of President Lee Teng-hui visiting
Prague, Hsieh said he has never presented a formal request for such a
visit, but added that the Czech government's basic stance is that it
would not stop any person from taking a vacation on its territory.</P>
      <P>The ROC opened a representative office in Prague in January 1992,
while the Czech representative office in Taipei became operational in
November 1993. The Czech Republic was the first Central European
country to set up a representative office in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Havel, a poet-turned-politician, has been friendly toward Taiwan.
His first wife, who died a few years ago, once visited Taipei.
Havel's second wife was scheduled to visit Taiwan earlier this month,
but canceled her travel plan at the last minute because of pressure
from Beijing.</P>
      <P>Havel once used his speech to the annual United Nations General
Assembly debate to deliver an appeal for Taiwan's bid to rejoin the
world body.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NT DEPRECIATION MAY RESULT IN BIGGER TRADE GAP WITH US</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Oct. 22 (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The New Taiwan dollar's depreciation in
recent weeks may result in Taiwan scoring a record high trade surplus
with the United States, according to the US Department of Commerce.</P>
      <P>The newest statistics released by the Commerce Department show
that Taiwan posted a trade surplus of US$7.87 billion with the United
States in the first eight months of this year, making it America's
sixth-largest source of trade surplus after Japan, mainland China,
Germany, Canada and Mexico.</P>
      <P>The figure reflects a 9.1 percent increase over the same period
of 1996 and a sharp contrast to the sluggish performance by the other
three Asian dragon economies -- Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea.</P>
      <P>The Commerce Department attributed Taiwan's increased trade gap
with America to the economic recovery in both countries, which it
said has led to strong demand in the United States and booming
exports by Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The figure, though already a record high compared with those
contracted in the same period over the past eight years, may further
widen for September and October, due to the sharp depreciation of the
New Taiwan dollar against a robust US dollar in recent weeks,
observers said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan registered a record high trade imbalance of US$16 billion
with the United States in 1987, when the local currency stood around
35-40 against the greenback.</P>
      <P>The figure continued to narrow following the New Taiwan dollar's
gradual appreciation since 1990. Taiwan's trade gap with the United
States dropped by 50 percent during the period between 1989 and 1995.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TWO-WAY TRADE CONTINUES TO CLIMB</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 22 (CNA)
(By Debbie Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As of Oct. 18, Taiwan's two-way trade this
year amounted to US$187.31 billion, up 7.5 percent or US$13.9 billion
over the same period of the previous year, the Ministry of Finance
(MOF) reported Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan exported US$96.89 billion worth of merchandise between
Jan. 1 and Oct. 18 this year, while importing US$90.42 billion in
goods, leaving a trade surplus of US$6.47 billion in favor of the
island, according to officials from the MOF Department of Statistics.</P>
      <P>Exports in this period rose 5.1 percent or US$4.75 billion
compared to the same period of 1996, with imports climbing 10.2
percent or US$8.34 billion over the year-earlier level, the officials
noted.</P>
      <P>In the first half of October, Taiwan's exports soared 8.1 percent
to US$7.11 billion, while imports dropped 7.9 percent to US$6.11
billion, leaving the country a trade surplus of US$1 billion.</P>
      <P>The MOF officials attributed the continuing rise of exports to
the beginning of the peak season for electronics businesses, and the
sharp decrease in imports to a reduction in the amount of crude oil
and weaponry brought to the island this month.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT SPOKESMAN DENOUNCES DPP HEAD'S `THREE-LINKS' PROPOSAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  22  (CNA)
(By Debbie Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) spokesman Tsai Pi-huang
gave Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Hsu Hsin-liang a
good dressing-down on Wednesday for Hsu's proposal to conduct
negotiations on "three direct links" -- trade, postal and transport
-- with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Hsu made the proposal during a visit in Paris on Oct. 16, in
response to an offer by Beijing to hold bilateral dialogue focusing
on peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>DPP Public Relations chief Sissy Chen, who accompanied Hsu on his
trip, said the DPP is willing to shelve the sensitive sovereignty
issue and talk with Beijing on the establishment of postal, trade and
transport links between Taiwan and mainland China</P>
      <P>Tsai blasted Hsu's proposal, accusing him of "dancing to
Beijing's tune," and of being "ignorant of the danger to Taiwan
residents," adding that only a very few people in Taiwan would agree
to such unconditional links.</P>
      <P>The proposal also reveals Hsu's "limited" style, which shows his
inability to be a national leader, Tsai commented.</P>
      <P>Citing the major factors underlining the risk to Taiwan in
opening the three direct links with the mainland at present, Tsai
noted Beijing's refusal to renounce the use of force against Taiwan,
the fact that such links would involve not only economic, but
political and security issues, and the fact that Taiwan residents'
common wish of opening direct air links with the mainland is subject
to certain conditions.</P>
      <P>Participation of government officials from both sides of the
Taiwan Strait is required to talk about any kind of links, Tsai
noted, pointing out that such talks have been impossible so far
because of Beijing's insistence that no talks can take place unless
Taipei accepts Beijing's "one country, two systems" arrangement, and
Taipei recognizes Beijing as the central government of all of China.</P>
      <P>Before Beijing ends its hostility toward Taipei and before Taiwan
gets concrete assurances of its security, talks on "three direct
links" will only create a false sense of rapprochement across the
strait, confuse the international community and risk a lessening of
Taiwan's vigilance, Tsai warned.</P>
      <P>From the points of view of national interests, security and the
people's common wish, the best course of cross-strait action for the
moment should be a resumption of talks to seek solutions to technical
problems arising from increased exchanges across the strait, and to
raise the issue of finding ways to bring cross-strait hostility to an
end, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CLINTON-JIANG SUMMIT UNLIKELY TO BRING NEW STATEMENTS ON TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  21 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US President Bill Clinton is unlikely
to make any new statements on the subject of Taiwan when he meets
with his communist Chinese counterpart, Jiang Zemin, at their Oct. 29
summit in Washington, Harvey Feldman, senior fellow at the Heritage
Foundation, said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Feldman told the conservative think tank's roundtable meeting for
the Asia-Pacific press in Washington that he believes Jiang will
raise the issue of US relations with Taiwan at the Washington summit.</P>
      <P>More specifically, he said, Jiang is likely to call for an end to
US arms sales to Taiwan, ask the United States not to support the
"splitist" forces in Taiwan, and urge the United States to "agree" to
Beijing's claim that "Taiwan is part of China" instead of merely
acknowledging the claim without contradicting it.</P>
      <P>Feldman, a retired US foreign service officer who had served as
the State Department's country director for the Republic of China on
Taiwan before Washington shifted diplomatic recognition from Taipei
to Beijing in 1979, said that he doesn't believe the United States
will change its position on the subject of Taiwan. "In fact, my
understanding is we already assured the ROC that nothing is going to
change, as far as US policy is concerned," he said.</P>
      <P>Despite Beijing's pressure, the Clinton administration has
basically told the mainland Chinese leadership that the United States
will not sign a fourth joint communique on the subject of Taiwan at
the summit, Feldman said, adding that Jiang can instead expect a
reiteration that the United States will follow the "traditional
one-China policy."</P>
      <P>On whether Taiwan will be allowed to join the World Trade
Organization (WTO) ahead of mainland China, Feldman said the issue is
not solely up to the United States to decide.</P>
      <P>The United States has adopted a nominal position since the Bush
administration that it will not hold Taiwan's entry to the WTO
hostage to mainland China's accession. However, there is an apparent
consensus among WTO members that Taiwan will have to wait until
mainland China gets in, he said.</P>
      <P>Feldman pointed out that the United States has not yet reached
agreement with Taiwan on its offer regarding WTO accession, and that
movement on this front has been "very, very slow."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Compal Electronics Inc., a publicly listed
adapter-manufacturing company in Taiwan, said on Wednesday it has
resolved issues related to a shipment of defective AC adapters to
US-based Dell Computer Corp.</P>
      <P>Compal made the statement after a CNA dispatch from Washington
said Dell is voluntarily recalling AC adapters supplied with its
Latitude LM notebook computers and port replicators worldwide.</P>
      <P>A Dell spokesman was quoted as telling the CNA that the adapters
being recalled were all made in Taiwan by Compal Electronics Inc. He
said Dell has received 111 reports of the adapters' connector pins
breaking off from the adapter and remaining in the power cord, posing
a shock hazard, but that no injuries have been reported.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the report, Compal said the defective AC adapters
were shipped to the United States a few months ago. "We have already
supplied Dell with non-defective replacement adapters and no faulty
adapters have been found in any subsequent shipments," a company
spokesman said.</P>
      <P>The spokesman admitted that Compal has lost slightly more than
US$1 million for the defective shipment, adding that the loss will be
listed in the company's financial report for the third quarter of
this year.</P>
      <P>The recall report caused dramatic falls in prices for Compal
stock and other related electronics issues in early-morning trading
on the Taiwan Stock Exchange, although it managed to recover some
ground in the late session.</P>
      <P>Dell is recalling the adapters in the United States and
throughout the world through its resellers. The black AC adapters are
four inches long by 2.25 inches wide and have one attached cord and
one detachable power cord.</P>
      <P>Dell sold the AC adapters with the Latitude LM notebook computers
and port replicators, but they were also sold separately in the US
for about US$39.</P>
      <P>Dell said it is recalling the faulty adapters in response to
concerns raised by the US Consumer Product Safety Commission and
urged its customers to immediately stop using the defective adapters
and contact the company to receive a free replacement.</P>

(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A survey released Tuesday indicated
anti-depressants are likely responsible for sexual dysfunction and
sleep disturbances in more than one million Canadians.</P>
      <P>The survey of 1,300 people across Canada suggested that about
three million Canadians suffer from depression and one-third of them
seek professional help.</P>
      <P>"If patients are asked if they have a sexual problem, studies
have quoted between 50 and 90 percent of men and women taking
anti-depressants as saying they have sexual problems," said Dr.
Pierre Assalian, the executive director of the Canadian Sex Research
Forum.</P>
      <P>The study indicated that Canadians taking anti-depressants are
three times more likely than the general public to report that they
"always" experience a sex-related problem.</P>
      <P>Those problems range from lack of desire or interest in sex to
difficulty obtaining and maintaining an erection. Assalian noted that
the study suggested that the overwhelming majority -- more than 90
percent -- of patients on anti-depressants did not realize their
medication was contributing to their sleep and sex problems.</P>
      <P>The highest rates of depression occur among adults aged 20 to 57.
Females have higher rates of clinical depression than males by a
ratio of two to one.</P>
      <P>The survey indicated that 6 percent of the general public say
they "always" experience at least one sex problem and have trouble
sleeping at least once a week.</P>

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The currency crisis in Southeast Asia is
likely to hit Australia's US$2.2 billion educational exports, the
mass circulation newspaper The Australian said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The currency crisis started in Thailand and spread to Indonesia,
Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines and South Korea.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan currency has also fallen to a ten-year low this week.</P>
      <P>Australian universities are worried that some international
students from Southeast Asia may suffer financial hardships during
their study in Australia.</P>
      <P>While feedback is still sketchy at this stage, many schools are
monitoring the situation, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>The daily said any downturn in enrollments would be a blow for
Australian universities, because many of them are desperate to lure
more overseas students to compensate for cuts in the federal
education budget.</P>
      <P>The number of foreign students, particularly from Asia, has also
shown signs of declining because of the racial debate sparked by
Independent Member of Parliament Pauline Hanson.</P>
      <P>The daily reported that the Pauline Hanson-inspired race debate

US dollar in recent months.</P>
      <P>The daily quoted Denis Blight, chief executive of IDP Australia,

    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct. 22 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The currency and stock market crisis now
hitting East and Southeast Asian countries is likely to also affect
Japan, mainland China, South Korea and Australia, according to a
market analyst.</P>
      <P>Simon Ogus, executive director for Asian economies with the
investment bank SBC Warburg in Hong Kong, said the Asian crisis will
depress global growth by about a tenth next year, representing
foregone activity of US$118 billion -- including about US$3 billion
in Australia.</P>
      <P>As investors continued a big sell-off in some regional markets
Tuesday, Ogus said the crisis was set to go deeper and wider.</P>
      <P>He said the epicenter of the economic earthquake -- Southeast
Asia -- could no longer expect to escape with a mere slowdown and was
now heading for a "full-blown recession and a full-blown banking
crisis."</P>
      <P>He said overall the slowdown would cut the expected rate of
global economic growth by 0.4 of a percentage point next year or
about one-tenth of the growth forecast by the International Monetary
Fund.</P>
      <P>He estimated growth in Australia would be slashed by 0.8 of a
percentage point next year.</P>
      <P>He said investors were continuing to desert the region because
Asian governments were failing to address their problems credibly.</P>
      <P>Ogus predicted the biggest economies of Asia -- Japan, South
Korea and mainland China -- would suffer a market slowdown because of
the current crisis in Southeast Asia.</P>
      <P>He said that the economy of North Asia most vulnerable to
contagion from Southeast Asia is South Korea, which is suffering a
wave of corporate bankruptcies that are in turn damaging bank balance
sheets.</P>
      <P>"Korea is a big boy; if it spreads to Korea, it spreads to China,
and the world has a problem," Ogus said. Korea would be injured
because its exports to Southeast Asia would slow and because it would
lose money on loans to Southeast Asia.</P>
      <P>He said mainland China could be infected through two channels.
First demand for its exports will likely slow as Korea and Southeast
Asia buy less from it. Second, interest rates in Hong Kong will rise,
making it more expensive for mainland Chinese firms to raise funds.</P>
      <P>He said Japan is likely to see its economic growth next year
depressed by 0.6 of a percentage point, while growth in mainland
China was forecast to fall to 7-8 percent from the current 10
percent.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has become the latest hit with its currency and stock
markets falling after the Central Bank of China gave up defending the
New Taiwan dollar. Some analysts believe the Taiwan currency could
drop to NT$31 to one US dollar.</P>
      <P>Peter Clay, treasury strategist with ABN-Ambro in Sydney, warned
that Australia's current account could deteriorate markedly over the
coming year, with its deficit blowing out to 5 percent by mid-1998.</P>
      <P>He attributed the problem of Australia to the fallout of slow
growth in East and Southeast Asia because about 60 percent of its
exports now go to the region.</P>
      <P>As a result, he said, the Australian dollar is headed for a 5 to
10 percent depreciation.</P>
      <P>In Hong Kong, shares continued to sink as new worries emerged
about the cost of maintaining the peg of the Hong Kong dollar to the
US dollar, with the benchmark Hang Seng Index ending 4.4 percent
lower Tuesday.</P>
      <P>South Korea saw its currency fall further to 924.90 to one US
dollar Tuesday, a seven-year low.</P>
      <P>In Tokyo, the Nikkei Stock Average closed down 0.49 percent the
same day as the stock market reacted coolly to the Japanese
government's new economic stimulus package.</P>

    <HEADLINE>S'PORE BANKS AMONG THE STRONGEST IN ASEAN REGION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Oct. 22 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore banks are among the strongest
in the region in terms of size and capabilities compared to their
ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) counterparts, said
some local bankers and observers.</P>
      <P>They questioned the incentives for local banks to form alliances
or mergers with other financial institutions within the region, The
Straits Times reported Wednesday.</P>
      <P>These were some of the views of market players and observers in a
mixed reaction to Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong's remarks at
the East Asia Economic Summit held in Hong Kong last week.</P>
      <P>Goh had called for East Asian banks to form strategic alliances
among themselves to become strong regional financial institutions so
as to better tackle foreign competition.</P>
      <P>Besides getting banks to merge within national boundaries, they
could hold stakes in other banks within the region to produce
stronger regional banks, he added.</P>
      <P>In a positive reaction to Goh's call, a senior Singapore banker
said that strategic alliances among ASEAN banks would bring about
economies of scale and free up Singapore's scarce resources for
redeployment to other sectors.</P>
      <P>Local banks were not averse to the idea of strategic partnerships
with financial institutions in neighboring countries, the daily said.</P>
      <P>The report quoted a a Development Bank of Singapore (DBS)
spokesman as saying: "Part of DBS' strategy has been to seek out
expansion opportunities in the region, whether it is through the
opening of branches, establishing subsidiaries or entering into
strategic alliances.</P>
      <P>"Such alliances for us could take the form of marketing
arrangements, joint product developments and joint ventures."</P>
      <P>An Overseas Chinese Bank spokesman also said the bank would be
open to opportunities to form cross-border alliances when the timing
and situation are right, although it did not have any such
arrangements to do so now.</P>
      <P>At the other end of the scale, however, market observers not too
keen on the idea felt that the only tangible benefits that would be
derived would be those of a larger size and greater market access, as
Singapore banks are already among the strongest in ASEAN.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, access to other markets will come about eventually
with the liberalization in accordance with the World Trade
Organization guidelines, they pointed out.</P>
      <P>Hence, such alliances may not do much to boost Singapore banks'
efforts to become major Asian financial institutions, they said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign Minister Jason Hu said on
Wednesday the chances are slim that Washington and Beijing will sign
a fourth communique in the coming summit between US President Bill
Clinton and mainland China's President Jiang Zemin.</P>
      <P>Hu said the possibility of a fourth communique is very remote,
adding that Washington has repeatedly assured Taipei that the
Clinton-Jiang meeting, slated for later this month, will not hurt
Taiwan's interests.</P>
      <P>Hu told the CNA that Washington has made it clear that the US
side will not raise the Taiwan issue during the meeting and that if
the mainland Chinese side touches on the issue, Beijing will be asked
to subject its wording to the existing limit, under which the US
acknowledges Beijing's claim that Taiwan is a part of China, without
actually agreeing with it.</P>
      <P>He refused to confirm whether ROC National Security Council
Secretary General Ting Mao-shih had exchanged opinions with US State
Department officials on the summit during an August visit to New
York.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Jan Jyh-horng, head of the Department of Research and
Planning under the cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council, called on
the people of Taiwan not to be influenced by Beijing's propaganda and
expressed the belief that Washington will not be manipulated by
Beijing in the upcoming meeting.
 Asked when will be an appropriate time for the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait to rekindle talks, Jan said the doors to a resumption
of cross-strait negotiations are always open, but he added that
Taiwan will not reopen talks with the mainland if Beijing refuses to
drop its insistence on such talks taking place under its "one China"
formula.</P>
      <P>He said Beijing's insistence on its version of "one China"
totally contradicts the consensus reached in a 1995 meeting between
Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation and the mainland's Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait, under which the two sides
agreed to interpret the "one China" principle on their own terms.</P>
      <P>Questioned on whether Taiwan and mainland China will resume talks
in February as President Lee Teng-hui intimated to a group of
Japanese reporters last week, Jan said Lee was only trying to say
that next spring might be the proper time.</P>
      <P>According to Jan, a number of countries, including the US, have
expressed the hope that the two sides can reopen talks as soon as
possible.</P>

the Ministry of Economic Affairs, on Wednesday introduced Taiwan
SMEs and Small- and Medium-Sized Industries (SMIs) at an ASEAN
workshop being held in Singapore.</P>
      <P>The three-day Workshop on Promoting ASEAN SME/SMI Through Private
Sector Institutions was jointly sponsored by ASEAN and the United
Nations Development Program (UNDP). Some 50 delegates from ASEAN
countries attended the workshop which opened on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Ni, who was on an overnight visit, was the only speaker from the
ROC to address the workshop on the development and promotion of
SME/SMIs in Taiwan and the role of the government and business
associations.</P>
      <P>Ni pointed out that SMEs are the foundation of the ROC's economic

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN STUDENTS ALLOWED TO STUDY AT 73 MAINLAND UNIVERSITIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  22 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's senior high school graduates can
from now on legally study at 73 selected mainland Chinese
universities and colleges, according to a new set of regulations
unveiled by the Ministry of Education (MOE) on Wednesday governing
accreditation of academic degrees conferred by universities or
colleges in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Under the regulations, the ministry will recognize degrees
conferred by schools on the approved list if the recipients have
reported their study plans to the MOE in advance.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the ministry said, certain degrees conferred by
some communist ideology-oriented departments at the listed schools
will still not be accredited.</P>
      <P>Minister of Education Wu Jin said the ministry has considered a
combination of factors in preparing the list of approved schools,
including academic levels, teaching facilities, the government's
mainland policy and manpower planning guidelines, as well as the
living conditions in various mainland areas.</P>
      <P>Teacher-training universities are excluded from the list because
mainland China still focuses heavily on ideological indoctrination
when training its teachers, Wu said, adding that schools of Western
medicine are also excluded, in line with Taiwan's manpower planning
policy which considers Taiwan to have sufficient supplies of trained
doctors. In addition, only three mainland schools of
traditional Chinese medicine managed to make the list.</P>
      <P>Among the listed schools are Beijing University, Chinese People's
University, Qinghua University, North China Jiaotong University,
Nankai University, Nanjing University, Xiamen University, Shandong
University, Fudan University, Beijing University of Traditional
Chinese Medicine and Beijing Foreign Studies University.</P>
      <P>In fact, many Taiwan students have been traveling to the mainland
to receive tertiary education since long before the government
released its approved list.</P>
      <P>Mainland academic degrees conferred on Taiwan students before
Sept. 18, 1992 when the Statute Governing the Relations Between the
People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area was implemented, will
still not be recognized, Wu said, adding that those who received
mainland degrees between Sept. 18, 1992 and Oct. 22, 1997 will be
accredited so long as they can pass a qualifying exam in no more than
two attempts.</P>
      <P>From Wednesday, no mainland degrees offered to local students by
schools not on the approved list will be accredited.</P>
      <P>Wu also announced that the government has decided to open local
graduate institutes to mainland Chinese college and university
graduates.</P>
      <P>He said his ministry will coordinate with the Mainland Affairs
Council, which charts Taiwan's policy on mainland China, in drafting
regulations to govern mainland college graduates intending to pursue
master's or doctoral degrees in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wu said the ministry will only formulate a legal framework,
leaving local universities to decide whether or not and how to
recruit mainland graduate students.</P>
      <P>Responding to Wu's announcement, Tamkang University, which has
maintained close ties with several mainland universities, said it
plans to implement a cross-strait exchange program for graduate
students.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Hugh deposits of natural resources such as
granite, lying beneath Galumpang, Buol-Tolitoli regency, Central
Sulawesi, could be mined for at least 700 years.</P>
      <P>The Indonesian Observer quoted Gumyadi, the regent of
Buol-Tolitoli, as saying that the latest mining research found that
the granite deposits beneath the regency will last hundreds of years,
as long as the mining companies and the residents take care of the
environment.</P>
      <P>According to Gumyadi, PT Mayorindo Granit, a national mining
company based in Jakarta, has found a huge fossilized granite
structure measuring 1,250 meters by 300 meters, five meters beneath
the surface.</P>
      <P>In addition to the national mining companies, geologists from
Malaysia are now exploring the granite deposits of Galumpang.</P>
      <P>They described the fossilized granite deposits as each being more
than a kilometer long and spread across a wide area from the north to
the south," the regent said.</P>
      <P>Other mining companies, he said, are now intending to open up
granite mining areas. A company led by former director of Garuda
Indonesia, R.A.J. Lumenta, has confirmed an investment of 30 billion
rupiah to build a granite rock processing plant, capable of handling
300 cubic meters per month, in Galumpang.</P>
      <P>Gumyadi said granite mining will become one of the biggest
contributors to the local economy.</P>
      <P>"I am optimistic that the granite deposits here are very
promising for the future," he added.</P>
      <P>The granite market in Europe today is in good condition, while
domestically, a square meter of granite rocks is priced at 600,000
rupiah, ten times more expensive than marble rocks.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Russia, followed by mainland China and
Turkey, were the world's fastest growing tourist destinations last
year in terms of increased number of tourist arrivals, the World
Tourism Organization reported in Istanbul Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The organization, which is holding its general assembly meeting
in Istanbul, reported in its publication "Tourism Highlights 1996"
that in 1996 some 14.59 million tourists visited Russia, the world's
14th biggest tourism destination, a 57.49 percent jump from 1995.</P>
      <P>The number of tourist arrivals in mainland China, the world's
sixth leading travel destination, rose 13.63 percent in 1996 to 22.77

    <HEADLINE>DEVALUATION OF NT DOLLAR TO HAVE LITTLE IMPACT ON RETAIL PRICES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  22  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The devaluation of the New Taiwan dollar
will have little impact on domestic retail prices as Taiwan's
economic fundamentals remain healthy, according to the Directorate
General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>The DGBAS cited steady price levels of agricultural and
industrial raw materials, the relative appreciation of the NT dollar
against the German and Japanese currencies, and a decline in the per
unit labor cost in the industrial manufacturing sector.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS said in a press release Wednesday that according to the
macroeconomic pattern it has charted for Taiwan, retail prices will
rise by between 0.5 percent and 0.6 percent for each incremental
decrease of NT$1 against the greenback. However, this formula is
valid only on condition that other major currencies remain steady
against the US dollar.</P>
      <P>The exchange rate of the NT dollar against the US dollar has
dropped more than NT$1 since Oct. 17, when the Central Bank of China
abandoned its strategy of intervening to prop up the local currency.</P>
      <P>However, the impact on local retail prices will be partially
offset by the steady prices of imported agricultural and industrial
raw materials, which dipped by 5.5 percent in the January-September
period, and the 3.6 percent decline in the per unit labor cost of
industrial output. That decline is due to a 6.7 percent growth in
productivity over the first seven months of this year and a relative
low increase of 3.1 percent in wages.</P>
      <P>The NT dollar's appreciation against deutsche mark and yen -- by
9.3 percent and 13.3 percent, respectively, in the first nine months
of this year -- will also cushion the negative impacts, given Germany
and Japan's combined 30 percent market share of Taiwan's imports.</P>
      <P>Theoretically, devaluation of the local currency will drive up
the price of imports and raise retail prices. Currently, however,
consumer goods account for only about 10 percent of Taiwan's total
imports, and 6.6 percent of the island's consumption volume, while
raw materials account for more than 70 percent of imports. Thus, the
DGBAS predicted that local consumers will feel the pinch of price
hikes, if any, sometime between two to seven months after the
readjusted exchange rates went into effect.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS blamed the recent Southeast Asian financial crises for
the 10.2 percent devaluation of the NT dollar since the beginning of
this year. The decline is similar to that experienced by the
Singapore dollar but lower than the 33.8 percent loss suffered by the
Thai baht, 23.2 percent decrease of the Philippine peso and 34.5
percent dip of the Indonesian rupiah.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 22 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan exports totaled US$89.78 billion in
the first nine months of this year, while imports totaled US$84.31
billion in the same period, recording a trade surplus of US$5.47
billion, the Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>BOFT officials said that Taiwan's exports between January and
September relied mostly on heavy industry and chemical industry
products, as well as on light industry products. Electronics,
information and telecommunications products formed the bulk of
exports, showing steady growth, while steel, optical instruments and
basic metals and basic metal products also grew rapidly.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's steel, semiconductor and computer companies have
continued to expand their production capacities since July 1996,
which has inspired the growth of the manufacturing industry and has
helped the increase in exports.</P>
      <P>Exports of other light industry products grew by only 3.4 percent
in the nine-month period. This low growth was attributed to a decline
in labor-intensive products, such as toys, furniture, shoes, pottery
and porcelain, due to fierce competition from Southeast Asia and
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Exports of agricultural and processed agricultural products have
been affected by the foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) epidemic in March,
with processed agricultural products declining by 34 percent and
agricultural products also dropping by 19.1 percent.</P>
      <P>In terms of countries and regions, Taiwan registered a trade
surplus of US$19.21 billion with Hong Kong in the first nine months
of this year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's exports to Japan registered negative growth of 13.3
percent in the same period, while imports grew by 3.9 percent. The
negative growth was attributed to the decline of machinery equipment
exports by 13.6 percent, while the FMD outbreak also took a toll on
Taiwan's pork exports to Japan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's imports of Japanese parts and components meanwhile
continued double digit growth, further widening the trade deficit,
while Taiwan's exports to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) recorded only 6.8 percent growth and an increase of 22.0
percent in imports, the result of the current financial crisis in
Southeast Asia.</P>

(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A high-ranking labor affairs official said
Wednesday that the government intends to step up efforts to prevent
foreign laborers from fleeing their jobs.</P>
      <P>Hsu Chieh-kwei, chairman of the Council of Labor Affairs, said
that as of the end of September, about 30,781 foreign workers in
Taiwan had gone AWOL from their jobs. The figure represented 12.4
percent of the total number of foreign workers in Taiwan, which stood
at some 248,000, he noted.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that 21,033 foreign workers who absconded from their
contracting place of employment have been located and detained, but
another 9,263 are still at large, posing a serious threat to social
order and disease control efforts.</P>
      <P>Hsu said his council is studying ways to reduce the number of
workers on the run, including raising the reward offered for tips
leading to the capture of illegal foreign laborers and imposing
heavier punishment for those who hire such workers. He made the
remarks in response to questions from lawmakers at the Legislative
Yuan, adding that the proposed measures would require approval from
the legislature.</P>
      <P>According to current regulations, any employer who is caught
hiring an illegal foreign worker faces up to six months in prison or
a fine of up to NT$90,000. If an employer is caught hiring two or
more foreign workers, the penalty will increase to a maximum of three
years in prison or a fine of up to NT$300,000.</P>
      <P>Hsu also mentioned a previously discussed plan to require
compulsory savings for foreign laborers as part of efforts to
dissuade them from running away. He said that he had met with his
counterparts from Thailand, the Philippines and other Southeast Asian
countries for talks on related issues.</P>

TAIWAN TO BE BRIEFED ON US-MAINLAND SUMMIT TALKS</P>
      <P>Taipei, Oct. 22 (CNA) Foreign Minister Jason Hu on Wednesday said
that the United States will brief Taiwan on the summit talks between
US President Bill Clinton and mainland China's President Jiang Zemin
shortly after their meeting on Oct. 29.</P>
      <P>"The US government will send someone who either participated in
the meeting or is at least very familiar with the details to brief
the ROC representative office in the US on the event," Hu said.</P>
      <P>"The ROC government, after being informed of the outcome of the
meeting, will decide whether any response is warranted," he said.</P>
      <P>The ROC and the US maintain both regular as well as non-regular
communication channels at various levels to facilitate the exchange
of information and opinions, Hu said, adding that there are no
barriers to communications between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Asked if he will reiterate the ROC's stance on the upcoming
US-mainland summit when meeting on Thursday with Daryl Johnson,
director general of the Taipei office of the American Institute in
Taiwan, Hu said that the US government has repeatedly given
assurances that its contacts with Beijing will not harm the interests
of Taiwan. "On this, we can feel their sincerity and good intention,"
Hu said.</P>
      <P>He added that he believes the possibility is slim that the
Washington-Beijing summit talks will bring any change to the current
US policy toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan hopes that Taipei-Washington ties will be basically
parallel to Washington-Beijing ties, Hu said, pointing out that when
it comes to regional security and certain other key policy issues,
the Americans prefer to work within a Washington-Beijing-Taipei
triangular framework.</P>
      <P>Hu also reaffirmed his determination to pursue pragmatic
diplomacy in order to increase Taiwan's profile in the international
community, saying that the ROC cannot survive without maintaining an
active presence in world affairs.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite huge losses resulting from overseas
oil exploration, the Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC) said Wednesday
that prospects have improved in recent years, with the success rate
of drilling ventures climbing from 13.8 percent to 25 percent.</P>
      <P>Responding to news reports that it had been misled by
international oil brokers and lost heavily in its overseas oil
exploration activities, the state-run CPC admitted that it has run up
a total of NT$14.8 billion (US$493.33 million) in non-recovered
investments over the past 27 years in 11 overseas joint ventures for
oil exploration.</P>
      <P>But the company also said that the results of its foreign
ventures are improving, with the success rate on an upward trend.</P>
      <P>Recent news reports claimed that a single botched investment in
an oil field in Kazakhstan, central Asia, incurred a US$15 million
loss for the CPC.</P>
      <P>However, the CPC said that as a state-run firm it is obliged to
follow government policy in exploring overseas prospects, such as its
investment in Kazakhstan. Citing an estimated oil reserve of 88
million barrels, a projected life span of 15 years and a potential
15.9 percent return on the investment annually, the company defended
the project as worthwhile. It said it proceeded with the investment
only after receiving a go-ahead from the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>The US$15 million funneled into the Kazakhstan project is the
start-up cost needed before the oil field can begin to produce, and
although there are differences between the CPC and its Kazakhstan
partners over management procedures, the company is trying to sort
those problems out, it said.</P>

imprisonment and fines of up to NT$100 million (US$3.28 million) if
caught dumping waste in Taiwan's exclusive economic zones, according
to a draft law passed by a Legislative Yuan committee on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Following the lead of neighboring countries which have either

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Over 100 blackface spoonbills, an
endangered species, will fly to a river in southern Taiwan for
winter, officials of the Council of Agriculture (COA) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>They said they have been able to pinpoint the whereabouts of the
usually elusive birds with the help of transmitters attached to them.</P>
      <P>COA Vice Chairman Lin Shiang-nung, COA Forestry Department Deputy
Director Lee San-wei and other officials made the remarks as they
inspected the mouth of Tsengwen Creek in Chihku Village, Tainan
County.</P>
      <P>Wildlife conservationists estimate that there are only about 300
blackface spoonbills left worldwide.</P>
      <P>Beginning in late September each year, large numbers of the
endangered migratory birds arrive at Tsengwen Creek for winter, where
they remain until March or April. As a major habitat for the rare
species, the creek has become a focus of attention for international
wildlife conservation groups.</P>
      <P>To better understand the behavioral patterns and natural habitat
of the blackface spoonbill, the COA has cooperated with Japanese
ornithological societies in using transmitters to trace their
movements.</P>
      <P>COA officials said that the government will also appropriate
money in the next fiscal year to establish a blackface spoonbill

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN FISHERMEN VOW TO DEFEND RIGHTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Suao,  eastern  Taiwan,  Oct.  23  (CNA)
(By Debbie Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Indignant at what they
perceive at hegemonic intervention by Japanese patrol boats near the
Tiaoyutai Islands, Taiwan fishermen vowed on Wednesday to protect
their rights in the traditional fishing grounds "by all means
necessary."</P>
      <P>Suao-based fishermen met Wednesday to vent their indignation at
the Japanese Maritime Safety Agency, whose patrol boats, they said,
routinely ram into Taiwan fishing vessels, cut fishing nets and
damage equipment whenever they inadvertently enter the 12-mile zone
around the Tiaoyutai Islands, which have been unilaterally claimed as
Japanese territory by Tokyo.</P>
      <P>The fishermen said that if the government will not take action to
protect their rights, they will use "all means" to fight the
Japanese by themselves, including arming their vessels.</P>
      <P>Tseng Chin-shun, owner of the "Tseng Chin Shun 133" and Liu
Chiu-hai, skipper of the "Hsin Lin Po 26," said bitterly that waters
surrounding the Tiaoyutais have been traditional fishing grounds for
Taiwanese for hundreds years.</P>
      <P>Numerous historical documents prove that the Tiaoyutais were part
of Chinese territory, and gravestones found on the islands bear
Chinese characters indicating that the deceased were residents of
Ilan, eastern Taiwan, they pointed out.</P>
      <P>Deprived of their traditional fishing grounds, the fishermen have
steered clear of the 12-mile exclusive zone around the Tiaoyutais,
called the Senkakus in Japan, despite their insistence that the
Japanese sovereignty claims are unilateral and unjustified.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the fishing vessels sometimes drift into
"prohibited" areas, especially during the days when the "Pakua
Current," a strong and turbulent seasonal tide, is at its apex, as
has been the case in recent days, they lamented.</P>
      <P>It is particularly difficult for them to keep the nets, often
stretching more than one kilometer in length, from drifting into the
12-mile zone when the current is strong, they noted.</P>
      <P>Whenever the Japanese patrol boats spot the nets, they cut them
without hesitation, the fishermen added.</P>
      <P>In a one-week period since Oct. 16, they said, eight Suao-based
fishing boats allegedly operating outside Tiaoyutai waters were badly
damaged after being rammed by Japanese patrol boats. Damages to the
boats and fishing gear exceeded NT$2.5 million (US$83,000), not to
mention the threat to the fishermen's safety and lost income, they
added.</P>
      <P>They categorically demanded that the government dispatch warships
to their aid so long as it continues to claim the Tiaoyutais as
Republic of China territory.</P>
      <P>The uninhabited Tiaoyutai archipelago, claimed by mainland China
as well as Taiwan and Japan, lies in the East China Sea about 200
kilometers northeast of Taiwan and 300 kilometers west of Japan's
Okinawa prefecture.</P>
      <P>The islands, thought to be rich in oil reserves, first came into
spotlight when their control, along with that of the Ryukyu Islands,
was handed over to Japan by Washington, which had administered the
island chains since Japan's defeat in the Second World War.</P>
      <P>The dormant dispute erupted once again following the erection of
a makeshift lighthouse on one of the islands in July last year by a
group of Japanese rightists. The dispute sparked anger in the Chinese
communities in Taiwan, Hong Kong and mainland China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CONTROVERSY IS CHARACTERISTIC OF DPP: HSU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 23 (CNA)
(By Debbie Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman
Hsu Hsin-liang said on Thursday that controversy is normal for the
opposition party and that disagreements will by no means undermine
its chances of winning next month's mayoral and magistrate elections.</P>
      <P>Hsu, who has been under fire in recent days over a proposal to
conduct negotiations on direct trade, postal and transport links with
mainland China, defended the position, saying that it is not uncommon
for members of the 11-year-old party to voice differing opinions over
major issues.</P>
      <P>Hsu made the proposal during a visit in Paris on Oct. 16 in
response to an offer by Beijing to engage Taipei in a bilateral
dialogue aimed at ensuring peace and stability across the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>Controversy is a characteristic, as well as a political asset,
for the DPP, Hsu asserted, adding that DPP is an open and democratic
party whose members are allowed to debate freely before any major
policy position is established.</P>
      <P>"The DPP will never forsake its tradition of respecting the free
expression of differing opinions simply to avoid controversy," he
noted.</P>
      <P>Compared to the rival Kuomintang and the New Party, "wherein
major policies are not produced through democratic processes," the
DPP stands a better chance to win the year-end elections, Hsu said in
denying that internal discord will hurt his party's performance in
the upcoming local elections.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TALKS ON DIRECT CROSS-STRAIT LINKS PREMATURE : MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  23  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Sheu Ke-sheng, vice chairman of the
cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), said Thursday that it
is still too early to discuss direct trade, postal, and
transportation links with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Sheu was responding to local media reports that MAC is now
discussing the timing for opening the "three links."</P>
      <P>Speaking at a public hearing on the issue convened by the
opposition New Party at the legislative yuan, Sheu reaffirmed that
direct cross-strait links are a complicated matter and must be
considered on the premises of national security, dignity, and public
welfare.</P>
      <P>He said that the biggest hurdle for the opening of the direct
links lies in Beijing's continued denial of the fact of separate rule
on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait and its efforts to isolate
Taiwan internationally. In addition, mainland China also refuses to
forswear the use of force against Taiwan, he said.</P>
      <P>New Party Legislator Lee Ching-hua and National Taiwan
University Professor Chang Ling-cheng disagreed with Sheu's remarks,
saying that the government is dragging its feet on opening
transportation links under the pretext of national security.</P>
      <P>Professor Chang added that mainalnd China is the only major
trading partner with whom Taiwan's trade surplus is growing, and
that the continued ban on the three links reflects an "ostrich
mentality."</P>
      <P>Conversely, Chang Liang-jen, deputy secretary general of the
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), backed Sheu's position, saying
that although cross-strait exchanges have been going on for over a
decade, such contacts are still in the early stages and the opening
of the three links remains premature.</P>
      <P>He said that after the ROC and the US severed ties in 1979,
Beijing had delivered a message to Taiwan compatriots indicating
that it would not hesitate to use force to bring about the island's
unification with the mainland. Later, the threats gave way to appeals
for direct links with Taiwan, Chang said.</P>
      <P>But he claimed that such overtures are also rooted in political
strategies and asserted that any dialogue with Beijing should first 
address technical problem arising from cross-strait exchanges.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DREYER'S ICE CREAM FOUND CONTAMINATED</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Five flavors of Dreyer's ice cream have
been found to contain a strain of listeria, the Department of Health
(DOH) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chen Shu-kong, director of the DOH Bureau of Food Sanitation,
said the department has asked Jade Arrow Enterprise, the Taiwan
importer of Dreyer's, to recall and destroy the contaminated
products, which were produced between June 30 and July 31.</P>
      <P>The flavors being recalled are Rocky Road, Butter Pecan LT, FFY
Marble, Strawberry (sugarless) and Vanilla.</P>
      <P>Following reports earlier this month that Hong Kong authorities
had found Dreyer's vanilla ice cream and Cookies 'N Cream ice cream
bars to contain listeria monocytogenes, the DOH tested Dreyer's
products in Taiwan and discovered five of 14 different products
contaminated with the bacteria.</P>
      <P>Listeria monocytogenes can cause fever, nausea, vomiting and
meningitis.</P>
      <P>The DOH has notified Dreyer's Taiwan distributor to recall the
five contaminated products. Taiwan does not import Cookies 'N Cream
ice cream bars.</P>
      <P>The department said it suspects the products became tainted
during production and has asked the Bureau of Commodity Inspection &amp;
Quarantine to increase its inspection of imported ice cream for the
time being.</P>
      <P>Chen said the bacteria is most likely to affect the young, the
old and pregnant women but that the average healthy person is usually
impervious to it.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING MAY SEEK CONCRETE US COMMITMENTS DURING SUMMIT: KMT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 23 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China's President Jiang Zemin may
ask Washington for concrete commitments on opposing Taiwan
independence and ROC participation in the United Nations as well as
on a halt of arms sales to the island, according to Kuomintang (KMT)
sources.</P>
      <P>Jiang is scheduled to visit the United States on Oct. 26 and to
hold a summit meeting with US President Bill Clinton in Washington on
Oct. 29.</P>
      <P>In the latest issue of Mainland Affairs Biweekly, a periodical of
the KMT Mainland Operations Department, published on Wednesday, it
was reported that the Clinton-Jiang meeting will address issues of
"mutual strategic interest" between Washington and Beijing. Hence,
the publication said, the outcome of the summit should be closely
scrutinized, although its substance and conclusions are hard to
predict.</P>
      <P>Prior to Jiang's visit, Beijing launched an all-out propaganda
offensive, saying that Jiang must not return from his US visit
"empty-handed," noted the biweekly.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the propaganda campaign is to influence the
international community into supporting Beijing's calls for the
resumption of negotiations across the Taiwan Strait on its own terms,
the biweekly added.</P>
      <P>As to halting its export of nuclear technology to Iran, the
report continued, Beijing is likely to agree to US requests, but the
concession will by no means come without costs. One condition could
be a request that Washington reciprocate by freezing arms sales to
Taiwan or by making a concrete measure of similar magnitude.</P>
      <P>Beijing is currently planning to convene a national conference on
Taiwan affairs, and what Jiang gains from the Washington-Beijing
summit will most probably emerge during the course of that
conference, the KMT publication stated.</P>
      <P>It added that Beijing's policy toward Taiwan is also likely to be
clearly outlined at that time, which will have a significant bearing
upon the future direction of relations between Taipei and Beijing.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US WILL NOT SILENCE PROTESTS AGAINST JIANG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  22  (CNA)
(By Bill Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The White House said Wednesday that
Washington would not silence protests during mainland Chinese
President Jiang Zemin's visit here next week, noting that it
considers it a positive thing for "leaders of a totalitarian system"
to see a healthy debate on controversial issues.</P>
      <P>"It's welcome to democracy," White House Press Secretary Mike
McCurry told a regular press briefing when asked to comment on
remarks by a mainland Chinese embassy official earlier in the day
urging the US government to silence demonstrators. "That's not going
to happen," McCurry added.</P>
      <P>McCurry said that Washington has tried to help the Beijing
leadership understand the vibrant political culture that the American
people have, the way in which Americans freely express their ideas,
and the importance they, as a free people, attach to the right of
dissent, the right of expression, and the freedom to openly express
one's views.</P>
      <P>The press secretary said that Washington has made it clear to
Beijing that "they can anticipate seeing that reflected in the very
healthy debate about China that will occur during the state visit."</P>
      <P>"They will be able to read in our newspapers, see in our streets,
encounter anecdotally the way in which Americans deal with
controversial issues," he said.</P>
      <P>"And we think that will be a positive and good thing for leaders
of a totalitarian system to see that healthy debate should not be
feared," he went on.</P>
      <P>In fact, he said, Washington believes Beijing should embrace such
debates because mainland China's move toward a market economy
requires the political freedoms that are associated with a democratic
system.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Jeffrey Bader, director of Asian Affairs at the
National Security Council, said at a Foreign Press Center briefing
here that a state visit involves first-class treatment of the
visitor, and there are certain perquisites and certain protocol
arrangements associated with it.</P>
      <P>At the same time, Bader pointed out, there are Americans who have
strong feelings about one or another aspect of Beijing's policy --
whether in the area of human rights or Tibet or something else -- and
that the US Bill of Rights guarantees the right to demonstrate.</P>
      <P>"We are not going to abrogate the US Constitution in order to
provide the right atmosphere for this visit," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HK CHOOSES NOT TO SCREEN FILMS ON TIBET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Oct.  22  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Hong Kong's private film distributors,
under Beijing's political authority, have chosen not to screen
Hollywood's latest films depicting Tibet's struggle against Communist
Chinese domination, a Canadian newspaper said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Globe and Mail noted that the distributors buckled on "Seven
Years in Tibet" and "Kundun" without the urging of Beijing, although
Hong Kong is supposed to enjoy autonomy in such decisions about film
distribution, not to mention freedom of speech.</P>
      <P>"Seven Years in Tibet," starring Brad Pitt, is a rendition of an
Austrian mountain climber's encounter with Buddhism and the young
Dalai Lama in the lead-up to China's invasion of the Himalayan
territory, according to the Mail. Director Martin Scorsese's "Kundun
chronicles Tibet's resistance against Beijing in the 1950s, which was
assisted by the US Central Intelligence Agency.</P>
      <P>In an editorial, the Mail said there is no bigger thorn in
mainland China's side than Tibet. The popularity in Hollywood and
worldwide of the remote autonomous region, as well as its religiously
motivated resistance to political domination and desire for
self-determination, is an irritant to atheist and chauvinist Beijing.</P>
      <P>Beyond Beijing, however, Tibetan independence is a taboo subject
for many Chinese of Han origin, said the editorial titled, "Hong
Kong's Tibet threat."</P>
      <P>And threats to the cultural and territorial integrity of the
Chinese motherland, whether from Tibet, Taiwan, Muslim-dominated
areas or the Southeast Asian Spratly Islands, are fiercely resisted
by Chinese nationalists of all kinds, it said. "Most of all by the
dictatorship in Beijing," it added.</P>
      <P>"It's this chauvinist Han nationalism that makes China the bad
guy in the eyes of Tibetans and their sympathizers," it said, noting
there is no doubt that in "Seven Years in Tibet," the Chinese are the
bad guys, portrayed as conniving, strident and ruthless.</P>
      <P>That's all the more reason for Hong Kong to have tolerated the
films -- to show that the experimental, free Chinese city-state can
take the criticism and refute it in open debate, the Mail said. "But
no such luck," it opined.</P>
      <P>It pointed to "a certain irony" in one special Chinese region,
Hong Kong, failing to identify the experience of another, Tibet. But
then again, it concluded, magnanimity and brotherly love have rarely
been characteristics of those who feel pressure bearing down upon
them from above.</P>

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 10 percent of Year 7 students
(normally aged 11 or 12) in Queensland, Australia drank alcohol
regularly last year, according to a new survey by the Department of
Education and the University of Queensland.</P>
      <P>Alcohol consumption among Year 12 students has also increased
dramatically over the past three years, according to the survey
conducted late last year of 3,600 children from the Queensland
State's private schools, the mass circulation newspaper The Sydney
Morning Herald reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>The survey also shows 20 percent of Year 12 students were regular
marijuana users, while more than half had tried the drug.</P>
      <P>One in three Year 12 students were regular cigarette smokers.
About 15 percent of boys and 10 percent of girls in the final year of
primary school reported they drank alcohol in the week before being
survey.</P>
      <P>The survey found 10 percent of Year 7 children had sniffed
intoxicants, such as glue.</P>
      <P>The leader of the survey, Associate Professor John Lowe, said the
consumption of alcohol, cigarettes or illicit drugs within the week
before completing the survey indicates regular usage.</P>
      <P>The survey found 58 percent of males and 53 percent of females in
Year 12 drank alcohol during the previous week -- an 8 percent rise
on a similarly survey conducted in 1993.</P>
      <P>The National Drug and Alcohol Research Center said the proportion
of younger alcohol users is a concern.</P>
      <P>"The reality is 60 percent of drug-related deaths in young people
are because of alcohol," according to the center spokesman Paul
Dillon.</P>

      <P>The European Commission is preparing to

continue, despite a controversial ban on the use of cattle
derivatives, according to a just released report by the World Trade

    <HEADLINE>OFFICIAL ASSERTS NO CHANGE IN US POLICY TOWARD TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  22  (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States does not intend to
seek improved relations with mainland China at the expense of Taiwan,
a senior Clinton administration official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Briefing the press on the forthcoming summit between US President
Bill Clinton and his Communist Chinese counterpart Jiang Zemin, the
director for Asian affairs at the US National Security Council,
Jeffrey Bader, said that US policy on Taiwan is guided by the Taiwan
Relations Act of 1979, which is US law. However, he added that the
1982 joint communique between Washington and Beijing also applies in
terms of US arms supplies to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Relations Act requires the United States to provide
sufficient weapons of defensive nature to Taiwan for its own
security, while the 1982 communique declared that the United States
would gradually reduce its arms sales to Taiwan both qualitatively
and quantitatively, as the tension between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait decreased.</P>
      <P>"We have not changed, nor are we changing, our policy on arms
sales to Taiwan," he said.</P>
      <P>According to Bader, the United States does not anticipate
announcing new policies with regard to Taiwan at the Clinton-Jiang
summit.</P>
      <P>Bader also gave assurances that the United States will not change
its policy of allowing Taiwan leaders to enter the United States for
private visits or transit stops. Nor will Clinton sign a fourth joint
communique on the issue of Taiwan with Jiang at their Oct. 29 summit
in Washington.</P>
      <P>"We have a 'one China' policy, and we encourage resumption of
cross-strait exchanges in a constructive way between the PRC and
Taiwan," he said, adding that the Clinton administration has made it
very clear that these basic elements of US policy "are not going to
be changed in the lead up to or during or as a consequence of his
(Jiang's) visit."</P>
      <P>Asked if Clinton and Jiang may address the Taiwan issue in a
joint statement at the end of their summit, Bader said he does not
know at this point what form of public announcements may result from
the summit, because those matters are still being discussed between
the two sides.</P>
      <P>"But whatever the form is, there will not be a fourth
communique," he said.</P>
      <P>He stressed that whatever is said about Taiwan in public
statements at the end of the summit will be consistent with the
principles governing the long-standing US policy toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Asked how the United States would react to a proposal from
Beijing to condition its nuclear nonproliferation on an end to US
arms sales to Taiwan, Bader pointed out that under the Taiwan
Relations Act, the United States is committed to providing sufficient
arms to Taiwan for its defense.</P>
      <P>"This is the standard we use for deciding what arms to sell to
Taiwan. We do not accept linkage to other extraneous subjects," he
said.</P>

      <P>US Senator Joseph Lieberman (D-Conn.)
has introduced a bill in the Senate that he says would encourage the
integration of mainland China into the world community while
protecting US economic and political interests and preserving US
values.</P>
      <P>The bill, cosponsored by three other senators, is titled "The
United States-China Relations Act of 1997." It would grant mainland
China permanent most-favored-nation trade status upon its accession
to the World Trade Organization.</P>
      <P>One provision would require the US president to submit an annual
study to the Congress, analyzing the impact of existing bilateral

participation in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development and G-Seven meetings.</P>
      <P>The president would also be required to establish a bilateral

    <HEADLINE>FORMER AUSSIE PM CONDEMNS JOHN HOWARD FOR LACK OF LEADERSHIP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct.  23 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>One of Australia's former Liberal Party
prime ministers has condemned the current Liberal Prime Minister John
Howard for his policy to slash immigration and his failure to stem
racism in public discourse and convince people that Australia's
future is in Asia.</P>
      <P>Malcolm Fraser, four-time prime minister between 1975 and 1983
and a long-serving Liberal leader, said Howard and other Australian
leaders have no long-term means to keep the country strong and safe.</P>
      <P>Speaking on television in Canberra Wednesday, Fraser blasted
Howard's refusal to condemn Queensland Independent Member of
Parliament Pauline Hanson and his view that free speech allows racist
comments.</P>
      <P>"This used to be a country in which those who had racist views
would be regarded as outcasts. We need to re-emphasize that those who
express racist views ... are unacceptable in civilized society," he
said.</P>
      <P>Fraser stressed his belief that Australia's only future is with
Asia.</P>
      <P>"There is no other future for us. Those who want to take us back
to the past should be cast aside," he said, adding, "We need a
full-blooded commitment to that future from all Australians and
Australian institutions but especially from those who lead or aspire
to lead us into the next century."</P>
      <P>Addressing the issue of immigration, he said: "Large scale
immigration is always a sensitive issue but (before) there was
understanding between Australia's leaders that this was vital for the
security of our children and therefore racial issues were off-limits
in the political arena. We need seriously to ask ourselves why people
throughout Asia do not yet believe that rejection of Pauline Hanson
and what she stands for is adequate."</P>
      <P>Hanson last year demanded that the government stop Asian
immigration and she formed the One Nation Party to advocate her "four
ones" -- one nation, one flag, one race and one language.</P>
      <P>Fraser said if Australia has only 20 million to 25 million people
by the year 2050, Asia would see the country as "insular and
selfish," but that with a population of 40-50 million it would have a
reasonable voice.</P>
      <P>"The idea of growing Australia to secure the future of Australian
children has blown away in the dust," he said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan fishermen in Suao, Ilan are
accusing Japan of taking strong-arm actions against Taiwan fishing
boats operating on the seas near the Diaoyutai islands, and saying
that they would form a self-defense force to protect their fishing
fights in the area.</P>
      <P>An official of the Suao Fishermen's Association said Thursday
that at least three Taiwan fishing boats have been struck and damaged
by Japanese patrol boats recently. The fishing nets and other fishing
tools of at least five other Taiwan boats have also been cut or
dragged away by the Japanese purposely.</P>
      <P>The fishermen in the Suao area have shown strong anger, saying
they would set up a self-defense force to protect themselves, he

      <P>Japan, Taiwan, and mainland China have simultaneously claimed
sovereignty over the tiny uninhabitable islands in the East China
Sea.</P>
      <P>An official of the Council of Agriculture Thursday asked Taiwan

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATORS, SCHOLARS WORRIED ABOUT CLINTON-JIANG TALKS ABOUT TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  23  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Several legislators Thursday expressed
their worry that the up-coming talks between President Bill Clinton
and mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin in Washington may hurt
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Jiang is scheduled to leave for the United States this weekend
for a week-long official visit.</P>
      <P>The legislators expressed their worry at the "Forum on National
Affairs" of the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Tsai Ming-hsien (DPP-Taichung City) urged the U.S. government not
to hurt Taiwan for the sake of economic benefits. He also urged
Taiwan's diplomats to pay special attention to the talks between
Clinton and Jiang in Washington.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan people are unwilling to accept the Chinese Communist
regime as their ruler. The U.S. government should respect the wish
of Taiwan people and help Taiwan join the United Nations," he said.</P>
      <P>Pan Wei-kang (KMT-Taipei City) said that, facing the challenge
of "Clinton-Jiang talks," the government should really do something
about it. "Making a pep talk to the people is not enough."</P>
      <P>Cheng Pao-ching (DPP-Taoyuan County) said Jiang's talks with
Clinton in Washington could upgrade U.S. engagement with mainland
China from "strategic dialogue" to "strategic partnership." If this
happens, the military cooperation between Washington and Beijing
will be strengthened, and Taiwan's security may be endangered, he
said.</P>
      <P>Chu Huei-liang (NP-Taipei City) said that, facing the challenge
of "Clinton-Jiang talks," the ruling and opposition parties should
hold consultations so as to reach a consensus on how to handle the
relations with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, at a public hearing sponsored Thursday by NP Legislator
Chen I-hsin, several scholars expressed their worry about the
possible impact of "Clinton-Jiang talks" on U.S. arms sales to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>T. L. Chiu, a researcher at the Academia Sinica, pointed out
that Beijing is sending out many messages to convince the United
States that the situation in the Taiwan Strait is peaceful, and
therefore the United States need not sell advanced weapons to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that Washington and Beijing have made it clear
that they are not going to sign a fourth communique during Jiang's
visit to Washington, but Taiwan could still be hurt if a joint
statement were issued at the end of Jiang's visit to Washington.</P>
      <P>Chiu said Taiwan could be hurt badly, if in the joint statement
the United States promised not to support Taiwan's bid to join world
organizations, expressed the hope for peaceful unification of the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait, or said anything that could reduce
U.S. arms sales to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Some other scholars also expressed their worry that the
"Clinton-Jiang talks" might produce some effects on U.S. arms sales
for the defense of Taiwan. (by Ed Hsieh)</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA SAID TO BE A HAVEN FROM ASIAN ECONOMIC TURMOIL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct.  23  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite a plunge in the Australian
currency Wednesday, Australian Treasurer Peter Costello, has declared
that his country would be a haven from the financial crisis that has
hit many Southeast Asian countries.</P>
      <P>The Australian dollar hit a 28-month low against the US dollar
Wednesday, closing at 71.25 US cents.</P>
      <P>But Australia's All Ordinaries Index closed 32.2 points higher at
2682.9 the same day.</P>
      <P>There was also good news on the inflation front. As measured by
the Consumer Price Index, inflation here fell 0.4 percent in the
September quarter and by 0.3 percent over the same period last year.</P>
      <P>Costello said the inflation results confirm that Australia's
economic fundamentals are "exceptionally strong" and "among the best"
in the world.</P>
      <P>"As people from outside look at the Australian economy, they see
a growth economy with low inflation, a strong fiscal position, a good
independent monetary policy and a sound financial system," he said.</P>
      <P>"And these are the things on which there is a premium in world
economies," he said.</P>
      <P>He noted Australia's exports to the four financially troubled
countries -- Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines and Malaysia --
only account for 11 percent of its total exports to Asia.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong and mainland China all
combined account for about 46 percent of Australia's overall exports.</P>
      <P>Costello said the problems in Southeast Asia have also caused a
ripple effect in the major economies of the region.</P>
      <P>With the plunge of shares on the Hong Kong stock market, analysts
said investors are scrambling to get out of Asia and that safe havens
like Australia are being hit as well.</P>
      <P>Thailand's currency hit a new low as party leaders haggled over
forming a new government.</P>
      <P>The leadership of Japanese Prime Minister Hashimoto was
drastically weakened as markets gave the thumbs-down to his latest
economic revival plan.</P>
      <P>With all these developments, Costello put on a brave face
and declared that the upheaval would make Australia a "premium"
economy for international investors.</P>
      <P>But Goldman Sachs, the Wall Street investment bank, said the
Asian crisis is "likely to be a major economic shock for both
Australia and New Zealand" in the coming year.</P>
      <P>The Australian Bureau of Agriculture Resources and Economics and
the National Farmers Federation warned Wednesday that Australia's
beef and wheat exports to Asia are being threatened by the Asian
currency crises.</P>
      <P>The depreciation of the Australian currency, however, may cause
problems for the country's coal and iron ore exports to major markets
such as Japan, Korea and Taiwan because importers are expected to
demand lower prices.</P>
      <P>Australia's educational exports are also bracing for hard times
as more and more parents in financially troubled Asian countries are
expected to tighten their belts and avoid sending their children
abroad as the result of the financial crisis at home.</P>
      <P>Australia's tourism industry is facing similar problems due to
the expected decline in the number of Asian tourists from Taiwan,
Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines to Australia in coming months.</P>
      <P>As a result of a cut in immigration intake, Australia is expected
to experience a slump in its property industry, which has been in the
doldrums since the early 1990s.</P>
      <P>Analysts said whether Australia would become a real haven for
many investors remains to be seen.</P>

    <HEADLINE>YANG YING-FENG: A LIFE OF ARTISTIC CREATION (PART I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.  23  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>He led a life of imagination and
inspiration, blending traditional Chinese aesthetics and Buddhist
imagery with avant-garde artistic concepts. When he died, he left
behind a creative legacy of enduring beauty and a touch of the
divine.</P>
      <P>Yang Ying-feng, a Taiwan-born sculptor who achieved international
fame with his Oriental-flavor modernistic sculptures, died of a lung
ailment on Oct. 21 at a Buddhist monastery in the northern Taiwan
city of Hsinchu. He was 71.</P>
      <P>A versatile and prolific artist, Yang left behind a large
collection of artworks, ranging from blockprints, bronze and stone
sculptures to landscapes.</P>
      <P>A gifted man with a burning thirst for knowledge, Yang never
hesitated to attempt new things. His artistic style evolved with age,
shifting from realism to the abstract.</P>
      <P>In the latter stages of his career, Yang dedicated himself to
stainless steel sculpture. He injected life and vigor into dull,
staid stainless steel plates, a product of modern technology. The
dazzling array of stainless steel sculptures Yang created over the
past 20-odd years clearly reflects his views of the universe and his
pursuit of conformity between humanity and providence.</P>
      <P>The master sculptor started his career by creating blockprints
featuring Taiwan's rural landscape and life. Those works, dating
mostly from 1951 to the early 1960s, reflected his deep feelings for
his native land. In addition to projecting realistic images, some of
his early creations were also infused with abstract concepts.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Li-fa, an art historian, described Yang's blockprints as
"incorporating a deep indigenous consciousness with avant-garde
artistic ideas."</P>
      <P>Yang began to experiment with sculptures depicting the human body
and religious themes in 1954. His feminine figures reflected Oriental
concepts of beauty and taste. During this period, Yang also took
inspiration from the Buddhist deities carved in grottoes at Yungang
on the Chinese mainland to create a unique series of sculptures in
religious motif.</P>
      <P>His breakthrough came in 1963 when he traveled to Italy to pursue
higher learning. The themes and subjects of subsequent works became
deliberately more abstract, linear and stylized.</P>
      <P>Yang found residence in the scenic eastern Taiwan city of Hualien
after his return from Italy in the late 1960s. His creative endeavors
also entered a new stage. He began to use axes to chop wood and
stones into grand and impressive shapes, which represented not only
beauty and grandeur but also his philosophical outlook.</P>
      <P>Yang became internationally renowned in 1970 when he showed to
the world his massive stainless steel sculpture entitled "Blessing of
the Phoenix." The work, featuring a traditional Chinese theme with
modernistic sculpting techniques and concepts, was a major attraction
at the 1970 Osaka Expo. It received rave reviews from art critics
around the world.</P>
      <P>From then on, Yang focused his energies on sculptures using the
stainless steel medium. Through his works, Yang conveyed his concepts
of the universe, nature, humanity and beauty, as well as his
understanding of Buddhist scripture and doctrines.

      <P>Huang Tsai-lung, curator of the Kaohsiung Museum of Fine Arts,
said Yang's stainless steel sculptures, which are designed to form an
integral part of their surroundings rather than being objects to be
viewed solely on their own, demonstrate unique lineal beauty and are
imbued with deep sensitivity of feeling, taste and philosophical
thought. "Yang's works are full of cultural diversity and symbolic
meaning. In addition to showing the qualities of maturity and
refinement, his works provide a rich source of inspiration," Huang
noted.</P>
      <P>Yang was the first Taiwan artist to explore the art of stainless
steel sculpture and, many of his works have been installed outdoors
at Taiwan's major tourist resorts and in front of high-rise
commercial buildings. One of his stainless steel works -- "East-West
Gate," created in 1973, is on permanent display on New York's
bustling Wall Street. "Yang's artistic spirit, together with his
works, will permanently bless all those public places," Huang said.</P>
      <P>During his lifetime, Yang's works were exhibited in nearly every
major art capital of the world and a definitive retrospective of his
work, covering the master sculptor's major creations throughout his
60-year career, has been going on at Japan's Hakone Open-Air Arts
Museum since Aug. 1.</P>
      <P>Due to his failing health, Yang was unable to attend the opening
of the Hakone exhibition, which will last until Oct. 26, but shortly
before the opening, Yang recounted to the local press some of the
formative events that led him into the arts world.</P>
      <P>Recalling that his mother, Buddhism and traditional Oriental
aesthetics have extensively influenced his creative work, he said the
image of his mother was his first-hand experience of beauty.</P>
      <P>Born in Ilan, a scenic, rainy city on Taiwan's northeastern coast
in 1926, Yang was raised by his maternal grandparents after his
parents traveled to the Chinese mainland to launch a business career
while he was still a child.</P>
      <P>"I'll always remember the words my mother said to me on the eve
of her departure for the mainland: `Do you see the moon? The place
Mom wants to go can also see this same moon. I'll be watching over
you just like the moon does,'" Yang recalled.</P>
      <P>He said he used to believe that the moon acted as a mirror and
could reflect his image to his mother. "I felt a deep sense of
happiness every time I saw moonlight, and this feeling has been a
major source of inspiration for my creations."</P>
      <P>Yang was reunited with his parents in mainland China after he
finished his elementary education in Taiwan and he was enrolled in a
Beijing high school. On one occasion, he toured the city of Datong,
in northwestern Shanxi province, a visit which turned out to be a
turning point in his life.</P>
      <P>Yang said he was almost overwhelmed upon seeing a cluster of
carved Buddhist figures in the grottoes of Yungang on the outskirts
of Datong. "I stood in awe when I saw these imposing Buddhist images.
They were depicted in simple lines, but managed nevertheless to
inspire a vigorous, powerful sense of divinity and grandeur in my
mind."</P>
      <P>So moved was he by the magnificent artworks that Yang said the
desire to pursue a career in the arts began to ferment in his mind.</P>
      <P>After graduating from the school in Beijing, Yang went to Japan
in 1943 to receive his tertiary education. He was admitted to the
architecture department of the Tokyo Fine Arts College and attended
classes given by noted Japanese architect Isoya Yoshida, who had a
special affinity for ancient Chinese (Tang Dynasty, A.D. 618-907)
architecture. Yang later described the Northern Wei Dynasty (A.D.
220-589) stone-carving art and the Tang Dynasty architecture as the
two most distinct expressions of traditional Chinese aesthetics.</P>
      <P>Yang returned to Taiwan after the Chinese communists took control
of the mainland in 1949, working first as an art editor for the
"Harvest" agricultural magazine, which allowed him to gain first-hand
information and a well-developed sense of Taiwan's farming community
and inspired him to create woodblocks featuring scenes of everyday
rural life.</P>
      <P>Yang had been troubled by skin and lung ailments since the
beginning of this year. He spent most of his last days of life at the
Fayuan Buddhist Temple, where one of his daughters is a practicing
Buddhist nun and where his ashes will be interred following a funeral
service on November 2.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FRENCH CEMETERY IN KEELUNG OPENS TO PUBLIC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  23  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A 19th century French cemetery in the
northern Taiwan port city of Keelung was formally opened to the
public on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Keelung Mayor Lin Shui-mu and R.T. Yang, director of the European
Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA), jointly
presided over a ceremony marking the opening of the 112-year-old
graveyard.</P>
      <P>Amid the boisterous sound of gongs and drums and following a
spirited lion dance performance, Yang presented the key to the
cemetery to Lin, symbolizing the transfer of its administration to
the Keelung City Government.</P>
      <P>The French Institute in Taiwan, which represents French interests
on the island in the absence of formal diplomatic ties, turned the
cemetery's administration over to the MOFA earlier this week.</P>
      <P>The graveyard, which covers roughly one square kilometer, was
established in 1885 by the French government to inter the remains of
some 700 French troops who were killed in Taiwan in the 1884 war
between France and Ching Dynasty China.</P>
      <P>In that year, the Manchu government went to war with France over
French actions in Annam (present-day Vietnam), then a Chinese
protectorate.</P>
      <P>During the war, a French fleet attacked Taiwan and attempted to
land on the island, losing many men in a fierce battle. The French
war-dead were laid to rest in the Keelung cemetery the following
year. A monument was also erected in the cemetery in honor of the
dead, but today, few of the names of those buried in the graveyard
are still legible. The remains of another two French officers who
also died in the 1884 war and were originally buried in Penghu, were
reburied in the Keelung cemetery in 1954.</P>
      <P>Lin said the French Institute in Taiwan had until recently been
responsible for the upkeep of the cemetery, adding that the city
government will gradually refurbish the area, plant more flowers and
trees and build additional walking paths, in order to make the site
more pleasant for local residents.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ASIAN STATES SHOULD WORK TOGETHER TO MEET FINANCIAL CRISIS: SCHOLAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  23  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Financial authorities of the four "Asian
tiger" economies and mainland China should act in concert to defend
their currencies rather than resign them to irrational sliding, a
renowned economic scholar said here Thursday.</P>
      <P>The call by Wu Rong-i, president of the Taiwan Institute of
Economic Research, a private think tank, came in the wake of the Hong
Kong stock market plunging sharply Thursday for the second day in a
row.</P>
      <P>Noting that Hong Kong, like Taiwan, has solid economic
fundamentals and huge foreign exchange reserves but still fell victim
to a strong expectation that its currency would drop, Wu called the
depreciations unreasonable and blamed speculators for these and the
falls on the Hong Kong and Taiwan stock markets.</P>
      <P>Speculators, Wu said, are using the financial crisis plaguing
Southeast Asian countries to fan public anticipation that the Hong
Kong dollar will be the next domino falling in a wave of devaluation
that has swept Southeast Asia, even though the Hong Kong economic
situation does not justify the expectation.</P>
      <P>To shield the currencies of regional states from foreign
speculators' irrational attacks, Wu said, the region's states,
especially the four so-called Asian Tigers -- Hong Kong, Taiwan,
South Korea and Singapore -- should join hands along with mainland
China to take on the speculators.</P>
      <P>Warning a devaluation of the Hong Kong dollar would trigger a
round of devaluation in neighboring states -- which would fear their
exports would not be competitive otherwise -- and wreak havoc with
the regional economy, Wu proposed that APEC (the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation forum) install a mechanism through which
countries can jointly intervene in case of such a financial crisis.</P>
      <P>He also called on the Taipei-based Central Bank of China (CBC) to
keep the New Taiwan dollar stronger than NT$30 to 1 US dollar.</P>
      <P>Given that the greenback has risen against the world's major
currencies about 2 percent thus far this year, Wu said he believes a
commensurate devaluation of the NT dollar would be acceptable, which
would place the Taiwan currency better than NT$30 to one US dollar.
Any devaluation beyond that range should be met with strong
government intervention, he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has seen its currency shed 10.2 percent of its value
against the US dollar since the beginning of this year, including a 7
percent plunge last week after the CBC, which had thrown more than
US$5 billion into propping up the NT dollar, abandoned its
intervention attempts on Oct. 17.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  23  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The recent surge of interest rates and
plunge of stock market in Hong Kong is unlikely to hurt the 
financial market of Taiwan, Han Chi, director general of the Banking
Department of the Central Bank of China, said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong government Thursday pushed overnight interests as
high as 300 percent. The mortgage rates went up 0.75 percent to 9.5
percent as a result. Hong Kong's main stock index was down by 14
percent Thursday, the biggest loss since August. The stock market
has lost 40 percent of its value since then.</P>
      <P>Han said he believed Taiwan's financial market is immune to the
drastic changes in Hong Kong. "Because our financial market is very
healthy, and the financial systems of Hong Kong and Taiwan are
different," he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Vice Finance Minister Wu Chia-sheng said Thursday
that the impact of financial crisis in Southeast Asia on Taiwan's
stock market can be reduced to a minimum, because the fundamentals
of Taiwan's economy are sound.</P>
      <P>Wu pointed out that Taiwan's economic growth is expected to reach
6.6 percent this year. It has trade surplus and a big amount of
foreign exchange reserves. The growth rate of private investment in
Taiwan is highest in five years, and foreign capital accounts for
about four percent of Taiwan's stock market only.</P>
      <P>In addition, he said, his ministry is able to keep the Taiwan
stock market healthy. (by Ed Hsieh)</P>

      <P>The presidents of 11 of Taiwan's national
universities called on Thursday for the government to spend more on
further education, saying that budgets for national universities have
posted negative growth for the past six years, if inflation rates are
taken into account.</P>
      <P>Chen Wei-chau, President of National Taiwan University, said in
the unprecedented joint press conference that the government's budget
for national universities increased 36 percent in fiscal 1998 from
fiscal 1992, while the number of students grew by 30 percent and
spending on each undergraduate rose 4 percent. However, he pointed
out that the consumer price index rose 21.47 percent during the
six-year period, making the spending on each student actually show a
decline of NT$32,000.</P>
      <P>Deducting the newly-established retirement fund, pay raises for
faculties and insurance premiums from the budget, the actual spending
on each student will drop NT$48,000 in fiscal 1998 compared with
fiscal 1992, Chen said.</P>
      <P>"Government spending on each undergraduate in Taiwan is much less
than in neighboring countries," he said, citing as examples ROC
government spending for each student at about NT$200,000 in fiscal
1998, compared with Hong Kong's Chinese University, at NT$520,000 in
1995, Hong Kong University's NT$920,000 in 1996, Osaka University's

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN EXPORTS MAY BE HIT BY VOLATILE HK DOLLAR: MOF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  24  (CNA)
(By Debbie Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's export business will face a
serious challenge if the Hong Kong dollar continues to fall,
officials from the Ministry of Finance (MOF) said Friday.</P>
      <P>A depreciated Hong Kong currency will weaken Taiwan's
competitiveness on the international markets as the former British
colony is Taiwan's major competitor. The fall will also cut back
Taiwan's exports to Hong Kong, Taiwan's second largest export outlet,
consequently diminishing the island's trade surplus, an MOF spokesman
said.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong and the United States have traditionally alternated as
Taiwan's largest export markets. In the first three quarters of this
year, 23 percent of Taiwan's exports were directed toward Hong Kong,
as compared with 24 percent to the American market, according to Hsu
Kuo-chung, director of the MOF's Statistics Department.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong is also Taiwan's largest source of trade surplus, Hsu
noted. Taiwan posted a trade surplus of US$25.1 billion with Hong
Kong in 1996, as compared with the island's overall positive trade
balance of US$13.5 billion in the same year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan would have suffered a trade deficit last year, mainly
because of a huge deficit with Japan, had the island not enjoyed a
mammoth surplus with Hong Kong, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>If the Hong Kong currency continues to depreciate, the
competitive edge of Taiwan's exports will be reduced. Since about
half of Taiwan's exports to Hong Kong are destined for mainland
China, a similar fall of the mainland renminbi could spur even
greater losses to Taiwan exporters, he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hsu said the currency crises in Southeast Asian
countries will have little adverse impact on Taiwan's exports as
those economies generally have much weaker foundations than does
Taiwan's, and their export products and major export outlets are
different from those of Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC VOWS TO DEFEND FISHING RIGHTS AROUND TIAOYUTAIS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  24 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) on
Friday expressed concern over Japan's alleged high-handed actions
against Taiwan fishing boats operating in waters near the Tiaoyutai
islands, which are claimed by Taiwan, mainland China and Japan.</P>
      <P>Reiterating the Republic of China's sovereignty over the
uninhabited Tiaoyutais, the ministry said the ROC government must
receive guarantees on the rights of Taiwan fishermen to operate in
traditional fishing grounds near the disputed island group before it
will sign a new fishery accord with Japan.</P>
      <P>"We have asked the Council of Agriculture to investigate reports
that eight Suao-based Taiwan fishing vessels have recently been
rammed by Japanese patrol boats when they were operating in waters
near the Tiaoyutais," said Chang Chin-chu, director of the MOFA's
East Asian and Pacific Affairs Department.</P>
      <P>Chang said the MOFA has also ordered the ROC's representative
offices in Tokyo and Okinawa to look into the incidents and convey
the ROC's grave concern to the Japanese government.</P>
      <P>Negotiators from Taiwan and Japan met twice last year to discuss
the ROC's traditional fishing rights in waters surrounding the
Tiaoyutais, but failed to reach an agreement.</P>
      <P>As Japan intends to finalize fishing rights negotiations with
mainland China and South Korea before striking a deal with Taiwan on
similar issues, a planned third round of Taipei-Tokyo fishery talks
has been put on hold.</P>
      <P>"We'll push Japan to conduct a third-round meeting with our
country as soon as possible to resolve the longstanding disputes over
Tiaoyutai fishing rights," Chang said.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that the MOFA has also asked the Taipei office
of the Japanese Interchange Association, which handles exchanges with
Taiwan in the absence of formal diplomatic ties, to probe the latest
dispute.</P>
      <P>Chang said the government has consistently upheld three
principles in dealing with fishing disputes with Japan: insisting on
ROC sovereignty claims over the Tiaoyutais, handling the issue in a
peaceful and rational manner, and defending local fishermen's
legitimate rights and interests.</P>
      <P>The Suao Fishermen's Association complained on Thursday that at
least three local fishing boats have been struck and damaged by
Japanese patrol boats over the past week, and fishing gear belonging
to five other local fishing vessels has also been destroyed or
confiscated by the Japanese.</P>
      <P>The fishermen in the Suao area claimed that the actions by the
Japanese coast guard have cost them more than NT$2.5 million
(US$83,000) in damages to their boats and equipment. They vowed to
form a self-defense force to protect themselves if the government
fails to take effective measures to safeguard their rights and
interests.</P>
      <P>The fishermen said the Japanese have consistently mercilessly
rammed into Taiwan fishing boats, cut their fishing nets and damaged
their other equipment whenever the ships inadvertently enter the
12-mile zone around the Tiaoyutais, which Japan has unilaterally
claimed as its territory.</P>
      <P>The Tiaoyutai archipelago lies in the East China Sea about 200
kilometers northeast of Taiwan and 300 kms west of Japan's Okinawa
prefecture.</P>
      <P>The uninhabitable islets first came into limelight in 1972 when
their control, along with that of the Ryukyu Islands, was handed over
to Japan by the United States, which had administered the island
group since Japan's defeat in World War II.</P>
      <P>The sovereignty dispute erupted once again in July 1996 when a
Japanese ultrarightist group erected a makeshift lighthouse on one of
the Tiaoyutai islets. The move angered people in Taiwan, mainland
China and Hong Kong.</P>

      <P>A task force under the Ministry of Economic
Affairs (MOEA) that screens proposed Taiwan investments in mainland
China on Friday approved the first project to build a golf course
there.</P>
      <P>MOEA Vice Minister Yin Chi-ming said a Taiwan businessman

BEIJING THREATS HINDER CROSS-STRAIT TIES</P>
      <P>Taipei, Oct. 24 (CNA) Lin Chung-ping, vice chairman of the
Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), said Thursday that
mainland China's unwillingness to renounce the use of force against
Taiwan has become a major hurdle to improved cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Lin made the remarks at the Legislative Yuan in a public hearing
on the impact of the upcoming meeting between US President Bill
Clinton and mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin upon cross-strait
relations.</P>
      <P>Lin stressed that the welfare of 21 million people on Taiwan must
not be compromised by improved Washington-Beijing ties.</P>
      <P>Lin declared that the ROC is happy to see the US engagement
with mainland China, saying that communication helps to promote
understanding and defuse confrontation.</P>
      <P>He said that the interaction between Washington and Beijing will
also contribute to the overall stability of Asia and Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Washington has promised to inform Taipei of anything arising from
the Clinton-Jiang meeting which relates to Taiwan, Lin said, adding
however that the United States has repeatedly stated it has no
intention of acting as a mediator between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Lin said, Washington is hoping that cross-strait
dialogue can be resumed soon, although it will not interfere with the
timing, form or content of the talks.</P>
      <P>Lin said that the ROC hopes the Beijing leadership has
consolidated its power base after the Communist Party congress, and
that it can accept the fact of separate rule on the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Lin said that if both Taipei and Beijing could put aside their
differences over the issue of sovereignty, and resume talks without
prior conditions, then such a pragmatic approach would contribute to
the stability of the Taiwan Strait, and also help to promote
cross-strait economic development.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC FOREX RESERVES DROP TO NEW LOW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  24  (CNA)
(By Debbie Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As of the end of September, Taiwan's
foreign exchange reserves dropped to US$85.75 billion, their lowest
level in 15 months, the Central Bank of China (CBC) reported Friday.</P>
      <P>CBC officials said the September figure represents a US$2.04
billion decrease from the previous month, and attributed the drop to
the CBC's interference in the foreign exchange market in the wake of
the currency crises in Southeast Asian nations.</P>
      <P>The falling amount also ousted Taiwan from the top-three list of
the world's largest forex reserves holders.</P>
      <P>In a bid to stabilize Taipei's foreign exchange market and to
deflect the impact of the Southeast Asian currency crises, the CBC
has sold some US$5 billion since July, resulting in a steady drop in
the island's forex reserves, down from June's US$90.02 billion to
US$88.77 billion in July, and from August's US$87.79 billion to
US$85.75 billion in September.</P>
      <P>The CBC also stepped into the foreign exchange market in March
1996, when mainland China lobbed missiles near Taiwan in an attempt
to influence the outcome of the island's first popular presidential
election. Forex reserves plummeted to US$82.55 billion then, down
from US$90.08 billion in the previous month.</P>
      <P>This year, after the cross-Taiwan Strait tensions eased, forex
reserves gradually rebounded to reach US$90.08 billion and US$90.02
billion in May and June respectively.</P>

(By Chang Lung &amp; Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Officials from mainland China's Central
Office for Taiwan Affairs (COTA) on Thursday denied reports that
Beijing will refuse to negotiate with Taiwan for the remainder of
Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui's tenure.</P>
      <P>The officials remarked that promoting political negotiations
across the Taiwan Strait is and will remain of utmost significance to
Beijing, and that this cannot be done without talking to Taipei.</P>
      <P>Reports had quoted former US Assistant Secretary of State for
Asian Affairs John Holdrige as saying he had been told by Xiong
Guangkai, deputy chief of the general staff of the People's
Liberation Army and military representative to COTA, that as long as
Lee Teng-hui remains the ROC president, it is unlikely talks between
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait can be resumed.</P>
      <P>Informed sources in Beijing say that although some Communist
officials have no desire to deal with Lee, such opinions do not
reflect the mainstream point of view among the leadership hierarchy.</P>
      <P>Observers also point out that while Lee has only two and a half
years remaining in his second and final term as ROC president, he has
another four years left as the recently re-elected chairman of the
ruling Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>And, while mainland China's President Jiang Zemin was recently
re-elected as general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party for

head of state or as the KMT party leader.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  24 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew on Friday reaffirmed
the government's determination to improve social order and urged the
public to give officials "more time" to produce results.</P>
      <P>Siew made the remarks in a question-and-answer session at the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Siew admitted that social order has not seen marked improvement
over recent months, but said that the current problems likewise did
not arise overnight. Rather, as they are related to complex political
and social changes occurring after the lifting of the martial law in
Taiwan, Siew appealed for a little more time to deal with the
problem.</P>
      <P>Noting that he has focused on bettering social order through both
short- and long-term approaches since assuming his post in September,
Siew said a spiritual revitalization is also crucial to the
improvement of social order.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan passed several measures on police
administrative reforms in a floor meeting Thursday. These included
upgrading the ability of law enforcement officials to investigate and
prevent criminal cases, expanding the rank-and-file police force,
beefing up marine security, and sending officials overseas to German
and Japan to observe police administrative reforms in those
countries.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the brutal murder of plastic surgeon Fang Pao-fang,
his wife and a nurse at a Taipei clinic Thursday afternoon shocked
the nation and dominated discussions in the legislative session on
Friday.</P>
      <P>The murder of the three victims, all found blindfolded, bound,
gagged and shot with a single bullet to the head at close range,
recalled the gangland-style killing of former Taoyuan Magistrate Liu
Pan-you and seven others at his residence in November 1996.</P>
      <P>Legislator Peng Shau-ching of the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party asked Interior Minister Yeh Chin-feng and National
Police Administration Director-General Ting Yuan-ching to step down
if they fail to solve the latest high-profile murder case within two
weeks.</P>
      <P>Peng said the fact that the killings took place in broad
daylight, and that the clinic is located on Roosevelt Road near the
Presidential Office, Judicial Yuan and the Ministry of Justice, shows
the degree of both the ruthlessness and the audacity of the killers.</P>
      <P>Peng claimed that criminal elements have familiarized themselves
with the methods used in the Liu murders, but that police have yet to
learn how to solve such cases. He said Taiwan has become a haven for
criminals, with a helpless government and a fearful public.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEE WARNS OF TROUBLE OVER TAIWAN ISSUE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore, Oct. 24 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore's Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew
said in Boston on Thursday that there is still some danger of trouble
with mainland China over deeply emotional issues like Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He served the warning in his speech to a Fortune 500 Forum on the
subject, "The Prospects for East Asia."</P>
      <P>"No (mainland) Chinese leader can afford to be branded as the man
who lost Taiwan," he said. "But the danger of a military conflict
between China and the United States is low.</P>
      <P>"Chinese leaders know that US military superiority is
overwhelming, and will remain so for the next few decades," he told
an audience of business leaders and CEOs from the top 500 companies
in the United States.</P>
      <P>"They will modernize their forces not to challenge America but to
be able, if necessary, to pressure Taiwan by a blockade, or otherwise
to destabilize the economy," Lee asserted.</P>
      <P>He said mainland China wants to grow quickly to become "an
industrial power within 30 years."</P>
      <P>"Their market may become as big as America's, enough to give it
leverage over the countries of East and Southeast Asia," he pointed
out. "This is the area in which China can increase its influence."</P>
      <P>Speaking of relations between the Washington and Beijing, Lee
said he believes the signs are good for a period of "workmanlike
relations" between the two.</P>
      <P>"A stable relationship is possible and confrontation need never
happen because both the United States and China want to avoid
confrontation and its costly consequences," he said.</P>
      <P>He was of the view that mainland China's challenge is "to reassure
the world, especially its neighbors, that a resurgent China will be a
responsible one."</P>
      <P>Membership of international organizations like the World Trade
Organization (WTO) is essential to ensuring that mainland China
becomes a responsible member of the international community as it
becomes a major stakeholder in the key institutions of the post-Cold
War era, he said.</P>
      <P>Lee also noted that US policy on mainland China has gradually
taken shape. "President Clinton's stated policy is engagement in
depth. At the same time, he has strengthened ties with Japan in the
US-Japan Defense Guidelines and increased its access to bases in the
region," he said.</P>
      <P>Mainland China has been outspoken in its opposition to this
extension of the US-Japan security pact but will tolerate the present
arrangements, he added.</P>
      <P>Mainland China too is courting members of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) so that they will stay "neutral" in
any US-China dispute, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>It is against this background that ASEAN countries have to seek
stability and growth, Lee stressed, noting that the original five
countries of ASEAN were brought together by the common enemy of
communism.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the present nine member countries of ASEAN do
not have a common enemy to unite them. "If China is prudent and
tactful, there will be none," he observed.</P>
      <P>"On issues involving its sovereignty, like Taiwan, Tibet and Hong
Kong, ASEAN will not want to be involved," he said. "Over the
Spratlys, ASEAN cannot remain neutral," he added.</P>
      <P>On other issues, he asserted, ASEAN is likely to be torn between
two strong currents: "the need to retain American presence, and the
need to develop a viable long-term relationship with a huge
neighbor."</P>
      <P>He pointed out that ASEAN's ties with and leanings towards
America derive from the long period of the Cold War. "It is in US
interests to preserve these ties," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US WANTS TO ENGAGE AS WELL AS DETER PLA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  23 (CNA)
(By Bill Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Washington's military engagement with
Beijing is aimed at both articulating US policies and intentions and
demonstrating US military capabilities in order to deter the People's
Liberation Army "in the event of the relationship going in the
direction no one wants," a US defense official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Randall Schriver, senior country director for mainland China,
Taiwan, Hong Kong and Mongolia in the Office of the Secretary of
Defense, told a briefing sponsored by the US Institute of Peace on
the Oct. 29 summit between President Bill Clinton and mainland
Chinese President Jiang Zemin that "it is important for them (the
PLA) to understand our capabilities and know what we can bring to
bear on a situation which would involve conflict that, again, no one
wants."</P>
      <P>Schriver said that Washington's objectives for a military
relationship with Beijing have been consistent, among which are
developing a better understanding of PLA's modernization efforts,
pursuing the relationship to sustain the support of US allies who do
not want to contain Beijing, and promoting operator-to-operator
dialogue to avoid misunderstanding on the ground.</P>
      <P>In preparing for the summit, Schriver said, the US Defense
Department is working hard on a military maritime safety agreement in
line with the objectives of minimizing misunderstanding and
miscalculations at sea.</P>
      <P>He said that the Pentagon is also trying to articulate the
framework for military contacts between the two sides consisting of
high-level contacts, professional and functional exchanges,
confidence-building measures, and participation in multilateral
forums. "We want to have presidential endorsement so as to allow us
to pursue contacts through that framework."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he said, the Defense Department is working hard trying
to reach an agreement with the PLA on cooperation in humanitarian and
disaster relief which he emphasized is very important as part of
confidence-building measures as well as being a strong signal to the
region that the two sides not only are not adversaries but also can
work together on problems and regional challenges.</P>
      <P>He noted that Washington originally proposed joint humanitarian
relief exercises during mainland Chinese Defense Minister Chi
Haotian's visit here last December but has not been able to get
agreement from the PLA. Now, the US side hopes to institute a gradual
approach beginning with exchange of information and seminars between
the two militaries about their respective experiences.</P>
      <P>While defense officials view the summit as a very important
event, he said, it is also only one event in the Pentagon's very
long-term engagement strategy.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China nationals with a visa to
any of the seven Schengen Convention countries will be able to make
visa-free visits to Italy starting Oct. 26, a senior official of the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Friday.</P>
      <P>R.T. Yang, director of the ministry's European Affairs
Department, told a routine news conference that Italy will begin to
implement the Schengen Convention on Oct. 26.</P>
      <P>"The Italian Economic and Cultural Promotion Office, which
represents Italian interests in Taipei in the absence of formal
diplomatic ties, has informed us that ROC passport holders with a
visa to any of the countries that are signatories to the Schengen
Convention can enter Italy freely from Oct. 26," Yang said.</P>
      <P>He further said the Italian representative office has promised to
begin issuing "Schengen" visas to ROC nationals as soon as possible.
Once this is done, ROC citizens who obtain a visa to visit Italy will
also be able to visit any of the seven other Schengen Convention
countries -- the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Spain, Portugal,
Germany and France.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Yang said, the Italian government has announced that
ROC nationals who have been granted the right to reside in Italy will
no longer need to apply for an entry visa if they want to re-enter
that country after a short leave.</P>
      <P>"We welcome this new measure," Yang said, adding it is expected
to help boost bilateral exchanges and reinforce substantive
relations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER DIPLOMAT WARNS OF PROBLEMS IN CLINTON-JIANG TALKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct.  24  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A potential blowup on the Korean
Peninsula, the stability of the Taiwan Strait and the threat to
democracy in Hong Kong are serious issues which will face US
President Bill Clinton and mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin in
their talks next week in Washington.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's
"Late Line" program Thursday night, former US Ambassador to
mainland China James Lilley sounded out that warning ahead of the
Clinton-Jiang summit.</P>
      <P>"We have very serious problems with China that we have to get on
... and the No. 1 priority is dealing with North Korea," Lilley said.
"I can tell you, if you don't (resolve them), two to three million
people will lose human rights that could cause deaths. You have to
deal with that now."</P>
      <P>Next in line comes the issues of the stability of the Taiwan
Strait, the threat to democracy in Hong Kong, trade issues, nuclear
proliferation and the Tibetan problem.</P>
      <P>Also being interviewed in the same program, Australia's former
Prime Minister Bob Hawke agreed with Lilley's views that the problems
involving North Korea and the stability of Taiwan are very serious.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same program, Nancy Pelosi, a Democratic member
of the US House of Representatives, said: "It is inappropriate to
give red carpet treatment to the head of a regime that continues to
violate human rights and abuses in mainland China and in Tibet, and
continues to proliferate the weapons of mass destruction."</P>
      <P>In a blunt remark, Lilley said: "We got to get the Japan-US
security treaty understood by China and perhaps even bring China into
talks as a partner into the triangular relationship."</P>
      <P>He said mainland China, the United States, Japan and South Korea
are the keys to resolving the North Korean problem. "The sooner they
solve the problem, the better. And China has to be a partner," he
said.</P>
      <P>Lilley said another critical issue between Clinton and Jiang will
be the security and prosperity of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"We almost had a shootout there in March 1996. And finally I have
one point to make -- that is, we have got an experiment going in Hong
Kong where democracy is under threat," he said.</P>
      <P>He noted that although prosperity is being maintained after the
handover of the former British colony to mainland China, "it seems to
me that is crucial to watch closely. And I don't think they know
which direction they will go, whether it is going to change China or
whether Hong Kong will change or both will change."</P>
      <P>Lilley said China always gives the US lectures about its "unity,
sovereignty, and Taiwan."</P>
      <P>"The Chinese give us moralistic lessons almost every day. We get
sermons on sovereignty, unity ... we get these lectures constantly,"
he said.</P>
      <P>"And when they (China) start talking about sovereignty and
Taiwan, we talk about human rights and democracy, Hong Kong, Taiwan
and China.</P>
      <P>"It seems to me now that we've got other subjects to deal about
-- nuclear proliferation, trade and North Korea and the stability in
the Taiwan Strait -- that sort of things is the real issue," Lilley
said.</P>
      <P>On the issue of human rights, Tibet and other problems, Hawke
disagreed with both Lilley and Pelosi. He said the Washington has to
discuss the problems with mainland China through bilateral dialogues
instead of public platforms.</P>
      <P>"There is no difference that we have the same objective and we
want to achieve our objective," Hawke said. "But we are much more
likely to achieve our objective if we don't get on our platform and
preach them (China) moralities, but recognize the cultural
differences of China," Hawke said.</P>
      <P>Pelosi disagreed with Hawke's views, saying the United States is
not preaching its values to mainland China. Rather, "we are only
saying to China that your own constitution gives certain guaranty to
your people."</P>
      <P>"We are talking about honoring your constitution and hopefully
honoring the declaration of human rights because China is a signatory
of the declarations of human rights," Pelosi said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POTENTIAL AGENDA JIANG-CLINTON SUMMIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  Oct.  23  (CNA)
(By David Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Less than a week before Jiang Zemin's
summit with US President Bill Clinton in Washington, a noted US
scholar on Asian affairs warns that the meeting should not be
expected to solve a multitude of difficult, often intractable, issues
and disputes between the United States and China.</P>
      <P>In a 25-page Asia Update entitled "The 1997 Sino-American
Summit," published this week by the New York-based Asia Society,
David Shambaugh, professor of political science and international
affairs at George Washington University, points out that historical
experience suggests that "expectations should not be falsely raised,
as they often go unfulfilled, leaving Beijing and Washington blaming
each other for retrogression."</P>
      <P>It is unlikely that the two sides will produce a joint
communique, but they are likely to release a joint public statement
and hold a news conference with the two presidents, Shambaugh
predicts. "One unresolved issue about the public statement is how the
two sides should characterize their relationship, i.e. whether to
define it as a 'partnership' and, if so, what kind?" he says, adding
that the terms "strategic partnership" (which China has used to
describe its relations with Russia and France) and "constructive
partnership" are being considered.</P>
      <P>According to Shambaugh, who is presently working on a book
entitled "China's Military Enters the 21st Century, " the potential
agenda for the Jiang-Clinton summit can be divided into two
categories: "action items," involving agreements that will likely be
reached, and broader issues for discussion, over which differences
exist or where cooperation will be sought.</P>
      <P>He lists the likely "action items" as including:</P>
      <P>--an agreement to regularize and enhance strategic dialogue
between the two governments, including agreement to hold regular
annual summit meetings between heads of state, as well as regular
consultations in each capital between foreign and defense ministers
and their principal deputies;</P>
      <P>--a new and expanded set of military-to-military exchanges;</P>
      <P>--a Military Maritime Cooperation Agreement;</P>
      <P>--the reiteration that the US-China relationship should be
governed by the three existing joint communiques (of 1972, 1979,
1982), including the "one China" principle;</P>
      <P>--a Chinese agreement to buy up to 30 Boeing aircraft, and
perhaps other large commercial deals;</P>
      <P>--the implementation of the 1985 US-China Nuclear Cooperation
Accord.</P>
      <P>--the establishment of a "communications link" (a.k.a. hotline)
between the two presidents.</P>
      <P>--the establishment of a bilateral Human Rights Commission to be
administered by nongovernmental organizations, and the implementation
of a regular human rights dialogue between the two governments.</P>
      <P>--the possible reactivation of activities in mainland China by the
US government's Trade and Development Agency and the Overseas Private
Investment Corporation, as well as the extension of Export-Import
Bank financing for US companies doing business in mainland China. All
of these activities were suspended as part of the 1989 post-Tiananmen
sanctions;</P>
      <P>--an agreement to bolster US support for development of
mainland China's legal system;</P>
      <P>--an agreement to bolster US support for pollution abatement
programs in mainland China;</P>
      <P>--an agreement to cooperate in drug enforcement and other joint
measures to combat organized crime;</P>
      <P>--an agreement to broaden cooperation and research in space
technology; and</P>
      <P>--a stated commitment to deepen academic exchanges and expand the
Fulbright program.</P>
      <P>However, Shambaugh noted, behind these anticipated agreements and
action items, each side has an agenda of "deeper and more troubling
issues."</P>
      <P>As the author of "The 1997 Sino-American Summit" sees it, it
would seem likely that the Chinese government will come to the summit
with a slate of items on their broad agenda with the United States.
They include lifting the remaining Tiananmen sanctions and a US
agreement to drop its annual attempt to pass a resolution condemning
mainland China's human rights conditions at the United Nations Human
Rights Commission in Geneva.</P>

      <P>Some Southeast Asian countries have
approached the Republic of China for assistance in addressing their
financial crises in recent months, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs
official said on Friday.</P>
      <P>"Since the outbreak of the Southeast Asian financial turmoil in

ministry's East Asian and Pacific Affairs Department.</P>
      <P>Chang said those countries have expressed the hope that the ROC
offers them loans to help prop up their currencies.</P>
      <P>"In consideration of our own financial situation and the
fact that the ROC is not a member of the International Monetary Fund

issue," Chang said, adding: "We think it is better that such
assistance is offered through international organizations."</P>

    <HEADLINE>XIAMEN TO HOST CROSS-STRAIT TRADE AND COMMERCE SYMPOSIUM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Beijing,  Oct. 24 (CNA)
(By Chang Lung &amp; Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The "Cross-century Symposium on Trade and
Commerce Across the Taiwan Strait" to be held in the mainland city of
Xiamen, Fujian Province, Dec. 7-9 is likely to have an impact on
Taipei's "no haste, be patient" policy regarding Taiwan's
reunification with mainland China.</P>
      <P>This will be the year's largest meeting concerning cross-strait
relations to be sponsored by mainland China, and it is expected to
provide guideposts of Beijing's efforts to get cross-strait talks
back on track.</P>
      <P>Especially noteworthy is the fact that Chiao Jen-ho,
secretary-general and vice chairman of Taiwan's Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF), has been invited to the symposium even though the
protocol dialogue between the two sides has not yet resumed.</P>
      <P>This indicates that Beijing is trying to use trade and commerce
to make a breakthrough in cross-strait relations. By doing so,
Beijing can on the one hand make its own Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) and Taipei's SEF work with each
other again, and on the other can put some pressure on Taipei's "no
haste, be patient" policy.</P>
      <P>The symposium, sponsored by ARATS and backed by the All-China
Federation of Taiwan Compatriots and other mainland organizations,
has been organized by ARATS Executive Vice Chairman Tang Shubei, who
will take part in the meeting from beginning to end. It has not yet
been announced whether or not ARATS Chairman Wang Daohan will also
attend.</P>
      <P>The meeting is a step toward Beijing's goals of negating Taipei's
"no haste, be patient" policy and achieving "the political goal (of
Taiwan's reunification with mainland China) through trade and
commercial pressure."</P>

    <HEADLINE>PM SIEW: IT IS BEIJING THAT HINDERS "THREE DIRECT LINKS"</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  24  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew said Friday that it
is Beijing that hinders the opening of direct transportation,
communication, and trade links between Taiwan and the Chinese
mainland.</P>
      <P>Answering a question by Legislator Chen Chi-mai (DPP-Kaohsiung
City), Siew said that, for the sake of national interest and
security, the government must ban the "three direct links" at the
present time.</P>
      <P>He said only on the basis of mutual trust and mutual benefit
can the three links perform normally.</P>
      <P>The premier said that he is not opposed to the opening of
the three direct links, and that he fully understands the business
sector's hope for an early lifting of the ban. "But we have to wait
until the time is ripe, otherwise it would be very dangerous to us."</P>
      <P>Taiwan has banned direct trade, communication, and
transportation links with mainland China since Communist troops
occupied the mainland in 1949. Beijing has stepped up its efforts to
push for the opening of the three links in recent years.</P>
      <P>Siew said the time to open the direct links is not ripe
because Beijing still harbors hostile attitude toward Taiwan. He
urged those who hope for an early opening of the direct links go to
the other side of the Taiwan Strait and say the obstacle to doing so
lies in Beijing. (by Ed Hsieh)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislator Parris Hsu-cheng Chang Friday
urged the government not to neglect the possible effect of mainland
Chinese President Jiang Zemin's visit to Washington next week.</P>
      <P>At the "Forum on National Affairs" of the Legislative Yuan,
Chang described the visit as the beginning of "a second
normalization" of the relations between mainland China and the
United States. He said the two countries may hold summit meetings
each year from now on, and the relations between them may improve
substantially.</P>
      <P>Chang, who is also the representative of the Democratic
Progressive Party to the United States, said mainland Chinese
leaders are trying to influence American political leaders' attitude
toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said that, although the U.S. government has made it clear
that Washington and Beijing are not going to sign a "fourth
communique" during Jiang's state visit to Washington, a "statement"
may be issued at the end of his visit, and the statement may include
a "Taiwan clause."</P>
      <P>In the statement, Beijing could reiterate its principle of "one
China," urge Washington to refrain from supporting Taiwan's bid to
join the United Nations, and ask Washington not to support Taiwan
independence, the lawmaker of Taiwan's major opposition party said.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan should not neglect mainland Chinese activities in
the United States, because Beijing wants to persuade Washington into
endorsing its "unification policy" toward Taiwan, make Taiwan look
like an obstacle to the development of U.S. relations with mainland
China, and eventually cut off Taiwan's lifeline. (by Ed Shay)</P>

    <HEADLINE>S'PORE ISSUES NEW PORNOGRAPHY GUIDELINES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Oct.  23  (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Singapore Broadcasting Authority
(SBA) reiterated Thursday that the target of its war on the Internet
is pornography.</P>
      <P>Since the SBA knows, however, that it would be impossible to
block access to the proliferation of pornographic sites on the Net,
it will focus instead on stopping pornographic sites which children
can reach easily, said SBA chief executive officer Lim Hock Chuan on
Thursday.</P>
      <P>"The SBA is not out to eliminate all these sites, that is
certainly not the way we approach the regulation of the Internet," he
said.</P>
      <P>He estimated that there are almost a million pornographic sites
in the world, with about 25 million pages devoted to sexual content.</P>
      <P>To give the local Internet industry and surfers a clear idea of
what the SBA considers obscene and pornographic, the authority has
released more specific guidelines, including listing several forms of
sexual perversion in the new Internet Code of Practice, which was
released Thursday.</P>
      <P>For instance, pornographic content has been clarified to include
material that depicts nudity or genitalia, or of people clearly
engaged in sex, "in a manner calculated to titillate."</P>
      <P>This does not include content that has an "intrinsic medical,
scientific, artistic or educational value."</P>
      <P>The new code also spells out what it considers to be sex with
children.</P>
      <P>Previously, pedophilia was mentioned in passing. But under the
new code it is defined as any content on sexual activity with "a
person who is, or appears to be, under 16 years of age."</P>
      <P>The revised code also adds three more areas of sexual content to
its list of sexual perversions not seen in the earlier version:
incest, bestiality and necrophilia.</P>
      <P>While the SBA does not have any employees dedicated to sniffing
out pornographic sites, it has eight staff members who, aside from
their own duties, also surf the Internet regularly, Lim said, adding
that if any objectionable sites based in other countries are
uncovered, local Internet service providers would then be asked to
filter the offending sites from the public.</P>
      <P>About 100 sites have so far been banned.</P>
      <P>If the site is hosted in Singapore, then the owner of the site
would be asked to remove the prohibited content. To refuse is to risk
a fine, he said.</P>
      <P>However, Lim said that the SBA has never used its legal powers in
this regard. In the four instances when prohibited material was found
on local sites, the content was always removed promptly, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT LEE ATTENDS RECEPTION MARKING RETROCESSION DAY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 24 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui attended a cocktail
reception hosted by the Taiwan Provincial Government (TPG) in
Chunghsing New Village in central Taiwan on Friday to mark the 52nd
anniversary of the retrocession of Taiwan to the Republic of China
after 50 years of Japanese colonial rule.</P>
      <P>Lee said he was delighted to attend the reception on the eve of
Taiwan Retrocession Day, which falls on Oct. 25.</P>
      <P>The president lauded all the people of the island for their
diligence and devotion to helping develop Taiwan from a poor agrarian
society to an economic powerhouse in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>This is the first time that Lee, who once served as governor of
Taiwan, has attended Retrocession Day celebrations since the central
government decided to downsize the provincial government.</P>
      <P>Lee took the opportunity to explain the main purpose of this
policy. "The streamlining of the provincial government is primarily
aimed at minimizing the overlapping of functions of government
agencies at different levels so as to cut red tape and enhance
administrative efficiency," the president said, adding that the
decision is the result of a national consensus.</P>
      <P>Noting that the staff of the provincial government staff is a
valuable workforce, Lee said the government will make the best
possible arrangement for all the 120,000 TPG employees.</P>
      <P>The president further said the TPG streamlining is only part of a
comprehensive government restructuring plan aimed at trimming the
government hierarchy and upgrading the country's international
competitiveness.</P>
      <P>According to a package of constitutional amendments passed in
July this year, all provincial-level elections will be suspended
after the current terms expire late next year.</P>
      <P>Lee admitted that the TPG downsizing involves many difficult and
complicated problems. "For the sake of our country's long-term
development, we should overcome all obstacles and work hand-in-hand
to ensure the smooth implementation of the streamlining plan."</P>
      <P>The president went on to say he appreciates the devoted service
of the TPG staff and the Taiwan Provincial Assembly over the years.
"Our country needs your continued services. I hope all of you will
stand united and cooperate closely with the central government to
complete various ambitious trans-century construction and reform
projects."</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Taiwan Governor James Soong, who
was vehemently opposed to the TPG downsizing plan but threw his
support behind the project after the National Assembly passed the
related constitutional amendments, said that over the past five
decades the TPG has consistently cooperated with the central
government to build the island into a prosperous economy.</P>
      <P>Soong said that while he does not oppose overall government
restructuring in order to upgrade government efficiency, "the
restructuring plan should be drafted jointly by the central,
provincial and other local-level government agencies to ensure its
feasibility and perfection."</P>
      <P>Vice Premier John Chang, Haitian Ambassador Sonny Seraphin and
many other senior central, provincial, city and county government
officials, provincial assembly deputies, county councilors and
representatives of social groups also attended the cocktail
reception.</P>

      <P>Vice President Lien Chan on Friday called
on the international community to make investments in Taiwan and
stressed the Republic of China government's determination to step up
cultural development.</P>
      <P>While meeting with Albert Roynolds, who served as Ireland's prime
minister from 1992 to 1994 and is currently a member of parliament,
Lien expressed the hope that Irish enterprises can invest in Taiwan,
noting economic liberalization and globalization are set policies of
the ROC government.</P>
      <P>Lien told Roynolds that the ROC government has been actively
pushing for the privatization of its state-run firms and that it
welcomes foreign companies to take part in the drive.</P>
      <P>This was the second meeting between Lien and Roynolds. They first
met when Lien visited Ireland in June.</P>
      <P>Later, in a meeting with David Rockefellor Jr., president of the
US-based Asian Culture Council (ACC), Lien stressed the ROC
government's determination to boost Taiwan's developments of cultural
activities in an effort to upgrade the island's quality of life.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan's annual per-capita income has hit US$13,000,
Lien said, the spiritual dimension of Taiwan people's lives needs to
be further elevated.</P>
      <P>For his part, Rockefellor said the ACC is very willing to
strengthen cultural and artistic exchanges with the ROC in order to
boost mutual understanding and communication between the people of
the two countries.</P>
      <P>Rockefellor was accompanied by Douglas Hsu, president of
the ROC-US Asian Culture Foundation, while Vice Presidential
Secretary-General Su Chi was also present.</P>

      <P>The following are excerpts from an

daily, the China Post.</P>
      <P>The Criticism of CBC Policy</P>
      <P>The Central Bank of China (CBC) has in recent months remained a
target of harsh criticism in the media, first for its persistent
defense of the New Taiwan dollar and more recently for its sudden
abandonment of the battle to let the local currency determine its own
value in accord with supply and demand.</P>
      <P>What (CBC Governor) Sheu (Yuan-dong) and his colleagues failed to
recognize beforehand was an unexpected effect that the neighboring
market crisis had on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The authorities at the CBC had thought that the Southeast Asian
markets' financial problems would be brought under control quickly
with the aid of the International Monetary Fund.</P>
      <P>But to the disappointment of the CBC, the Thai government, when
it announced a long-awaited crisis-tackling package in late
September, failed to restore market confidence and, as a result,
sparked a new round of speculative currency attacks.</P>
      <P>When the CBC kept selling greenbacks to safeguard the value of
the NT dollar, the bank was actually creating a ground for a growing
crunch in local currency funds and, because of this, a surge in
interest rates. A tightening money market not only hit investors, but
also put additional pressure on an already falling stock exchange. So
investors and stock buyers all vented their anger at the CBC.</P>
      <P>However, the legislative request for Sheu's resignation and some
of the criticism leveled at him ... do not seem to be entirely
justifiable. No central bank in the world would stand idly by when a
nation's currency comes under unreasonable speculative attacks.</P>
      <P>Should Governor Sheu finally step down under pressure from
legislators and others, it would seriously undermine the credibility
of the CBC, an institution which is supposed to function
independently from political influence. ... If the CBC must listen to
politicians, its governor would never be able to make independent
judgments in setting monetary policies.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US, MAINLAND NUCLEAR COOPERATION NEEDS TO BE CLOSELY WATCHED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  24  (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign Minister Jason Hu said on Friday
that talks regarding nuclear cooperation at the upcoming summit
meeting between the United States and mainland China need to be
closely monitored.</P>
      <P>Hu said that US President Bill Clinton and his mainland China
counterpart Jiang Zemin are expected to reach several agreements at
the summit meeting on Oct. 29, including maritime military
cooperation aimed at teaming-up marine rescue efforts and non-nuclear
proliferation cooperation.</P>
      <P>Hu made the marks while answering questions from legislators who
expressed concern that nuclear cooperation between the US and the
mainland will have profound impact on the military balance in the
western Pacific Ocean over the next 10 or 20 years.</P>
      <P>Despite a Washington-Beijing nuclear cooperation agreement signed
12 years ago to facilitate the exchange of nuclear cooperation and
technology for peaceful purposes, the US government has never issued
any permits allowing any such exports to the mainland for fear that
the mainland authorities might fail to honor the agreement and
transfer the technology to the manufacture of nuclear weapons, Hu
said.</P>
      <P>But now American people feel that the mainland authorities seem
to realize that they have an obligation to observe international
practices with regard to the control of radioactive materials, or
they will also become a victim, Hu said, noting that the US and the
mainland have a chance of reaching a new nuclear cooperation
agreement at the summit talks which will mean that the US government
will agree to put the previously-signed pact into effect.</P>
      <P>Hu said that if the agreement promotes the export of nuclear
power facilities to the mainland, the ecological environment is also
sure to be affected to some degree.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POULTRY FARMERS HURT BY EGG OVER-PRODUCTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  24  (CNA)
(By H.C.M.)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An over-production of eggs has hurt
Taiwan's poultry farmers, an official of the Chinese Poultry Farmers
Association said on Friday.</P>
      <P>He said egg prices in Taiwan have fallen drastically this year
due to over-production and are currently at around NT$1 (about 3 US
cents) apiece on the local market, which is lower than actual
production costs of about NT$1.6 (5 US cents).</P>
      <P>As a result, almost all the island's 1,700 poultry farmers are
losing money, the official said.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Shih-chuan, one of Taiwan's principal poultry farmers, has
a laying flock of 300,000 hens that are kept in computerized chicken
shelters and produce high-quality eggs which have been well received
in the market. But he said that he too has been suffering as a result
of the low prices.</P>
      <P>At present, there are some 27 million hens in Taiwan, producing
76,500 crates of eggs (about 15 million eggs) per day. However,
current daily demand in Taiwan is for only about 60,000 crates, with
more than 200,000 crates already in stock.</P>
      <P>Because of this heavy financial pressure, some poultry farmers
have already started working on ways to resolve the over-production
problem, with plans which include the elimination of some three
million of the less-productive hens, egg-promotion campaigns aimed at
the general public and the development of the egg-processing industry
to handle the extra eggs.</P>

(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A ranking official with mainland China's
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) denied on
Friday that ARATS Vice Chairman Tang Shubei has said that Beijing
will not have any contact with ROC President Lee Teng-hui.</P>
      <P>A Washington Post dispatch from Beijing on Oct. 22 said that
during an interview with the US paper at his Beijing office on Oct.
14, Tang said that Beijing will have no contact with Lee and that
the so-called "Taiwan issue" will not be solved in the next two years
while Lee is still in power.</P>
      <P>ARATS is the mainland organization in charge of handling
exchanges with Taiwan in the absence of official contact.</P>
      <P>The official, who asked not to be named and was also present at
the Oct. 14 interview, said that Tang didn't make the remarks.</P>
      <P>Tang simply reiterated the calls made by mainland President
Jiang Zemin at last month's 15th National Congress of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) that both Taiwan and the mainland should return
to the negotiating table to work out a way to "end the hostility
across the Taiwan Strait under the `one China' principle," according
to the official.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) questioned a
similar remark made by Xiong Guangkai, the People's Liberation Army's
deputy chief of general staff, that Beijing will not conduct any
dialogue with Taiwan while Lee is in office.</P>
      <P>Xiong's remarks contradict the statement made by Jiang at the CCP
congress, said MAC Vice Chairman Hsu Ke-sheng.</P>
      <P>Mainland Vice Premier Zhu Rongji has also urged both sides to
make arrangements for the opening of political negotiations,
indicating that Beijing is still seeking dialogue with Taipei, he
added.</P>
      <P>But if the remarks by Tang and Xiong are true, then Taipei will
consider Beijing insincere in proposing the dialogue, Hsu added.</P>

      <P>The population in the Taiwan area stood at
21.61 million as of the end of September, according to statistics
compiled by the Ministry of the Interior.</P>
      <P>This figure, which was released on the eve of the Taiwan
Restoration Day, is more than three times that of 50 years ago.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was ceded to Japan in 1895 following China's defeat in the
first Sino-Japanese war (1894-95). The island was restored to China
on Oct. 25, 1945 after Japan's surrender at the end of World War II.</P>
      <P>A census conducted in 1946 indicated that there were 6.09 million
people in the Taiwan area, for a population density of 169 persons
per square kilometer, compared with the present 600 persons.</P>
      <P>With improvements in the standard of living and better medical
care, the life span in Taiwan has also greatly extended during the

men and 56.3 years for women, but this has now risen to 71.9 years
for men and 77.7 years for women, according to the statistics.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's trade deficit with Japan expanded
to US$12.40 billion for the first nine months of this year, up 21.27
percent from the same period of last year, signaling that more effort
should be made to improve the trade imbalance, according to
statistics compiled by customs officials.</P>
      <P>The figure shows that Taiwan exported US$9.0 billion-worth of
goods to Japan during the nine-month period, a decline of 13.31
percent from the year-earlier level, while imports from Japan
increased 3.8 percent to reach US$21.47 billion.</P>
      <P>Two-way trade with Japan accounted for 17.47 of Taiwan's total
trade with foreign countries, which stood at US$174.1 billion as of
the end of September.</P>
      <P>Customs officials attributed the drop in exports to Japan to the
ban on pork exports to Japan due to the March epidemic of
foot-and-mouth disease on the island. The depreciation of the
Japanese yen was also one of the leading factors that reduced imports
from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The five leading categories enjoying the largest percentage
growth in exports to Japan were: steel and related products; optical
instruments; seafood; porcelain; and electrical engineering products,
while the top five import items in terms of percentage gains were:
precious stones; gold; electrical engineering products; processed
foods and drinks; and communications products.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Following similar moves by neighboring
countries, Taiwan's Chunghwa Telecom Co., Ltd. announced on Friday
that it will take court action against a United States Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) order to cut international settlement
rates on overseas calls.</P>
      <P>Chunghwa Telecom said that reforms of settlement rates should be
based on a global basis and that the FCC's unilateral decision to set
up benchmark levels without specific cost data is a violation of
other countries' jurisdictions, adding that Japan's KDD, Hong Kong's
HKTI and Singapore's ST have filed lawsuits against the FCC's policy
order.</P>
      <P>Settlement rates are the amounts telephone companies charge each
other to complete link-ups of international calls.</P>
      <P>The FCC announced on Aug. 28 that it will continue with its plan
to cut the rates by up to 70 percent starting in January 1999 at the
latest, setting lower benchmarks for international settlement rates
in a bid to reduce a US$5.5 billion payment deficit by US phone
companies to their foreign counterparts.</P>
      <P>The decision imposes a ceiling on the settlement rates which US
carriers have to pay other regional telecommunications operators.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan, along with Japan, Singapore and Hong Kong, are
categorized as high-income nations by the FCC, settlement fees paid
to telecommunications operators of these countries will be reduced
from the current US$0.57 per minute to just US$0.15.</P>
      <P>If the FCC implements the new move, Taiwan will see a loss of
about NT$2.6 billion in international settlement rates each year,
Chunghwa Telecom estimated, as the number of calls from the US to
Taiwan is greater than the number made from Taiwan to the US.</P>

      <P>On the eve of the 52nd anniversary of
Taiwan's retrocession, President Lee Teng-hui on Friday urged his
countrymen to recreate the successful past experience of Taiwan by
embarking on a course of spiritual reform.</P>
      <P>In a nationally televised message, Lee said that any kind of
reform has its origin in the spirit and called on the people of
Taiwan to base their relationships on kindness and affection, respect
and caring, to abide by the law, to enrich the meaning of their lives
through industriousness, to improve their potential through improved
efficiency and to enhance the social harmony through dialogue and
cooperation.</P>
      <P>"In order to create a brighter prospect for the nation, to
develop a more beautiful homeland for our future generations," Lee
said, "we should work together to pursue our goals."</P>
      <P>The president pointed out that the Taiwan experience was molded
out of the "Taiwan spirit" -- made up of the people's undauntedness,
their refusal to concede defeat, their honesty, hard work and
thriftiness -- and the "Taiwan vision," -- a peace-loving and
tolerant attitude. It is the Taiwan spirit and Taiwan vision that
developed into what he called "gemeinschaft", or "everybody in the
same boat, pulling together," which has helped the country overcome
numerous hardship and challenges over the last 52 years.</P>
      <P>He encouraged his countrymen to help pave the way for the
country's long-lasting peace and prosperity via reforms of the
Constitution, administration, judiciary and education system.</P>

      <P>Mainland China's opposition is the main

said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Wang made the remark at a seminar on Taiwan's WTO entry organized

Vincent Siew when he was a legislator.</P>
      <P>A WTO official in charge of admission affairs who also attended
the seminar praised the sub-group for its efforts to push for
Taiwan's WTO entry and said that the world trade regulatory body's
secretariat will continue to assist Taiwan in its efforts to join.</P>
      <P>Addressing the seminar, Wang indicated that the ROC has in recent
years made great strides in its preparations for WTO entry, including
the opening of its markets and the lowering of trade barriers.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that although most of the bilateral talks between
the ROC and its trade partners on WTO entry have been completed,
seven years after its application for membership of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the WTO's predecessor, the ROC
still cannot be accepted as a WTO member, with the main reason being
opposition from mainland China.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan heavyweight emphasized that the ROC is the

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 24 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In face of mainland China's emergence as a
major market for the US, officials from the ROC Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) on Friday said the government should make it clear to
the US that Taiwan is also an important market for America.</P>
      <P>Although mainland China is emerging as a potential market for the
United States, the officials said the economic potential of Taiwan as
a major market for US products and its plan to become an operations
hub in the Asia-Pacific region are also great.</P>
      <P>Statistics show that Taiwan-based carriers have purchased 39
Boeing airplanes worth US$3.2 billion in recent years and that Taiwan
is the fifth-largest market for US agricultural products. Over the
past seven years, Taiwan has imported a total of US$19.6
billion-worth of farm products from the US, an average of US$2.8
billion per year, in comparison to mainland China's US$530 million.</P>
      <P>Although mainland China is much bigger than Taiwan in terms of
the size of its population and territory, the officials pointed out
that Taiwan's imports of US goods have far exceeded those by the
mainland over the past 10 years.</P>
      <P>As to the possible effects on Taiwan of the upcoming US visit by
mainland China's President Jiang Zemin, the officials predicted that
Jiang's meeting with US President Bill Clinton will have only a
limited impact on Taiwan, as the two sides remain in dispute on a
number of major issues.</P>
      <P>The officials stressed that the Republic of China government has
no intention of meddling in the US' dealings with other countries
and that it will be delighted to see the Clinton-Jiang meeting help
the mainland open up and produce positive results to help stabilize
the situation across the Taiwan Strait and the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>As the ROC government has repeatedly made it clear to Washington
that US engagement with mainland China should not hurt Taiwan's
interests and as Washington has repeatedly assured Taiwan that no
such thing will happen, the MOFA officials said they believe that the
Clinton-Jiang meeting will not damage Taiwan's interests or the
island's relations with the US.</P>

      <P>He asserted that Indonesia's efforts to restore confidence in its
economy will have a positive ripple effect on Southeast Asia, putting
the region back on track in the next few months.</P>
      <P>Indonesia, he said, is negotiating with the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) and will put together and implement a package of
measures that will exercise a positive influence on the Malaysian and
Thai economies as well.</P>
      <P>Singapore offered Indonesia aid to strengthen its foreign
reserves and the rupiah after Prime Minister Goh's meeting with
Indonesian President Suharto on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Singaporean and Indonesian ministers have been directed to work
out ways to implement the agreement, understood to include financial
help.</P>
      <P>Speaking to Singaporean students in London on Wednesday, Goh
noted that the last few months had been bad for the region, with
economic troubles compounded by the haze and accidents such as last
week's oil spill off Singapore's south coast.</P>
      <P>The region's leaders would have to concentrate on changing the
present negative sentiment, he said.</P>
      <P>"It's a question of sentiment, saying the right things and doing
the right things," he was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>The Singapore Trade and Industry Ministry had confirmed that
Singapore was on target to reach about 7 percent growth for the year,
he noted.</P>
      <P>What is uncertain is the outlook for next year, with regional
tourism slowing and Singapore earning less from investments in those
countries, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CLINTON OUTLINES JIANG SUMMIT AGENDA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  24  (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US President Bill Clinton said in a
major speech on Friday that at the summit with his communist Chinese
counterpart next week, he will reiterate US support for the "one
China policy" and the position that the future of Taiwan can only be
settled peacefully by Chinese people on both sides of the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>He noted that the one-China policy, followed by the United States
since 1979, "has allowed democracy to flourish in Taiwan and Taiwan's
relationship with the PRC to grow more stable and prosperous."</P>
      <P>Clinton gave his speech in the auditorium of Voice of America's
head office in Washington. The speech was beamed live through VOC's
broadcasting systems to an estimated 100 million listeners around the
world in seven languages.</P>
      <P>In the speech, designed to set the tone for Clinton's summit with
mainland China's President Jiang Zemin in the White House on Oct. 29,
Clinton stressed that the US does not seek to isolate mainland China,
because such a policy is "unworkable, counterproductive and
potentially dangerous."</P>
      <P>He pointed out that mainland China now stands at a crossroads.
Whether it will emerge as a stable, open, non-aggressive power that
embraces free markets, political pluralism and the rule of law, will
affect the whole world for decades.</P>
      <P>Clinton said his administration intends to work with Beijing to
expand areas of cooperation, while dealing in a forthright manner
with their differences. "Next week, President Jiang and I will
discuss our visions of the future and the kind of strategic
relationship we must have to promote cooperation, not conflict."</P>
      <P>On the subjects on the summit agenda, Clinton said he and Jiang
will discuss the steps they can take together to advance the peace
process on the Korean peninsula. They will also look at ways to
strengthen military-to-military contacts, decreasing the chances of
miscalculation.</P>
      <P>Another important issue to be discussed is how to keep weapons of
mass destruction out of unstable regions and away from rogue states
and terrorists. While acknowledging that mainland China has already
joined a number of international arms control regimes, Clinton
pointed out that Beijing "still maintains some troubling weapon
supply relationships."</P>
      <P>"At the summit, I will discuss with President Jiang further steps
we hope China will take to end or limit some of these supply
relationships and to strengthen and broaden its export control
system," he said.</P>
      <P>Clinton did not name the countries to which mainland China has
supplied dangerous weapons or technology, but it is known that
officials from his administration have been trying hard to persuade
Beijing to stop transferring nuclear technology to Iran and Pakistan.</P>
      <P>Other issues on the agenda include joint efforts to fight drug
trafficking and international organized crime, ways to narrow the
trade imbalance and bring mainland China into the World Trade
Organization, and steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat
global climate change.</P>
      <P>In an apparent effort to silence critics of his soft approach
toward Beijing's human rights abuses, Clinton devoted a major portion
of his speech to the need for political reform to go hand-in-hand
with the economic development in mainland China. He said Beijing has
stifled political dissent in ways which are "fundamentally wrong."
This has caused problems in its relationship with the United States.</P>
      <P>In Clinton's view, greater openness will speed mainland China's
economic growth, enhance its world influence and stabilize its
society.</P>
      <P>"Without the full freedom to think, to question, to create, China
will be at a distinct disadvantage competing with fully open
societies in the Information Age, where the greatest source of
national wealth is what resides in the human mind," he said.</P>
      <P>"China's creative potential is truly staggering. The largest
population in the world is not yet among its top 15 patent powers. In
an era where these human resources are what really matters, a country
that holds its people back cannot achieve its full potential,"
Clinton said.</P>

      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) spokesman
Sheu Ke-sheng on Saturday called once again for the resumption of
cross-Taiwan Strait dialogue to pave the way for peaceful
reunification of China.</P>
      <P>In response to US President Bill Clinton's speech on Friday ahead
of the visit to Washington next week by mainland China's President
Jiang Zemin, in which he mentioned that the "Taiwan issue" should be
solved peacefully by the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait,
Sheu reiterated Taipei's desire to see better relations between
Washington and Beijing.</P>
      <P>Taipei is pleased to see the US and mainland China engaging in
closer exchanges, showcased by Jiang's Oct. 29 visit to the US, Sheu
noted, stressing that friendly Washington-Beijing interactions are
beneficial to the stability and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region
and the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Sheu pointed out that relations among Taiwan, mainland China and
the United States at present run parallel to one another, rather than
forming a single triangle.</P>
      <P>He also urged the US to improve its relations with Taiwan and not

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER DENIES HOLDING UP TALKS ON LINKS WITH BEIJING OVER POLITICS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 25 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew denied on Friday that
the government is holding up talks on direct links with mainland
China as political leverage on Beijing, saying that the time is not
yet ripe for such links.</P>
      <P>Given Beijing's repeated attempts to disrupt the peace across the
Taiwan Strait over the past year, Taipei-Beijing ties are nowhere
near normal and do not warrant direct shipping, communication and
trade links, said Siew at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>In defense of the government's "be patient, no haste" policy to
curb the island's investment in mainland China, Siew said that as a
government with an overall policy of "laissez faire," it should not
and does not prohibit businessmen from venturing into the mainland
China market, but rather relies on moral persuasion on the one hand
to check "unreasonable" local desire for investment in mainland
China, while on the other hand making some industries and areas
off-limits to would-be investors.</P>
      <P>This approach, which he said is also employed by the United
States, doesn't conflict with the administration's stated free trade
policy, according to Siew.</P>
      <P>The premier, who once served as Taiwan's chief official for
mainland affairs, disputed an opposition legislator's criticism that
his administration has failed to come up with a policy for dealing
with Beijing.</P>
      <P>"Responding to Beijing's provocations cautiously to avoid the
further deterioration of the cross-strait situation is in itself a
policy to counter mainland China's strategy," said Siew, adding that
the worldwide call for Beijing to resume friendly dialogue with
Taipei vindicates Taiwan's long-standing policy of engaging mainland
China in peaceful talks.</P>
      <P>He dismissed as a "half-empty, half-full" case the question of
which side -- Taipei or Beijing -- calls the shots in the development
of cross-strait ties, emphasizing that the Beijing regime has come a
long way in relaxing its dictatorship since embarking on the path of
a free market economy 20 years ago. The premier expressed optimism
that the ideals of democracy, freedom and equal distribution of
wealth will eventually take root in mainland China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC URGED TO REVIEW CURRENT MAINLAND CHINA POLICY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>San Francisco, Oct. 25 (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Tien Chang-lin, former chancellor of
the University of California at Berkeley, on Friday urged Taiwan to
review its mainland China and foreign policy on the eve of mainland
China's President Jiang Zemin's visit to the United States.</P>
      <P>Tien said that the Taiwan issue is only a part of the framework
of the strategic partnership between the United States and mainland
China and that the Korean peninsula, the Middle East, nuclear
nonproliferation and trade issues all highlight the importance of
that partnership.</P>
      <P>Referring to the mainland, Tien said that it is undergoing a
series of changes, beginning with the reversion of Hong Kong to
mainland rule in July, followed by the 15th Communist Party congress
in September, Jiang's trip to the US in late October and the choosing
of a candidate for the premiership early next year.</P>
      <P>In view of this, Tien said Taiwan has to take into consideration
the changing world situation and conduct an overall evaluation of
current policy, from the point of view of protecting the
interests of the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On US-mainland China relations, Tien said that despite
differences between the two sides, Jiang's visit to the US and US
President Bill Clinton's scheduled reciprocal visit to the mainland
early next year points to the development of closer relations.</P>
      <P>The US even believes that maintaining good relations with
mainland China is helpful to stability in the Taiwan Strait, Korean
Peninsula and Middle East, Tien said. In this way, Taiwan has to take
into account the three-way interaction among Taipei, Beijing and
Washington.</P>
      <P>Tien, who is a frequent visitor to both Taiwan and mainland
China, said that he mentioned to the ROC government a year ago that
Taiwan has not faced facts in forging some of its policies and that
there should be more than one approach when dealing with cross-strait
relations.</P>
      <P>The former chancellor noted that Taiwan business tycoons such as
Wang Yung-ching of Formosa Plastics Group, Chang Yung-fa of the
Evergreen group and Kao Chin-yen of the President Group, have all
criticized ROC government policy on the ban on "three direct links"
-- trade, postal and transportation -- with the mainland, as well as
its "no haste, be patient" policy toward investing in the mainland.</P>
      <P>Under these circumstances, Tien said, the ROC government should
develop an overall plan regarding trade and investing in the
mainland while stepping up communications with local business
 leaders.</P>
      <P>Tien said that both sides of the Taiwan Strait should also engage
in political negotiations to terminate the current state of
cross-strait hostility, under the "one China" principle championed by
Beijing.</P>
      <P>He said that as a Chinese-American, he is willing to work toward
promoting cross-strait understanding. He is scheduled to leave the US
this weekend to visit Thailand, Taiwan, Hong Kong and mainland China.</P>

      <P>President Idriss Deby of the Republic of
Chad will arrive in Taipei on Sunday for a five-day state visit at
the invitation of ROC President Lee Teng-hui, the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs announced on Saturday.</P>
      <P>This will be Deby's first trip to the Republic of China, the
ministry said in a press release.</P>
      <P>President Lee will preside over a welcoming ceremony with full
military honors, including a 21-gun salute, for the Chad head of
state at the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall complex in downtown
Taipei.</P>
      <P>While here, Deby will meet with Lee to exchange views on the
international situation and matters of mutual concern. He will also
visit several cultural and economic establishments and meet with
local government officials and business leaders to gain a better
understanding of the ROC's economic and cultural development.</P>
      <P>Deby will be accompanied by a 16-member entourage whose members
will include Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation Mahamat
Saleh Annadif and Minister of Finance, Economy, Planning and
Territory Development Biehara Cherif Daoussa.</P>
      <P>Deby won Chad's first post-independence presidential election in
July 1996 and formed a government in May 1997. Under his leadership,
the central African country resumed full-fledged diplomatic relations
with the ROC on Aug. 12, after a 25-year hiatus.</P>
      <P>Chad has a population of about seven million on a land area of
1.28 million square kilometers. Taiwan was Chad's fifth-largest
export market in 1996, purchasing US$4 million-worth of goods, mostly
cotton, which is Chad's principal export item.</P>
      <P>The ROC first established diplomatic ties with Chad in January
1962, but severed those links on Dec. 27, 1972, one month after Chad
signed a communique recognizing the government in Beijing. The two
countries restored diplomatic relations in August this year when Chad
Foreign Minister Mahamat Saleh Annadif visited Taipei and signed a
communique of mutual recognition with then-ROC Minister of Foreign
Affairs John Chang, who is now vice premier.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN MAY GIVE `CONSOLATION MONEY' TO MAINLAND FISHERMEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 25 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan does not rule out the possibility of
giving "consolation money" to mainland Chinese fishermen allegedly
injured by Taiwan marine police in a recent clash in waters off the
island of Matsu, which is controlled by Taiwan but located close to
mainland China, a senior ROC official said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Sheu Ke-sheng, vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC), which charts Taiwan's policy toward mainland China, was
commenting on a demand by the Beijing-based Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) that Taiwan compensate the injured
mainland fishermen.</P>
      <P>The ARATS on Friday sent a note to its Taiwan counterpart, the
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), accusing Taiwan marine police of
"unjustifiably seizing and firing on mainland fishermen, who were in
turn forced to defend themselves" and demanding Taiwan pay reasonable
compensation to the injured fishermen.</P>
      <P>In response, Sheu categorically rejected the mainland demand for
compensation because, he said, the Taiwan marine police were
performing their public duty when they intercepted the mainland
vessel fishing illegally in Taiwan's territorial waters on Oct. 12.</P>
      <P>Sheu further said that Chuang Chen-yao, a marine police officer
who was abducted to the mainland during the incident, was defending
his own physical safety when he opened fire at the armed mainland
fishermen. "Against this background, how can we compensate the
mainland fishermen?" Sheu asked.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Sheu said, Taiwan would be willing to study the
feasibility of offering some "consolation money" to the mainland
fishermen who were allegedly injured in the incident, with a view to
maintaining harmonious relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Sheu also urged mainland authorities to send Chuang back to
Taiwan as soon as possible to avoid complicating the incident.</P>
      <P>He said the MAC has authorized the SEF to discuss the issue with
ARATS. "We hope a satisfactory solution will be worked out in the
near future," he added.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are semi-official intermediary bodies founded
by their respective government to handle cross-strait exchanges
in the absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>The ARATS said in its latest note to the SEF that Chuang has
basically recovered following medical care in Fujian province in
southeastern China.</P>
      <P>The ARATS hinted that mainland authorities would allow Chuang to
return to Taiwan if Chuang "compensates for the Fujian fishermen's
medical expenses and economic losses."</P>
      <P>It further said details related to compensation will be
finalized by personnel from the Fujian and Taiwan Red Cross
organizations or other non-governmental bodies, adding the Fujian
Red Cross Society will arrange for Chuang's return to Taiwan at the
earliest possible date.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China's President Jiang Zemin
begins his "most important foreign venture" on Sunday, eager to
please and desperate to be liked in the United States, a major
Canadian newspaper reported on Friday.</P>
      <P>The Globe and Mail said the paunchy leader has been boning up on
his stilted English, asking aides to prepare a few good jokes and
telling US reporters what an ordinary guy he is.</P>
      <P>The 71-year-old Jiang has agreed to an itinerary that goes to the
symbolic heartland of the US, including the sunken battleship Arizona
in Pearl Harbor, colonial Williamsburg, Independence Hall in
Philadelphia and the New York Stock Exchange. He will even deliver a
speech to students at Harvard University, complete with questions
from the floor, the daily said in a dispatch from Beijing.</P>
      <P>"This is all about image-building," the daily quoted a Western
diplomat in Beijing as saying. "He wants to try to change American
perceptions of China, to demystify himself and his country a little
bit," the diplomat was quoted as adding.</P>
      <P>"It's symbol over substance, but that doesn't mean it's
unimportant," the report quoted another observer as saying.</P>
      <P>It pointed out that 25 years after Richard Nixon's historic visit
to mainland China, the two countries are still struggling to
understand each other. As recently as 18 months ago, their relations
were at an all-time low after a bitter wrangle over the granting of a
US visa to Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui and the dispatching of two
US aircraft carriers near Taiwan during a series of Chinese missile
tests near the island, it noted.</P>
      <P>Since then, both have worked hard to heal the wounds. The daily
quoted Dave Lambton of the National Committee on US-China Relations
as saying: "I think both sides were extremely alarmed at how the
whole Taiwan situation could run out of control.</P>
      <P>"Particularly in Washington and among many in Congress, they came
to the conclusion that US-China relations are not just about trade,
and not just about human rights. They're about war and peace. If
there is no common understanding about our objectives in the world,
we could end up in a military conflict."</P>
      <P>More important than setting up a hotline between Jiang and
Clinton is "communicating in some way with the broader public... to
change America's mind about what is this place, China," Lambton was
quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>This may be difficult, despite Jiang's desire to do so, said the
Mail's Beijing correspondent, Rod Mickleburgh. The goodwill and
curiosity from Deng Xiaoping's 1979 visit are long gone and Jiang is
likely to meet with frequent public protests and an official reserve
befitting the politics of welcoming someone who presides over a
country that continues to jail its dissidents and justify the
massacre of hundreds of unarmed civilians in 1989, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING DENOUNCED FOR ATTEMPTING TO LURE AWAY ROC ALLY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 25 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday
denounced mainland China for attempting to use its leverage in the
United Nations to lure away one of the Republic of China's diplomatic
allies, the Central African Republic.</P>
      <P>The ministry said in news release that Qin Huasun, mainland
China's permanent representative to the United Nations, had intended
to drive a wedge between the ROC and the Central African Republic
when he visited the latter earlier this week to inspect the
operations of UN peacekeeping forces there.</P>
      <P>Qin visited the Central African Republic Oct. 21-23 in his
capacity as reigning chairman of the UN Security Council for
November. The visit was mainly aimed at reviewing current UN
peacekeeping force operations as a reference for deciding whether the
mission will be continued after its three-month term expires at the
end of this month.</P>
      <P>However, the ministry said, Qin deliberately included in his
five-member delegation officials from mainland China's Ministry of
Foreign Affairs, such as the deputy director of the ministry's
African Affairs Department and the translation division chief.</P>
      <P>"The move has not only confused the government of the Central
African Republic but also 'spotlighted' Qin's attempt to take
advantage of his UN position to sabotage our relationship with
Bangui," the press statement said.</P>
      <P>It further said the ministry has ordered the ROC Embassy in the
Central African Republic to closely monitor developments in that
country and remind its government that its contact with mainland
China should not undermine its relations with the ROC.</P>
      <P>The ministry said the ROC Embassy had expressed its grave concern
over Qin's activities in the Central African Republic. In addition to
urging that country to take note of mainland China's plot to sabotage
its ties with the ROC, the embassy also reaffirmed the ROC's firm
commitment to continuing various bilateral cooperative projects and
assisting Bangui in rebuilding its battered economy following three
mutinies last year.</P>
      <P>During his visit, Qin had met with the Central African Republic's
senior leaders, including its president, prime minister, minister of
foreign affairs and the speaker of its parliament, in addition to
inspecting several UN peacekeeping force bases. Qin also managed to
deliver a speech to that country's parliament, soliciting
parliamentary support for resumption of diplomatic ties between
Beijing and Bangui.</P>
      <P>The Central African Republic first established diplomatic
relations with the ROC in 1962, but switched its diplomatic
recognition to mainland China in 1964. It cut links with mainland
China in 1966, and resumed official ties with the ROC in 1968. In
1976, it again switched its diplomatic allegiance to Beijing. The
country resumed full-fledged diplomatic ties with the ROC on July 8,
1991 and on the same day, Beijing cut off its links with Bangui.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign exchange deposits in Taiwan banks
totaled NT$424.6 billion (US$14.88 billion) at the end of September,
which is a record high, according to statistics compiled by the
Central Bank of China.</P>

    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct.  25  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Asian crime syndicates are bringing a
flood of illegal immigrants from mainland China and other places in
Asia into Australia, experts said at a recent meeting in Sydney.</P>
      <P>Police officials said at the meeting of the Australian Academy of
Forensic Sciences that Asian crime syndicates are bringing "ready
reserves of criminal labor" into Australia to conduct extortion,
prostitution and drug smuggling.</P>
      <P>Dr. Richard Basham, a renowned expert on Asian crime, told the
gathering of senior police and forensic experts that immigrants,
particularly from mainland China, were being forced into crime in
"near slavery" conditions to repay debts to criminal groups for
entering Australia.</P>
      <P>Basham said the illegal immigrants were forced to repay more than
A$15,000 (US$10,500) to those who brought them to Australia.</P>
      <P>"Failure to repay such debts will invoke serious sanctions,
including murder," he said.</P>
      <P>He told the meeting that police should regard official documents
from Asian countries with suspicion, warning of corrupt consulate
officials who provide phony documents for illegal entry into
Australia or legitimate documents to undesirable immigrants.</P>
      <P>Basham said sophisticated schemes involved mainland Chinese
government enterprises bringing fake or real employees on temporary
visas into Australia, with these people then sometimes being forced
to pose as employees in legitimate businesses and to siphon money
into criminal accounts.</P>
      <P>Calling human smuggling a "serious threat" to Australia, he
warned that criminal syndicates could smuggle increasing numbers of
immigrants into the country unless immigration laws are substantially
tightened.</P>
      <P>Australia is seen as a "soft target" for illegal immigrants
because the success of English-language programs has allowed them to
pose as students, Basham said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Restricting the fat intake of children
could mean a loss of energy and nutrients, a leading Canadian expert
said.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a scientific conference in Perth Friday, Professor
Stan Zlotkin, a Canadian expert in pediatrics, said the key to health
is a moderated amount of all food groups.</P>
      <P>"There are a number of case reports where individuals have said
to themselves, especially parents, that if a little bit of fat
restriction was good, then a lot of fat restriction must be even
better."</P>
      <P>He said low-fat diets for children could mean a loss in energy
and nutrients that other foods can't easily compensate for.</P>
      <P>"I would like to suggest we should offer children a variety of
tasty, age-appropriate foods in moderation and that whenever possible
that appetites dictate quantity of intakes," he said.</P>
      <P>"Any message of fat restriction may give the wrong message to
certain people," he cautioned.</P>
      <P>He said concerns had been expressed about the misapplication of
the dietary message of cutting fat and that it could make things
worse for some adolescent girls already preoccupied with thinness.</P>
      <P>"I would also like to suggest that we not specifically restrict
any food or food group because it is a 'bad food' -- because there
really is no such thing," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEE  KUAN  YEW  EXPECTS  REGION'S  RECOVERY  IN TWO TO THREE YEARS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore, Oct. 25 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore's Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew
predicts that Southeast Asia's economies will take two to three years
to recover from the current financial turmoil.</P>
      <P>But how fast they get back on track depends on whether
governments have the political will to "do the unpleasant quickly and
thoroughly," as the root causes of the crisis are political factors,
he pointed out in a keynote address to top businessmen at a Fortune
500 Forum in the US city of Boston on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lee said that Southeast Asia's economies are now closely
integrated into the world's financial markets and subject to their
harsh discipline.</P>
      <P>Governments will have to reform their financial institutions,
enforce rigorous supervision of their banks and be disciplined in
their macro-economic policies.</P>
      <P>"Those governments that have the political strength to do the
unpleasant quickly and thoroughly will reap the best rewards," he
said.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that in nearly every economic crisis, "the root
cause is political, not economic."</P>
      <P>For example, Thailand's problems from its burgeoning current
account deficits, inflexible exchange rate regime and over-investment
in property, had long lain dormant and ignored.</P>
      <P>They were not dealt with because Thailand has had a rapid
turnover of prime ministers and cabinets in the last five years, with
none staying in office long enough to tackle the problems. In
addition, many Thai leaders in government and opposition have
personal interests in the fates of finance companies and banks and
there is "a natural reluctance to discipline them."</P>
      <P>"So warning signs were ignored and remedies postponed. When the
attack on the Thai baht came, billions of dollars were spent in
defending the baht, all to no avail. This increased the eventual
costs."</P>
      <P>The baht crisis spread to the Philippines, Malaysia and
Indonesia. Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore were also not
spared.</P>
      <P>But Singapore's currency was not attacked as badly, he noted,
because fund managers knew it had annual budget and current account
surpluses, zero foreign debt, strong reserves of over US$80 billion
(S$127 billion) and banks with the highest credit rating in Asia.</P>
      <P>The countries that have been hit could overcome their setbacks
"within two to three years" if their governments tackle the basic
weaknesses, he said.</P>
      <P>Basic conditions for rapid growth remain, such as high savings,
pro-growth and pro-business governments and hardworking people. Also,
weaker currencies will boost exports.</P>
      <P>"The lesson they have learned and cannot afford to forget is that
savings and borrowings must be channeled into productive
investments," Lee said.</P>
      <P>The currency crisis will also force most, if not all the
countries in the region to liberalize and become more
market-oriented, he predicted, citing Indonesia's deregulation and
Thailand's impending financial reforms worked out with the
International Monetary Fund as examples.</P>
      <P>In his 30-minute speech and in the 10-minute dialogue that
followed, Lee also made a strong pitch for the United States to
strengthen its economic links with ASEAN (Association of Southeast
Asian Nations) and gave his reading of the situation in mainland
China, Japan and North Korea.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEE  KUAN  YEW  CALLS  FOR  ASEAN-US  FREE-TRADE  PACTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore, Oct. 25 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore's Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew
has called on the United States to consider forging free-trade
agreements (FTAs) with Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
countries, saying they would benefit both sides economically and
ensure continued US engagement in the region.</P>
      <P>"FTAs will provide a framework that can ensure that economic
links between the US and Southeast Asia remain deep and broad and so
make it worthwhile for the US to stay engaged in the region," he
said.</P>
      <P>Lee made the call in a speech to 150 top business leaders at a
Fortune 500 Forum in Boston.</P>
      <P>Highlighting the advantages of such FTAs, he said they could help
the US maintain its predominant economic and technological position
in the world, especially vis-a-vis mainland China.</P>
      <P>It will help US firms tap into the important ASEAN market, and
the market will be able to absorb the higher-technology goods from
the US as it develops further, he said.</P>
      <P>ASEAN countries face stiff competition from mainland China,
because it has lower labor costs, he said.</P>
      <P>FTAs would reduce the comparative advantage which mainland China
enjoys from lower costs.</P>
      <P>"A stronger US-ASEAN linkage will bring economic benefits to both
sides and also ensure that there will be no major East-West divide
down the Pacific Ocean," he added.</P>
      <P>Although he noted that FTAs are not popular with American unions
or politicians, he said: "As captains of industry, I hope you will
persuade your Congressmen that this goal of extending your influence
into the future through FTAs is one worth achieving."</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOH EXPECTS ASIAN CURRENCIES TO STABILIZE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Oct.  26 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong
said he does not foresee another round of speculative attacks on
Asian currencies, and that stabilization should follow after the
shock on Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index last week.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong appears to be the last post under siege by currency and
share speculation in the region, he told the British Broadcasting
Corporation in a television interview aired on Friday, The Straits
Times reported Sunday in a dispatch from Edinburgh.</P>
      <P>Before the crisis, he pointed out, there had been a need to
adjust regional currency values, and stock markets were at an
all-time high some months ago. But the sentiment now is too negative.
"My sense is that it is over-corrected," he was quoted as commenting.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan's economy and the South Korean currency had
also taken a beating, Goh was quoted as saying: "So after Hong Kong,
where do you go? Another round?</P>
      <P>I don't see the possibility of another round because currencies
have gone down, in my view, by too much already in value. So I would
expect that after Hong Kong, we should see some stabilizing factors
in play."</P>
      <P>As to when recovery could be expected, Goh said a lot will depend
on the package of measures Indonesia plans to implement in
negotiation with the International Monetary Fund, supplemented by
help from Singapore.</P>
      <P>This, backed by strong political will from Jakarta, should see
confidence rebound and a positive ripple effect in the region, he
said.</P>
      <P>In today's world, it is not possible even for sound economies
like Singapore to escape completely unscathed from such crises, he
noted, simply because the global economy is now very interdependent.</P>
      <P>On whether Singapore could withstand the pressure of the present
situation, he said the country could carry on for some time, as its
fundamentals are sound, there is no overseas debt and surpluses are
good.</P>
      <P>"We will just have to sit out this turmoil in the region, and
hopefully play our part to restore confidence in the region," he was
quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>However, he noted that after the value of Asian currencies
settles down, exports from Asia will become cheaper compared to those
from the West.</P>
      <P>"I think we're going to see, maybe after some time, a surge of
exports from Asia to Europe, to America. Would the currency
speculators then focus on the West and say their currencies are
over-valued against the currencies in the East? I think we have to
watch out for that volatile movement from East to West, West to
East."</P>
      <P>Goh said he expected currency volatility to be a topic of "robust
discussion" at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in
Edinburgh, which went into its second day of closed-door executive
discussions on Saturday.</P>
      <P>The four-day meeting, he noted, should see consensus on key areas
such as getting Commonwealth economies to open a debate on the need
to keep the international trading regime open, and to consider having
a new round of trade negotiations under the World Trade Organization
sometime early in the next century.</P>
      <P>The Commonwealth, he added, should also help its 54 member
nations integrate themselves into the world economy and keep up with
changes, especially in information technology.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ASIAN CRIME SYNDICATES BRINGING CRIMINAL LABORERS TO AUSTRALIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct.  25  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Asian crime syndicates are bringing a
flood of illegal immigrants from mainland China and other Asian
countries into Australia with the aid of corrupt officials here and
sham English language courses, according to Australian police.</P>
      <P>The police said Asian crime syndicates are bringing "ready
reserves of criminal labor" into Australia to conduct extortion,
prostitution and drug smuggling, a closed meeting of senior police
and forensic experts said.</P>
      <P>Dr. Richard Basham, a renowned expert on Asian crime and a member
of New South Wales Police Commissioner Peter Ryan's advisory group,
told a recent meeting in Sydney that immigrants, particularly from
mainland China, were forced into crime, such as prostitution in "near
slavery" conditions, to repay debts to criminal groups for entering
Australia.</P>
      <P>Basham said mainland Chinese immigrants were forced to repay more
than A$15,000 to criminals who charged usurious interest rates.</P>
      <P>"Failure to repay such debts will invoke serious sanctions,
including murder," he said.</P>
      <P>He told the meeting of the Australian Academy of Forensic
Sciences in Sydney that police should treat all official documents
from Asian countries with extreme caution when exchanging information
with their Asian counterparts.</P>
      <P>Basham warned of corrupt consulate officials in Asian countries
who provide phony documents for illegal entry into Australia as well
as legitimate documents to undesirable immigrants.</P>
      <P>He said some sophisticated schemes involved mainland Chinese
government enterprises bringing fake or real employees on temporary
visas into Australia.</P>
      <P>He said these employees were sometimes forced to pose as
employees in legitimate businesses, siphoning money into criminal
accounts.</P>
      <P>He warned that Chinese triads and other criminal syndicates could
increasingly smuggle immigrants into Australia unless immigration
laws were substantially tightened.</P>
      <P>"Human smuggling ... representing a serious threat to Australia
under false names and pretenses provides a ready reservoir of
criminal labor and they are unlikely ever to cooperate fully with
police, taxation and other authorities," Basham said.</P>
      <P>He said Australia was already seen as a "soft target" for illegal
immigrants because of the success of English-language programs that
allowed illegal immigrants to pose as students, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HONG KONG TYCOONS MAY BE HARDEST HIT BY STOCK SLUMP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore, Oct. 26 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Hong Kong's spectacular stock plunge has
wiped billion of dollars off the bourse with the territory's
well-known tycoons seeing a massive amount of their wealth disappear
in a matter of days.</P>
      <P>The top three Hong Kong families may have lost a combined HK$52
billion in the value of their holdings in their flagship companies
within the last one week, the Singapore Business Times reported on
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Well-known tycoon Li Ka-shing may well turn out to be the biggest
individual loser, with the net worth of his stock-holdings at Cheung
Kong Holdings now down by about HK$16 billion, the report said.</P>
      <P>Li, known popularly as "Superman" in the territory, controls
about 771 million shares at Cheung Kong, which, at the closing price
of HK$76.10 on Oct. 17, were valued at HK$58.7 billion.</P>
      <P>But the stock plunge trimmed the price to HK$55 Saturday,
reducing his net worth to HK$42.4 billion.</P>
      <P>In percentage terms, Li's losses were also the biggest among the
top tycoons in Hong Kong, the report said. But Cheung Kong is just
one of Li's many companies, it added.</P>
      <P>The popular billionaire remained cautiously optimistic on
Thursday, saying: "Rising interest rates will undeniably cause market
turbulence in the property market. We are likely to see a small
consolidation in property prices."</P>
      <P>Walter Kwok and his family, which controls Hong Kong's biggest
property group Sun Hung Kai Properties, saw their holdings in the
company reduced by HK$21 billion within a week, down to HK$68 billion
from HK$89 billion.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lee Shau-kee, who until last week was arguably Asia's
richest man, may no longer own that distinction, the report said.</P>
      <P>His holdings at flagship Henderson Land was down HK$14.24 billion
to HK$49 billion from HK$63 billion.</P>
      <P>It was reported that Lee's position as the ninth richest man in
the world -- based on a ranking by Forbes in July -- may have slipped
to 35th.</P>
      <P>The chairman of Henderson Land saw his wealth halved in less than
four months, the report said.</P>
      <P>Macau gambling tycoon Stanley Ho lost about HK$76.6 million in
Shun Tak Holdings, it said.</P>

      <P>The United States is open to mainland
China's membership in the World Trade Organization (WTO), but is
unwilling to make concessions for a deal at next week's
Beijing-Washington summit, according to reports from the world trade

Beijing over several months, however, progress has been very slow.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN URGED TO ERADICATE ILLEGAL FISHING BOATS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Oct.  26  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Deep-Sea Tuna Fishing
Industry Association on Sunday urged relevant government authorities
to crack down on illegal fishing boats in order to avoid potential
international fishery disputes.</P>
      <P>The association made the call after an international meeting on
tuna fishing and related issues held here, which was attended by more
than 100 representatives from Taiwan, Japan and South Korea.</P>
      <P>As a result of an international ban on drift-net fishing and the
increased enforcement of exclusive 200-nautical-mile economic zones
within the international community, the association said more Taiwan
operators are using illegal fishing vessels to poach in territorial
waters of foreign countries. Their actions have aroused strong
protests both from legal operators and from other countries.</P>
      <P>It said that there are currently about 160 illegal fishing
vessels worldwide, nearly double the figure of around 83 a decade
ago, with around 10 percent of the overall number owned by operators
from Taiwan, Japan and South Korea.</P>
      <P>According to the association, the illegal fishing ships are
mainly aging vessels which are either unregistered or which fly the
flags of countries that do not strictly enforce pertinent
regulations.</P>
      <P>As those illegal fishing boats are poaching without restriction
by either national laws or international practices, their operations
have seriously depleted international fishery stocks and have lowered
international market prices, the association pointed out.</P>
      <P>It said that as a result, Japan, which is Taiwan's major export
market for tuna, has strongly protested, asking authorities here to
take concerted efforts to stem such illegal operations.</P>
      <P>While urging the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture and the
provincial-level Taiwan Fisheries Bureau to quickly respond, the
association also called on the local fishing sector to exercise
self-restraint so as to protect both its own interests and the image
of Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NT DOLLAR DEPRECIATION MIXED BLESSING FOR LOCAL INDUSTRIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 27 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>High technology and traditional industries
have fared differently in the latest round of NT dollar depreciation,
officials of the China External Trade Development Council (CETRA)
said Monday.</P>
      <P>The exchange rate of the NT dollar against the US dollar hovered
around NT$28.5 in mid-October, but has since dropped, reaching
NT$30.49 to US$1 in mid-day session on Taiwan exchange market
Monday, after the Central Bank of China adopted a hands-off attitude
and allowed the local currency to float on exchange markets.</P>
      <P>The officials said that the information and semi-conductor
industries have benefited from a devalued NT dollar, adding that
manufacturers in those sectors have their hands full processing
orders from the United States.</P>
      <P>In contrast, more traditional industries such as textiles have
suffered because the degree of the NT dollar's depreciation has been
less than that of currencies in the Southeast Asian nations, making
it more difficult for textile products to gain inroads into that
region. In the traditional export market of the United States,
exporters also face stiffer competition from Southeast Asia.</P>
      <P>The local machinery industry has seen little progress so far this
year in attempts to boost exports to Germany and Southeast Asian
markets, the officials said. They added that the effect of the NT
dollar's depreciation on that sector will not be known until sometime
next year.</P>
      <P>The officials said the biggest beneficiary of the recent currency
depreciation will be Taiwan businessmen with investments in the
electric, electronics and information industries in Southeast Asia.
They had previously received orders in Taiwan, with prices quoted in
terms of a stronger NT dollar, and are currently delivering goods
from their plants in the Southeast Asian nations.</P>
      <P>With global demands for personal computers expanding, Taiwan, on
the strength of its technological edge over the Southeast Asian
nations and the advantage of a devalued local currency, can look
forward to expanding its exports to Europe and the United States,
they said.</P>
      <P>But manufacturers in the textile industry, while losing orders to
Southeast Asian nations whose currencies have dropped between 30
percent and 60 percent in value over recent months, have suffered a
double-edged blow as textile imports into Taiwan from Indonesia and
Malaysia have also increased.</P>

    <HEADLINE>1ST ASIAN CORD BLOOD BANK TO BE SET UP IN TAIPEI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 27 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will set up an umbilical cord blood
bank early next year to benefit patients suffering from leukemia and
other blood ailments, the non-profit Chinese Blood Services
Foundation said on Monday.</P>
      <P>"We have purchased all needed equipment and will start to collect
cord blood late this year or early next year," said Chang Ying-erh,
chief executive of the foundation. "If all goes well, the
long-planned cord blood bank, the first of its kind in Asia, will
become operational by the end of next January."</P>
      <P>In the initial stage, Chang said, the foundation will cooperate
with National Taiwan University Hospital and Taipei Municipal
Hospital for Women and Children to solicit the consent of would-be
mothers to donate their placenta.</P>
      <P>"With their consent, we'll extract umbilical cord blood right
after they give birth," Chang said, adding that the extracted cord
blood will be specially treated and then stored in ultra-low
temperature liquefied nitrogen. "In this way, the cord blood can
remain usable for more than 10 years."</P>
      <P>Cheng Jen-wei, a member of the foundation's research department
staff, said umbilical cord blood contains rich blood-making cells,
which can be transplanted to help treat many malignant diseases.
Medical doctors have traditionally relied primarily on transplants of
bone marrow stem cells. Such surgical procedures, however, are often
hindered by difficulties in finding donors with matching bone marrow
and by technical complications in obtaining donor organs.</P>
      <P>After years of study, Cheng said, scientists have discovered that
umbilical cord blood, which has traditionally been discarded, contains
rich blood-making stem cells.</P>
      <P>"The collection of umbilical cord blood is like waste recycling
and will not cause any negative effects on donors' health," Cheng
said, adding that the probability of rejection in cord blood
transplants is even lower than that for bone marrow transplant, with
a success rate exceeding 70 percent.</P>
      <P>The world's first umbilical cord blood transplant was performed
on a five-year-old "Fanconi anaemia" patient in the United States in
1988. The operation was successful. Since then at least 22 cord blood
transplant medical teams have been established around the world. The
United States and many European countries have set up umbilical cord
blood banks.</P>
      <P>According to domestic medical records, National Taiwan University
Hospital completed the island's first umbilical cord blood transplant
operation in 1995. Though the operation was successful, the young
patient died 146 days after the transplant because of a relapse of
leukemia.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI MAYOR SUED BY CITY COUNCILORS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  27 (CNA)
(By Debbie Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei city councilors from the New Party
on Monday filed a suit against Mayor Chen Shui-bian for allegedly
endangering public safety.</P>
      <P>New Party Councilors Fei Hung-tai, Chin Li-fang and Chiang Li-an
filed civil complaints of assault and battery on behalf of the
families of three men who were critically injured during a massive
tug-of-war held Saturday afternoon at the Keelung River Park.</P>
      <P>Forty-two others, including the ambassadors from three of the
ROC's diplomatic allies, sustained minor injuries to their hands or
arms when the rope being used in the contest broke, sending the
participants tumbling to the ground. The event was organized by the
Taipei City Government to mark Taiwan's Retrocession Day.</P>
      <P>Officials from the Taipei District Court, however, indicated that
the city councilors cannot legitimately file the suit, saying the
court can only hear the case if it is filed by an injured party.
Prosecutors, meanwhile, agreed to look into whether any person or
party should bear responsibility for the accident.</P>
      <P>Mayor Chen on Monday approved the resignation of Luo Wen-chia,
head of the city government's Information Department, who offered to
step down immediately after the incident "to take responsibility for
the tragedy."</P>
      <P>Chen would not comment directly on the lawsuit, but said he is
willing to cooperate with and assist any necessary investigations
into the case.</P>
      <P>Chen Chien-chih, speaker of the Taipei City Council, authorized a
change of Monday's agenda at the council to debate the mishap, and
requested that the mayor and his aides be present for
interpellations.</P>
      <P>Describing the accident as the result of "major negligence," Chen
said the city government can hardly absolve itself of all blame for
using an inappropriate rope, for failing to take out insurance on the
contestants, and for recruiting academics, rather than sports
officials, to sponsor the event.</P>
      <P>In the mishap, two men's left arms were completely dismembered
when the rope being used for the tug-of-war snapped about one minute
after the contest began, with the sudden and powerful force unleashed
sending participants reeling, injuring a total of 45.</P>
      <P>The force of the surge was unexpectedly powerful because some
1,600 people were engaged in the tug-of-war, using a rope which could
not withstand the strain of so much tension.</P>
      <P>After marathon operations late Saturday, surgeons at Mackay
Memorial Hospital successfully reattached the two men's severed arms.
There is a possibility they will regain 60 percent to 90 percent of
the functions of those limbs after undergoing follow-up surgery in
about three months, one surgeon said.</P>
      <P>The third person critically injured in the accident, a
67-year-old man, sustained severe internal bleeding. He remained in
intensive care for observation after doctors operated on his liver
and spleen.</P>
      <P>Mayor Chen, who met Sunday with surgeons from Taipei's major
hospitals and asked them to do whatever they could to help the three
men, promised that the city government would pay compensation and all
medical bills for the injured, including costs for plastic surgery,
special nurses and rehabilitative therapy.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The recent depreciation of the New Taiwan
dollar is expected to help boost exports of locally made notebook
computers, which have been declining since the beginning of this
year, industry sources say.</P>
      <P>The sources predicted that "exports of Taiwan-made notebook
computers will expand next year," as the depreciation of the local
currency has made Taiwan's notebook computers more competitive
against Japanese products in the international market and will drive
more Japanese computer firms to shift production back to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Compared with the same period of last year, most Taiwan computer
companies posted noticeable drops in revenues and profits in the
first three quarters of the year upon the effect of a 4 percent
depreciation of the Japanese yen against the US dollar since last
October.</P>
      <P>Tallies compiled by the Institute for the Information Industry
show that the stake enjoyed by Taiwan notebook computers in the world
marketplace has fallen to the current level of 29 percent from the
previous 34 percent share posted since late last year.</P>
      <P>However, with the local currency falling by 9 percent against the
greenback over the past year, business sources said Taiwan's notebook
computer makers will regain their competitive edge and can look
forward to expanded export markets.</P>
      <P>Experts estimate that the scale of the international notebook
computer market will continue to grow from the current 15 million
units sold annually to 26 million units by 2001, a faster rate of
increase than that forecast for the information industry as a whole.</P>
      <P>The experts also predicted that Taiwan's notebook computer
production will stabilize in the coming year, with manufacturers
reporting increased profits.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Chinese media productions,
including movies, audio recordings, radio broadcasts and TV programs
will be allowed to use Taiwan processing facilities in the future,
the cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said on Monday.</P>
      <P>But a MAC official said the finished products will have to be
shipped out of Taiwan upon completion and will still be banned from
display, broadcast or distribution in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Sheu Ke-sheng said the move is in line with a
government plan to develop Taiwan into a media center in the Asia and
Pacific region and to promote cooperation between the mass
communication industries on either side of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Under the new regulations, Taiwan businessmen who can submit
commission papers to the Government Information Office (GIO) will be
able to apply for permission to process mainland China movies, audio
recordings, TV and radio broadcast programs.</P>
      <P>Sheu said the government will also consider permitting mainland
newspapers and magazines, in addition to books, to be displayed in
Taiwan, through events such as trade fairs and exhibitions, although
their sale in this country will still be prohibited.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT LEE DEFENDS `NO HASTE, BE PATIENT' POLICY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  27  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui on Monday again
defended the government's "no haste, be patient" investment policy
toward mainland China, stressing that the policy is aimed primarily
at safeguarding Taiwan's security and ensuring its continued economic
growth.</P>
      <P>Lee made the statement while meeting with winners of this year's
Outstanding Business People Award sponsored by the General Chamber of
Commerce of the Republic of China. The winners included local
entrepreneurs, trade representatives of foreign countries and senior
executives of foreign companies stationed in Taipei.</P>
      <P>As a national leader, Lee said, he has consistently mulled issues
from an overall perspective in order to understand the "big picture"
to boost the well-being of all ROC nationals. "The policy has no
correlation with my personal likes or dislikes."</P>
      <P>The president said he has always been concerned about relations
across the Taiwan Strait. "I have repeatedly held out the olive
branch, but have yet to receive any reciprocal response of goodwill
from the mainland leadership," he said regretfully.</P>
      <P>Lee said that despite Taiwan's repeated calls for resumption of
cross-trait dialogue, which mainland China unilaterally suspended in
mid-1995, Beijing authorities are still unwilling to resume talks.</P>
      <P>"If non-political issues related to the interests of the people
on both sides of the Taiwan Strait cannot be resolved, how can we
conduct political talks with the mainland?" Lee asked.</P>
      <P>Turning to the "three links" issue, Lee said the topic has seen
frequent debate over the past few years. "Speaking responsibly, I
have to say that the time is not yet ripe for the opening of direct
cross-strait trade, communications and transport links," he asserted.</P>
      <P>Lee further pointed out that uncertainty reigns in relations with
mainland China because it is a despotic, totalitarian regime and
lacks a clearly defined policymaking system.</P>
      <P>"Against this backdrop, we should remain cautious and prudent in
dealing with the `three links' issue, because at stake is our
national security, social stability and the well-being of our
people," the president explained.</P>
      <P>Lee went on to say that Taiwan's economic prosperity is no
windfall bonanza but the outcome of the concerted efforts of all the
country's people over the past five decades. "We must therefore be
very cautious in forging ties with mainland China in order to protect
these hard-won achievements."</P>
      <P>Commenting on recent appeals by several local business
heavyweights for early opening of direct cross-strait links and the
further liberalization of investment in mainland China, Lee said
those business people may be pursuing their own agendas and putting
their personal business interests first. "But it is crystal clear
which should take precedence when personal or corporate interests
conflict with the overall national interest," he said.</P>
      <P>Touching on Taiwan's economic future, Lee said he is optimistic
about the country's economic prospects. "Our people's diligence and
devoted efforts, plus a sound economic policy, have enabled us to
exploit our limited resources to the maximum extent over the past
decades," he noted, adding that the island's economy will continue to
grow steadily, with this year's growth rate expected to reach 6.5
percent.</P>

      <P>The ROC government will closely monitor
developments in the upcoming summit between US president Bill Clinton
and his mainland China counterpart Jiang Zemin on Oct. 29, said Sheu
Ke-sheng, vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), on
Monday.</P>
      <P>Jiang and Clinton are expected to confer on the establishment of
a new stage in their bilateral relationship, as well as covering
topics such as trade, arms proliferation and human rights.</P>
      <P>Sheu pointed out during a news conference that the Foreign
Ministry will assert Taipei's stance whenever necessary and
reiterated that he doesn't think the summit will proceed at the
expense of the US relationship with Taiwan. The MAC will react in a
timely manner to developments at the summit which touch on the
sensitive cross-Taiwan Strait issue, Sheu added.</P>
      <P>He declined to comment on a report that the government has
established an ad hoc committee to monitor the summit, saying only
that the Foreign Ministry, the MAC and other relevant organizations
will scrutinize the meeting closely.</P>
      <P>Sheu reasserted the MAC's standpoint that it is good to see
engagement between Washington and Beijing, adding that Taipei
approves of Jiang's US visit, since benign interaction between the US
and mainland China is helpful to the stability and prosperity both of

    <HEADLINE>MOEA MAPS OUT STRATEGIES TO RAISE TAIWAN'S COMPETITIVENESS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 27 (CNA)
(By Debbie Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Economic Affairs Minister Wang Chih-kang on
Monday spelled out a six-point strategy to help raise Taiwan's
international competitiveness.</P>
      <P>During a keynote speech at a seminar studying ways to bolster
industrial and commercial development, Wang said the Ministry of
Economic Affairs (MOEA) has decided to take a six-point approach to
sharpening Taiwan's competitive edge in the international market.</P>
      <P>The strategy includes the following angles: creating investment
niches for potential investors; developing scientific technology
industries; beefing up small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs);
bolstering export competence; strengthening infrastructure; and
expanding international cooperation, he noted.</P>
      <P>Wang said newly established investment projects expected to
become operational this year amount to NT$281.6 billion (US$9.39
billion), up 33.3 percent over the year-earlier level. The domestic
investment climate will be further improved after an investment
coordination center and a "single-desk" service station under the
MOEA are completed.</P>
      <P>To enhance sci-tech development, Wang said the MOEA will see to
it that 10-20 percent of the R&amp;D funds to which state-run enterprises
are entitled will be allocated annually to sci-tech development and
related industries.</P>
      <P>The ministry will also further relax regulations on
over-the-counter applications by sci-tech companies and will spend
some NT$200 million (US$6.66 million) in fiscal 1998 to foster the
development of more sci-tech talent, he added.</P>
      <P>To beef up the development of SMEs, Wang said his ministry will
help proprietors by allowing easier access to funds on easier terms,
providing access to industrial land and implementing a computerized
service network providing the latest market information.</P>
      <P>The MOEA already has a map outlining a 30-market exploration plan
to expand Taiwan's exports to the United States, Japan, Europe and
Southeast Asia. The ministry has also worked out a NT$150 million
(US$5 million) program to open up new outlets for Taiwan exporters in
India, Pakistan, Australia and New Zealand, Wang noted.</P>
      <P>On the infrastructure front, Wang said, the ministry will make
more industrial land available, strengthen the development of water
resources and accelerate energy supplies, which includes liberalizing
the production and distribution of oil products and privately run
power plants.</P>
      <P>To expand international cooperation, the ministry will continue
to push for Taiwan's bid to join the World Trade Organization and
will seek to establish regular, high-level official communication
channels with 17 countries, including Germany, Belgium, Austria and
Singapore, he said.</P>

      <P>The rate of fall of the Taiwan stock market
has been deemed relatively small-scale in comparison with that of the
US, Hong Kong and Japan recently, but the Finance Ministry will
closely monitor further changes during the Washington-Beijing summit

      <P>Commenting on suggestions from certain quarters concerning ways

trading (buying and selling shares on the same day), or decreasing
the upper and lower limit on the rise and fall of shares on the
Taiwan stock market's weighted index -- the share market's key
barometer -- Wu said that although the time is not yet ripe for
evaluating the feasibility of the suggestions, the Finance Ministry
will take them into consideration.</P>

have an impact on Taiwan's stock market, including economic and

    <TEXT>
      <P>Visiting President of the Republic of Chad,
Idriss Deby, was welcomed on Monday with full military honors,
complete with a 21-gun salute, at a ceremony presided over by
President Lee Teng-hui at the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall complex
in downtown Taipei.</P>
      <P>Deby, accompanied by a 16-member entourage, arrived in Taipei for
the first time on Sunday for a five-day state visit.</P>
      <P>In an address at the welcoming ceremony, Lee lauded Deby as an
outstanding leader who has managed to lead his country to achieve
great progress in political reforms and economic development in a
short period of time.</P>
      <P>Lee said the ROC government and people welcome Deby's visit and
hope it will help the Chad leader better understand Taiwan's latest
developments and thus contribute to the expansion of bilateral
cooperation in various fields.</P>
      <P>Responding to Lee's address, Deby said he is delighted to make an
official visit to the beautiful island of Taiwan. In addition to
conveying his country's respect and friendship to the Republic of
China, Deby said, he and his entourage hope to draw inspiration from
Taiwan's experience in economic development during their visit, which
is also expected to serve as a bridge and catalyst for closer
bilateral cooperation.</P>
      <P>The Chad president pointed out that many people in his country
still remember the competence and down-to-earth working style of ROC
agricultural experts stationed in Chad in the 1960s and are grateful
for their legacy.</P>
      <P>Deby further said he is convinced that there is ample room for
the two countries to cooperate now that they have resumed full
diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>The ROC and Chad restored official ties on Aug. 12, 1997 after a
25-year hiatus.</P>
      <P>While here, Deby will exchange views with Lee on the
international situation and other matters of mutual concern. He will
also visit some cultural landmarks, as well economic and trade

    <HEADLINE>ROC-AUSTRALIAN TIES RECOVERING (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra, Oct. 27 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Unofficial relations between the Republic
of China and Australia are recovering gradually and steadily as a
result of improving ties between Canberra and Beijing, according to a
survey by the CNA.</P>
      <P>In an interview, Gary Klintworth, a China expert at the
Australian National University in Canberra, said relations between
Taiwan and Australia are showing signs of gradual recovery following
a disruption between late 1996 and early 1997 because Canberra wanted
to restore its strained ties with Beijing.</P>
      <P>The strained ties were caused by a wave of incidents in 1996,
namely Australia's support of the US sending aircraft carriers to the
waters near Taiwan in March, Canberra's allowing the Dalai Lama to
visit Australia, sending a senior minister to Taipei and renewing a
military pact with the US</P>
      <P>Good relations between Taipei and Canberra were disrupted because
Australia refused to grant a visa to Yang Shieh-chien, a high-level
ROC official, in late 1996 when he was invited to give a keynote
speech at an annual Australia-Taiwan Business Council meeting.</P>
      <P>Finance Minister Paul Chiu was also refused a visa to visit
Australia in late 1996.</P>
      <P>But these refusals did not sour ties between Taiwan and Australia
until Canberra refused another visa,. this time to Vice Minister Ming
Chen-kuo of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, in early 1997.</P>
      <P>China experts said Canberra deliberately denied visas to these
senior Taiwan officials in order to pave the way for the first visit
of Premier John Howard to Beijing in late March.</P>
      <P>They said Australia was worried that the visits of Taiwan
officials could provide excuses for mainland China to criticize the
sincerity of Canberra's efforts to mend ties with Beijing.</P>
      <P>They said Australia values ties with both mainland China and
Taiwan, but Canberra gives its priority to Beijing because of the
size of the mainland market and its political muscle.</P>
      <P>Under the one-China policy, Taiwan comes second, although
Australia values the Taiwan market, the experts said. That's the
reality and it's very hard for Taipei to make any breakthrough in its
current ties.</P>
      <P>Official relations between Taiwan and Australia are beyond reach
for the foreseeable future, the experts predicted.</P>
      <P>Two-way trade between mainland China and Australia totaled about
A$8 billion in 1996 and it is expected the figure will increase in
the next few years.</P>
      <P>Trade volume between Taiwan and Australia was almost A$6 billion
during the same period and it is also expected to grow steadily in
the years to come, the experts said.</P>
      <P>Howard went to Beijing in March, and other senior Australian
officials, including Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer and Foreign
Minister Alexander Downer, have also visited mainland China in the
past few months to successfully mend ties.</P>
      <P>Klintworth and Greg Austin, of the Asian Studies department at
the Australian National University, believe bilateral ties between
Australia and mainland China have now returned to normal.</P>
      <P>They said the improved relations between Canberra and Beijing
will also help gradually restore the disrupted ties between Taiwan
and Australia.</P>
      <P>Last month, Australia sent Energy and Resources Minister Warwick
Parer to attend the annual Taiwan-Australia Business Council meeting
in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The experts said that on the surface, it seemed Canberra was
downgrading its ties with Taipei by sending a junior minister and not
a cabinet minister such as Primary Industries Minister John Anderson,
who went to Taiwan in 1996.</P>
      <P>But in substance, Parer is closer to Howard than some other
senior ministers in Australia.</P>
      <P>"We don't think our ties with Australia have downgraded just
because Canberra sent Warwick Parer," said Wang Kuo-jan, acting
representative of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in
Canberra.

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIAN STOCK MARKET REBOUND HINGES ON US RECOVERY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct.  27  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The recovery of the Australian stock
market will hinge on a recovery on Wall Street this week, Australian
economists and analysts predicted.</P>
      <P>The Australian stock market lost nearly 122 points last Thursday
and Friday, wiping off about A$19 billion in its market
capitalization in just two days because of fallout from the US, Hong
Kong and other major Asian bourses, they said.</P>
      <P>The analysts predicted the loss will affect Australia's biggest
floating of government-owned telecommunications firm -- Telstra --
and reduce Australia's government proceeds from the flotation,
estimated at up to A$14 billion in a historic privatization program.</P>
      <P>Since reaching a record high of 2779.2 on Oct. 1, the All
Ordinaries Index dropped 7.8 percent last week alone.</P>
      <P>Analysts attributed part of the decline to the size of the falls
in Northern Hemisphere markets, which averaged three percent.</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong bourse rebounded last Friday following massive
support in the form of buying from mainland China, rising 6.9 percent
to close at 11,144.34.</P>
      <P>The analysts believe the Wall Street bourse could also rebound
this week, adding some impetus to the Australian market.</P>
      <P>Economists pointed out that another major factor for a possible
recovery in the Australian stock market is that the country's
economic fundamentals remain good.</P>
      <P>"Short-term prospects of the Australian stock market are gloomy,
but the long-term outlook is bright," one said.</P>

gradually. Cultural and educational ties will also increase steadily,
he said, pointing out that although the number of students and
tourists from Taiwan is declining as a result of racial debate
sparked by Independent Member of Parliament Pauline Hanson, he
believes these ties will return to normal, especially if Australia
continues to make more promotions and brush aside fears of such
racism.</P>
      <P>Some Australian politicians agreed with Wang's views, saying the
ties between Taiwan and Australia stand separate from Canberra's ties
with Beijing.</P>
      <P>Bob Sercombe, Federal Member of the House of Representatives,

      <P>During the four-day meeting, the participants will exchange
experiences on private education and work out ways to increase
cooperation among PAPE member-countries to promote the development of
private education in the Pan-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Papers and reports to be presented during the meeting will
include: "Do Gifted and Talented Approaches Work for the
Disadvantaged" by Dr. Henry M. Levin of the United States;
"Anytime/Anyplace Learning Increases Opportunities for Lifelong
Education and Training" by Dr. Richard H. Lytle of the US; "Resume of

safe "green light" in September, indicating that the domestic
economy is on the track of steady growth, the Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD) reported on Monday.</P>
      <P>It was the 11th straight month that the country's overall
economic performance has received a "green" rating on the
CEPD-designed five-color scale for stable growth.</P>
      <P>The composite index of economic performance received a score of
31 points in September, up five points from August, signaling that
the economy continues to gain momentum and is approaching a state of
"heating up," said CEPD Economic Research Department Director Thomas
Yeh.</P>
      <P>The CEPD uses a five-color rating system to emasure the
country's monthly economic performance. A red light means the
economy is overheated; a yellow-red light indicates the economy is
heating up; a green light reflects steady growth; a yellow-blue
rating signals an economic slowdown; and a blue light represents an
economic recession.</P>
      <P>Ratings are determined according to nine major economic
indicators: export value, new export orders, industrial production,
manufacturing inventories, total employment outside the agricultural
sector, money supply, stock prices, the check default rate and bank
lending to the private sector. The minumum score for a healthy
"green" rating is 23 points.</P>
      <P>During the month of September, the nine indicators showed mixed
performances. Three indicators -- export value, industrial
output and the check default rate showed marked improvement, driving
up the overall performance score. The ratings for the remaining six
indicators remained at the same levels as the previous
month.</P>
      <P>In all, September's leading indicators edged up 0.7 percent from
August to 105.1, a sign that the domestic economy will remain strong
over the next three to five months. The index of coincident
indicators also rose 1.4 percent from August to 104, a solid evidence
that September's economic performance was better than the previous
month. Both figures are based on an indicator of 100 in 1991.</P>
      <P>Yeh said the rises in export value and industrial production
indicate that the domestic economic recovery continues to pick up
steam, while the improvement in the check default rate reflects
brisk domestic business activities and better financial status of
local business people.</P>
      <P>"All these are encouraging signs that our economy is moving an
upward swing," Yeh noted, adding that the recent fluctuation in the
local foreign exchange and stock markets will only have a limited
effect on the country's economic growth and that this year's
growth rate will reach 6.5 to 6.6 percent.</P>
      <P>Yeh further said the devaluation of the New Taiwan dollar
against the US dollar will benefit exports of some Taiwan products.
"The effect will become clear in the next few months," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>S'PORE EXPERTS EXPECT NO BIG BREAKTHROUGHS AT SUMMIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Oct.  27 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China watchers in Singapore shared the
views that the Clinton-Jiang summit on Wednesday will be a
significant meeting but not one producing immediate, concrete
results.</P>
      <P>Analysts said they do not foresee any major breakthroughs in the
series of thorny problems that have plagued relations between
mainland China and the United States over the years.</P>
      <P>Academics at Singapore's East Asian Institute, the Institute of
Southeast Asian Studies and the Political Science Department of the
National University of Singapore (NUS) pointed out that most of these
problems are fundamental yet complicated issues which require more
than political will to resolve.</P>
      <P>A senior political science lecturer at the NUS said the Taiwan
issue remains the "bone of contention" between Beijing and
Washington.</P>
      <P>Most of the analysts agreed that Beijing authorities will
pressure President Clinton to make a statement that reaffirms
Washington's "one-China" policy.</P>
      <P>However, Clinton has made such statements in his past four
meetings with Jiang Zemin, so the reaffirmation at the end of this
summit should not be seen as a major breakthrough.</P>
      <P>As for the contentious issue of mainland China's entry into the
World Trade Organization, an East Asian Institute expert predicted
that any real achievement on the issue would have to wait until
Clinton's return visit to Beijing next year.</P>
      <P>Professor Wang Gung-wu, director of the East Asian Institute,
pointed out that the summit comes at a time when Sino-US relations
are fraught with many difficulties. Thus, he said, this summit
meeting is "something significant."</P>
      <P>Most of the experts here felt that though the United States and
mainland China remain divided over human rights, bilateral relations
will not be greatly affected by this.</P>
      <P>Clinton cannot afford not to talk about human rights because of
pressure at home, a scholar commented. But the Clinton administration
has come to attach less importance to human rights because they know
the US policy on mainland China cannot be dominated by one issue
alone, he added.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, despite their differences both countries are keen
to maintain peace and security and the balance of power in the
Asia-Pacific region, the experts concluded.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Although US-mainland Chinese relations
have been heading in a positive direction recently, anti-mainland
sentiment still exists among several major groups in the United
States, according to the Indonesian Observer.</P>
      <P>"The recent uproar over political contributions to the Democratic
Party has again revealed the existence of such sentiment," the
newspaper said in its editorial Monday.</P>
      <P>The editorial, titled "President Jiang's journey," pointed out
that this visit, the first by a mainland Chinese leader to the United
States in 12 years, comes at a time when relations are plagued by a
range of issues including US ties with Taiwan, a multi-billion dollar
trade imbalance and the question of human rights.</P>
      <P>"President Jiang Zemin acknowledged that there are different
views on some issues -- particularly Taiwan -- but stressed that both
countries have the responsibility to promote stability and prosperity
between them," the editorial said.</P>
      <P>"It would be too much to expect President Jiang's current visit

superpowers, but it is a great opportunity to pave the way for better

    <HEADLINE>BULGARIA'S MUSIC PIRATES UNDER FIRE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,   Oct.   27   (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The world's record companies are
considering asking the European Commission to crack down on rapidly
growing music piracy in Bulgaria, according to reports of the
Geneva-based World Trade Organization (WTO) Monday.</P>
      <P>Piracy has long been regarded as one of the principal problems
facing the international music industry. Bulgaria, which has
relatively weak copyright legislation, has emerged as one of the
world's largest sources of counterfeit compact discs.</P>
      <P>The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI),
the London-based body which represents the world's record companies,
is considering making a formal complaint to the European Commission
against Bulgaria, the WTO report said.</P>
      <P>Nic Garnett, the federation's chief executive, was quoted as
saying that the IFPI's efforts to lobby the Bulgarian authorities
have proved unsuccessful, as have its attempts to take legal action
against pirates in the country.</P>
      <P>"The response from the Bulgarian government has been totally
inadequate," he said. "Our next step may be to petition the European
Commission to bring a trade complaint against Bulgaria."</P>
      <P>The increase in Bulgarian music piracy comes amid growing concern
among record companies about escalating counterfeiting worldwide.
Sales of pirated recordings breached US$5 billion for the first time
last year, the WTO report said.</P>
      <P>Until recently, music pirates tended to concentrate on cassettes,
a declining format which is significantly less profitable for record
labels than compact discs. However, sales of counterfeit CDs have
soared in the past year, as the cost of CD production equipment has
fallen.</P>
      <P>Bulgaria has become one of the prime sources of pirate CDs, as
local manufacturers have stepped up production and exported
counterfeit products throughout Europe. The IFPI suspects more than
15 million pirated CDs are now manufactured there each year,
representing one in eight of all those sold worldwide, the WTO report
said.</P>
      <P>Following the federation's lobbying efforts, the Bulgarian police
raided several compact disc factories this summer. Yet the
anti-piracy drive faltered in July, when a court case against a
suspected pirate collapsed.</P>
      <P>By contrast, attempts to force the mainland Chinese government to
crack down on music piracy are showing signs of success. Garnett said
that after a frustrating period when little progress was made, there
had been "a considerable improvement in the situation" in recent
months, the WTO report added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JIANG'S US TRIP SEEN AS FULL OF DANGERS DUE TO TAIWAN, TIBET ISSUES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct.  27 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The upcoming summit meeting between the
presidents of mainland China and the United States -- the first of
its kind since the late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping's trip to
America about 18 years ago -- will be fraught with difficulties
thanks to the issues of Tibet and Taiwan, The Canberra Times said
Monday.</P>
      <P>In an editorial headlined "Jiang's US Trip Full of Dangers," the
daily said: "The visit of Chinese president Jiang Zemin to the United
States is filled with risk. It has the capacity to set the tone for a
relationship that will be pivotal to the security and prosperity of
the world -- as China takes its place as a new global powerhouse."</P>
      <P>The editorial continued, however, "The prospects for success are
limited, since no major initiatives are expected but its capacity for
disaster are manifest, ranging from hostile demonstrations to the
physical safety of the Chinese leader. Little wonder that
professional diplomats take such a jaundiced view of such summitry.
The game is rarely worth the candle."</P>
      <P>The daily said the Deng visit to the United States in 1979 was a
different matter because it was useful in establishing a new image of
the Beijing leadership and allaying the fears of a generation raised
on a diet of propaganda that pictured mainland China as an
expansionist threat.</P>
      <P>"However, all the progress of a decade was lost with the horror
of Tiananmen Square in 1989. The images of bloodshed and the single
man confronting the tank remain indelible in the American psyche,"
the editorial noted.</P>
      <P>"Also, since then there has been a highly visible campaign from
the Dalai Lama to highlight Chinese oppression in Tibet. This has
added force with the release of big Hollywood films on the subject,
with simplistic plots and characterization totally ignoring the
oppressive theocracy that stultified Tibetan society for centuries,"
it said.</P>
      <P>"There is a strong Taiwan lobby in the United States that is
pressing for an independent state despite the US government's
official 'One China' policy. The religious Right has taken up cudgels
against Beijing on grounds that Christianity is being repressed on
the mainland," it added.</P>
      <P>"Together these pressure groups represent a volatile mix. The
potential for a serious diplomatic incident is a matter of obvious
concern which has not been assisted by the attitude of (Clinton)
Administration spokesmen appearing to relish the prospect of Jiang
Zemin's being exposed to American 'democracy in action,'" the daily
opined.</P>
      <P>It noted that Clinton has contributed to the volatility of the
situation by the radical change in his policy settings toward
mainland China. "For nearly three years, he sought to tie the trade
relationship to human rights. The Chinese called his bluff. They also
accused him of attempting a policy of containment," it said.</P>
      <P>"If the trip can produce a friendly atmosphere and a cooperative
attitude on both sides, real progress can be expected to follow on
the knotty issues of North Korean intransigence, China's progress
into the World Trade Organization, expanded trade within the Asia
Pacific Economic Cooperation and a permanent resolution of Taiwan's
status," the editorial said.</P>
      <P>"One serious blunder on either side could place all progress in
jeopardy. The Chinese leadership set the timing and the agenda for
the trip. If it has misjudged the mood of America, the consequences
will be serious," it added.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  27  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The following are excerpts from an
editorial carried in Monday's edition of local English-language daily
The China Post.</P>
      <P>Clinton Should Encourage Glasnost in Beijing</P>
      <P>In a sense, communist Chinese leader Jiang Zemin's visit to the
United States, which started yesterday (Oct. 26), is truly
historic...</P>
      <P>President Clinton,... is right to seek cooperation instead of
confrontation with mainland China, believing that isolation of
mainland China is a policy that is "unworkable, counterproductive and
potentially dangerous."</P>
      <P>What Clinton wants to do is to encourage mainland China to make
more changes towards freedom and democracy through constructive
engagement with the United States...</P>
      <P>Clinton (is) right in his view that greater openness will speed
mainland China's economic growth, enhance its world influence and
stabilize its society.</P>
      <P>It is, therefore, important for President Clinton to urge his
communist Chinese counterpart to stop human rights abuses and to
adopt a policy that promotes glasnost.</P>
      <P>The 71-year-old Jiang, unlike the Long March veterans, is an
intellectual by communist Chinese standards who is more or less
susceptible to the Western way of thinking. President Clinton should
use his influence to let his guest know that suppressing human
rights, stifling dissent, muscle-flexing against Taiwan as a policy
is "unworkable, counterproductive and potentially dangerous."</P>
      <P>In the long run, the importance of mainland China's openness and
glasnost far surpasses such issues... as arms exports, the greenhouse
effect and the Taiwan question. Clinton knows it (better) than
anybody else and he should convince Jiang that "without the full
freedom to think, to question, to create, China will be at a distinct
disadvantage competing with fully open societies in the Information
Age, " as he said last week.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 27 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The trade between Taiwan and mainland China
rose 8.5 percent to US$15.21 billion over the first eight months of
this year, including a 2.2 percent drop to US$1.8 billion in August
due to typhoons halting customs processing for two days that month,
according to preliminary figures from the Board of Foreign Trade
(BOFT).</P>
      <P>In January-August, Taiwan exported US$12.79 billion in goods to
mainland China, accounting for 16.2 percent of the island's total
exports and representing an annual growth rate of 6.3 percent as
mainland China's booming exports increased mainland demand for
semi-finished products and components from Taiwan, said the BOFT.</P>
      <P>Taiwan imported US$2.42 billion worth of mainland goods during
the same period, or 3.3 percent of the island's total imports in
those months.</P>
      <P>That dollar figure represents an annual increase of 10.5 percent,
which the BOFT attributed to Taiwan's economic recovery entailing
increasing demands for semi-finished products and raw materials from
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Two-way trade was US$10.36 billion in Taiwan's favor, which
translates into a 3.1 percent growth, similar to the 3.8 percent
growth seen in the same period of last year.</P>
      <P>Cross-strait trade reached US$1.8 billion in August, including a
4.4 percent decline to US$1.5 billion in exports and a 10.5 percent
increase to US$296 million in imports, giving the island a trade
surplus of US$1.21 billion with the mainland, or 7.4 percent lower
than it enjoyed in the same month last year.</P>
      <P>Although the mainland's fast-growing exports have stimulated
Taiwan's own exports, the BOFT warned that the increasing
appreciation pressure building up on the mainland currency by
mainland China's huge current account surplus, coupled with the
mainland's blunted competitive edge after the sharp depreciation of
currencies in Southeast Asia, might dampen its orders for Taiwan's
products.</P>

welfare of all of the people in Taiwan, the president said that
before any possible opening of direct shipping, trade and postal
links with mainland China, the administration has to carefully study
what problems might arise from this.</P>
      <P>"It is understandable that businessmen are eager to seek
safeguards for their interests," Lee said. "But as a national leader
I have to take into account the welfare of the entire people of the
nation."</P>
      <P>Lee initiated the so-called "no haste, be patient" policy to
persuade Taiwan businessmen to cool their fervor to make investments
in mainland China, hoping this would press Beijing to renounce its
hostility toward the island.</P>
      <P>Regretting that the mainland leadership has so far snubbed his
repeated offers of an olive branch, Lee said that authorities here
have always kept the door open to negotiations while Beijing has
turned up its nose at all of Taipei's proposals to resume the
cross-strait dialogue.</P>
      <P>Asserting that no personal bias is involved in the government's
mainland policy, Lee said that there is no question that national
security, social stability and the interest of the whole people
should take precedence over the gain of individual businessmen.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEE CAN VISIT M'LAND CHINA IN 'APPROPRIATE' CAPACITY: BEIJING OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Beijing, Oct. 27 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lee Teng-hui, president of the Republic of
China, can fulfill his hope of a "journey of peace" to mainland China
providing he makes the trip in an "appropriate capacity," said a
Beijing official for Taiwan affairs on Monday.</P>
      <P>Backing away from Beijing's insistence that Lee could only visit
mainland China as the head of a Chinese province, Tang Shubei, vice
chairman of the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait, told a group of Taiwan reporters that Lee's capacity
is "an issue that could be negotiated."</P>
      <P>Disputing as groundless a Washington Post report that Beijing
would not deal with Taiwan as long as Lee holds the reins of state in
Taipei, Tang asked Taiwanese reporters who are visiting here along
with a Taiwan youth group, "Whom should we deal with other than Lee?"</P>
      <P>Tang said that the dialogue between Taipei and Beijing can resume
whenever Taiwan authorities respond affirmatively to mainland
President Jiang Zemin's proposal of ending cross-strait hostility
under the principle of "one China."</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S INTERESTS WON'T BE HURT IN SUMMIT TALKS: HU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  27  (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign Minister Jason Hu reiterated on
Monday that the United States has assured the Republic of China on
many occasions that the coming summit talks between US President Bill
Clinton and mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin will not hurt the
interests of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hu said that even with Washington's reassurances, Taipei still
has to watch closely the results of the summit meeting, and at the
same time prepare itself for any possible changes in US policy toward
mainland China or Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Two working teams -- one at the Foreign Ministry and the other at
the National Security Council -- have been formed to help the
government grasp the developments at the summit talks on Oct. 28, Hu
said, adding that the teams will work round the clock Oct. 28-30.</P>
      <P>Responding to questions from legislators, Hu said that what most
concerns the government is whether the Washington-Beijing talks, the
first of their kind in 12 years, will endanger the security of
Taiwan. Jiang is expected to demand that the United States halt its
arms sales to Taiwan, but Hu said he doesn't believe Clinton will
make any concessions on this or other Taiwan issues.</P>
      <P>Hu said that the ROC government has made its demands clear that
the US government should not engage Beijing at the expense of Taiwan,
and that when the United States improves its relations with mainland
China it should also increase its exchanges with Taiwan. While saying
that he believes the US government has shown good will to Taiwan's
demands, Hu said that the ROC government's next goal is to make
Washington treat its relations with Taipei parallel to its ties with
Beijing.</P>
      <P>Asked whether there is a "hot line" between Clinton and President
Lee Teng-hui and if he ever met Clinton during his recently-concluded
tenure as the ROC's de facto ambassador to the United States, Hu said
that national security concerns prevent him from answering such
questions.</P>
      <P>Hu stressed the importance of "pragmatic diplomacy," saying that
the ROC has no choice but to make more efforts to expand its profile
in the international community amid Beijing's persistent attempts to
shunt Taiwan aside internationally.</P>
      <P>Hu, however, stressed that pragmatic diplomacy is not aimed at
creating "two Chinas" or an independent Taiwan but rather at securing
Taiwan's existence in the international community.</P>
      <P>The government realizes that "the unification of the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait will serve the interests of both sides, while the
long-term separation won't do any party good," Hu said.</P>
      <P>Hu urged Beijing to stop fighting "zero-sum" battles with Taipei
in the international community, saying that Taiwan has no intention
to fight against mainland China internationally. Taiwan would instead
like to enhance its communication with the mainland to seek mutual
trust for cross-strait relations, Hu said.</P>

      <P>Lee Ching-ping, deputy secretary-general of
the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), will travel with a postal
delegation to the mainland next month, SEF officials said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The delegation will be led by Wang Wei, deputy director-general
of the Directorate General of Office.</P>
      <P>Accompanying the delegation will be Lee and another SEF official,
You Juei-teh, director of SEF's Department of Legal Service, as well

      <P>The group will leave for the mainland Nov. 10 to visit postal
establishments in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Fuzhou and Xiamen. It
is expected to return to Taipei Nov. 23.</P>
      <P>SEF officials said that though the SEF and its mainland
counterpart -- the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait
-- have yet to resume formal talks and regular communication
channels, contacts between the two intermediary bodies have been
smooth and uninterrupted.</P>
      <P>Regular dialogues between the SEF and ARATS were suspended by
Beijing following President Lee Teng-hui's visit to the United States
in June 1995. With leaders on both sides of the Taiwan Strait
expressing desire to resume talks in recent months, there has been
speculation that the dialogue could restart early next year.</P>
      <P>Observers note that with the visit to Taiwan of Liu
Kangchi, ARATS deputy secretary-general, in early August to attend a

    <HEADLINE>FUND MAY BE RELEASED TO DEFEND STOCK MARKET: CHIU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 28 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Finance Minister Paul C.H. Chiu on Tuesday
repeated calls on investors to have confidence in Taiwan's economy
and said that his ministry is considering the release of a stock
relief fund to stabilize the local bourse.</P>
      <P>Chiu made the remarks after an emergency meeting with Central
Bank of China (CBC) officials this morning in the wake of a US stock
market rout on Monday, in which the Dow Jones industrial average
plummeted by 554 points, the largest single-day drop in history.</P>
      <P>The slide has triggered a chain reaction in stock markets
worldwide. The weighted index, the key barometer of the Taiwan Stock
Exchange, fell by 452.52 points to 7,210.01, or a 5.93 percent
decrease, the largest point fall and the largest percentage fall
since June 7, 1990 and Oct. 8, 1994, respectively.</P>
      <P>The market turnover shrank to NT$79.6 billion and a total of 1.71
billion shares changed hands.</P>
      <P>Chiu told CNA that the Finance Ministry and the CBC decided at
Tuesday's meeting to provide the local bourse with sufficient
floating capital and that officials will release a stock relief fund
if such a move becomes necessary to help stabilize the stock market.</P>
      <P>The nation's chief finance official also called on stock
investors to remain calm, saying that Taiwan's economy is in good
shape and the local stock market is relatively stable compared with
the bourse in other countries.</P>
      <P>Vice Finance Minister Wu Chia-sheng revealed that the Finance
Ministry is poised to take necessary measures to reinvigorate the
stock market, but denied that the ministry is planning to suspend
daily trading or to narrow the 7 percent cap on the market's daily
increase and decline limit.</P>
      <P>Schive Chi, vice chairman of the Council for Economic Planning
and Development (CEPD), said he believes that Taiwan will soon
recover from the financial upheavals currently plaguing the whole
world, stating that Taiwan's economy is sound and good.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the CEPD respects measures by other government
agencies to simulate the stock market and that maintaining Taiwan's
economic growth remains the council's top priority.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, academics and scholars praised the government's
determination to defend the local bourse, saying that intervention
under the present circumstances will be helpful to rebuilding
investor confidence amid the serious crisis.</P>
      <P>Cheng Yuan-po, a research fellow at the Chung-Hua Institute for
Economic Research, said the monetary turmoil originating in Southeast
Asian countries has unleashed a "vicious cycle" in global stock and
financial markets and that many governments have already begun to
take measures to defend their economies.</P>
      <P>Chung Chin, a researcher with the Institute of Economics under
Academia Sinica, said the effect of the government's intervention
measures remain to be seen, but voiced support for such moves. He
attributed the wave of stock market declines worldwide to a lack of
confidence.</P>
      <P>Chung expressed the belief that the government's announcement of
its intention to release funds to defend the stock market will help
restore investor confidence, thus forestalling further damage to the
local economy.</P>

between US President Bill Clinton and mainland Chinese President
Jiang Zemin at the White House.</P>
      <P>The Green Party, Taiwan Independence Alliance and legislators
from the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) announced in a
press conference Tuesday morning that they will gather at the 2-28
Memorial Park in downtown Taipei on Wednesday night for a
demonstration and sit-down vigil.</P>
      <P>The groups said they will urge the United States not to pursue
business interests with mainland China at the expense of Taiwan and
not to bow to the lobbying efforts of US businessmen who seek the
sale of nuclear equipment and technology to the mainalnd.</P>
      <P>Kao Cheng-yen, convenor of the Green Party, said that US
businessmen, targeting the mainland nuclear energy market, have been
aggressively lobbying Washington to lift its ban on nuclear exports
to the mainland.</P>
      <P>Pro-Taiwan independence activist and DPP Legislator Chen
Yung-hsing said the US should not export nuclear reactors and related
technology to the mainland as it would pose threat to the Asian and
Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Legislator Hsieh Tsung-min, also of the DPP, said nuclear energy
proliferation is contrary to the world trend, and the US must oppose
such sales in the interest of world peace.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a spokesman for a Taiwan independence alliance in the
United States said it will mobilize overseas Chinese to parade around
the White House and march to Capitol Hill on Wednesday. He said the
group will urge the United States to respect the rights of Taiwan
people to choose the course of their own future.</P>
      <P>The organization will also join other groups in a demonstration
in front of the Washington Monument on Wednesday as well as mobilize
Taiwanese groups in Philadelphia, New York, Boston and Los Angeles to

    <HEADLINE>CONTROVERSIAL CIRCUS TO DEBUT TUESDAY NIGHT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 28 (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The American Universal Circus will make its
debut in Taiwan on Tuesday amid claims by local animal rights
activists that the spectacular performances are a result of cruel
training methods.</P>
      <P>The New Aspect Cultural and Educational Foundation, the local
sponsor of the event, said that Tuesday night's performance in Taipei
County is a charity event to entertain and benefit children from
orphanages and disadvantaged groups. The circus will stage more than
200 paid performances around the island during a six-month period, it
said.</P>
      <P>Until Nov. 16, the circus will remain in Chungho, Taipei County,
under a big top which can accommodate some 4,000 spectators. The
price of admission ranges between NT$500 and NT$1,800.</P>
      <P>The American Universal Circus, organized by British promoter
Philip Sandey, is composed of some 80 performers including trapeze
artists and acrobats from around the world. The animals include seven
tigers from a circus in America, seven bears from the Moscow State
Circus and four sea lions, as well as performing dogs, cats, horses
and geese.</P>
      <P>Sandey said in a press conference on Monday that the performers
and animals are like a happy family, denying that the animals had
been trained with cruel methods, such as the use of whips, as claimed
by the local animal rights activists.</P>
      <P>Hsu Po-yun, president of New Aspect, said that the introduction
of the animals into Taiwan for the performances has obtained approval
from the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species,
signaling that the international watchdog organization is confident
of the organizer's ability to protect the animals.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that the company has made every effort to protect the
public's safety during the performances, adding that each spectator
is insured against accidents in the amount of NT$500,000 and that
each performer and staff member is insured for NT$2 million.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chao Yung-ching said Monday that he would push for a
ban on performances by the domesticated animals on the basis of an
animal protection bill, which is currently under review in the
Legislative Yuan. He indicated that he will also attempt to push
through an amendment to the ROC Wildlife Protection Act, eliminating
a clause that allows performances by wild animals in circuses.</P>
      <P>Ling Shiang-nung, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Council of
Agriculture, said that animal performances under professional
supervision are rarely prohibited anywhere in the world. Approval for
the circus to tour Taiwan lies within the power of the Education
Ministry, rather than his council, Lin said, adding that the COA will
look into any allegations of abuse regarding the animals.</P>

    <HEADLINE>QUEEN ELIZABETH ATTENDS OPENING OF TAIWAN-INVESTED FIRM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Glasgow, Scotland, Oct. 28 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Queen Elizabeth II of Britain on
Monday pressed a button to open a Taiwan-invested computer peripheral
production facility in Scotland.</P>
      <P>The plant, with six production lines, was invested by Chunghwa
Picture Tubes Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Tatung Co., which
was the first Taiwan business group to invest in Britain, starting in
the 1980s.</P>
      <P>This was the first time that the British queen has attended
Taiwan-related business activities, marking a new milestone in
substantive relations between the Republic of China and Britain.</P>
      <P>Queen Elizabeth said in her brief address that she was delighted
to see the opening of the new plant, saying it indicates that Britain
is an ideal investment destination in Europe for Taiwan investors.</P>
      <P>The Chunghwa plant is expected to help revitalize the British
economy, the queen said, adding she is convinced that the new jobs
and opportunities offered by the facility will give Scottish
residents more confidence in their future.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the Glasgow community, Queen Elizabeth accepted a
batch of computers donated by Chunghwa Picture to four elementary
schools in the region and Glasgow University.</P>
      <P>The British government is attaching great importance to the
Chunghwa investment project as it will create the largest number of
jobs ever by a foreign company in Scotland.</P>
      <P>Scottish Secretary Donald Dewar, ROC Representative to Britain
Eugene Chien, and more than 100 other European and Asian well-wishers
also attended the inaugural ceremony.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the occasion, Chunghwa President Lin Chen-yuan said
the company has decided to set up the plant in Scotland mainly
because the region is a stronghold of high-technology industries. In
addition to the large cluster of computer companies in the region,
Scotland also offers adequate supplies of skilled labor and trained
professionals as well as other advantages.</P>
      <P>Lin expressed his gratitude for the financial subsidies and other
investment incentives offered by the British government.</P>
      <P>Chunghwa unveiled its US$2.07 billion (1.26 billion British
pound) investment plan in late 1995 and construction began in 1996.
The first-phase construction was completed earlier this year.</P>
      <P>The plant will manufacture computer monitors and cathode ray
tubes. Initially, the facility will be able to produce 7.2 million
units annually, with capacity increasing to 10 million units when
construction is completed.</P>
      <P>Tatung Co. Chairman Lin Ting-sheng also traveled from Taiwan to
Scotland to attend the opening of the new Chunghwa plant. He said
that following the opening of the Scotland factory, Chunghwa Picture
Tubes will build a production facility in the United States in the
near future.</P>
      <P>Chunghwa already has production facilities in Taiwan's Taoyuan
and Yangmei districts, mainland China's Fuzhou city and in Malaysia.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JIANG'S DIPLOMATIC GUIDELINES TOWARD US TAKE POSITIVE TONE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  28  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin's
changes in the wording of Beijing's guidelines for its relationship
with Washington underline the positive tone he hopes will take root
at his first state visit to the United States this week, boosting
relations between the two major powers.</P>
      <P>Before the most recent changes, the diplomatic guidelines read
that Beijing and Washington should aim at "increasing mutual trust,
diminishing trouble, promoting cooperation, and preventing
confrontations."</P>
      <P>The principle of "increasing mutual trust and diminishing
trouble" appeared first in a speech of Deng Xiaoping, the late
paramount leader of mainland China, about the Beijing-Washington
relationship after the Tienanmen Square massacre in 1989; Jiang added
"promoting cooperation and preventing confrontations" several years
later. The combination of the two formed Beijing's diplomatic
guidelines toward Washington.</P>
      <P>When Jiang met with Samuel R. Berger, assistant to the US
President for National Security Affairs, on Aug. 13, however, he
didn't repeat the above diplomatic principle but instead said the two
sides should "expand common ground, enhance trust, diminish
differences and join hands to create the future."</P>
      <P>The differences in the wording are plain. Negative words such as
"trouble" and "confrontations" have been replaced by positive terms
like "trust" and "create the future." The final phrase is especially
indicative that Jiang has long been preparing for his visit and is
keeping his eye on long-term bilateral relations between Beijing and
Washington.</P>
      <P>The Jiang additions to the Deng diplomatic guidelines were
published one month after Jiang was elected general secretary of the
Chinese Communist Party (CCP) at the 14th CCP National Congress;
while the latest guidelines were officially promulgated one month
after he was re-elected to the top CCP spot at the party's 15th
National Congress.</P>
      <P>This indicates that having won the internal power struggle and
solidified his authority, Jiang can commit himself to promoting the
development of foreign relations, especially with the United States.</P>
      <P>Although both Washington and Beijing are hoping to improve their
bilateral relationship, a number of factors are working against a
large change for the better and so Jiang's achievements during his
current US visit will probably be limited.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DIGNITY IS TOP CONCERN IN ARRANGING LEE'S M'LAND VISIT: SIEW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  28  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui would make a
"journey of peace" to mainland China only if such a visit could take
place in a dignified manner, Premier Vincent Siew said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Siew made the statement at a Legislative Yuan
question-and-answer session. His remarks followed local press
reports which quoted Tang Shubei, vice president of the
Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait
(ARATS) as saying that Taiwan's top leader is welcome to visit the
mainland in an appropriate "capacity."</P>
      <P>Siew said President Lee already declared in his inaugural speech
that with the support of the 21 million people of Taiwan, he is
willing to make a "journey of peace" to the mainland to forge
rapprochement.</P>
      <P>The premier, who once served as chairman of the Mainland Affairs
Council, which charts Taiwan's policy toward mainland China, said
the proposed "journey of peace" would be in national interests and
win popular support only if it takes place in a dignified manner.</P>
      <P>"So our stance is that whether President Lee would visit the
mainland hinges on the way the journey would take place," Siew said,
adding "dignity" is the top concern.</P>
      <P>Siew, who had handshakes with mainland Chinese President Jiang
Zemin when he twice represented President Lee in the annual informal
leadership meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum
during his stint as chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development, said Taiwan has consistently kept its door open for
cross-strait talks.</P>
      <P>It was Beijing that unilaterally suspended regular cross-strait
dialogue in mid-1995, Siew noted, adding that the ROC government has
repeatedly called for early resumption of cross-strait
consultations. "We hope mainland China would make a positive
response to our call and resume bilateral talks without imposing any
preconditions. Although we hope to resolve some non-political
administrative and technical issues first, we do not rule out the
possibility of conducting political talks," he added.</P>
      <P>Siew went on to say that the direct "three links" across the
Taiwan Strait would be possible only when the cross-strait relations
are normalized.</P>
      <P>"The greatest obstacle to the opening of direct cross-strait
trad communications and transport links is Beijing resistance to
recognize Taipei as an equal political entity," Siew stressed,
adding that the country would make concessions on the "three links"
issue simply for joining the World Trade Organization or for
facilitating the development of Taiwan into a regional business hub.</P>
      <P>Siew further said the government has been closely monitoring
developments in the mainland president's current visit to the United
States.</P>
      <P>"Although the US government has repeatedly assured us that the
upcoming summit meeting between President Bill Clinton and Jiang
will not undermine our national interests, we are still paying close
attention to the event," Siew noted, adding the ROC insists that
Taipei-Washington relations run parallel to Beijing-Wanshington
ties.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Nine leaders of the Taiwan Independence
Party (TIP) left for the United States Tuesday afternoon to stage
demonstrations in Los Angeles and Washington on the occasion of
mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin's state visit to the United
States.</P>
      <P>TIP Chairman Lee Chen-yuan said at a pre-departure news
conference that Jiang is expected to reiterate Beijing's claim that
"Taiwan is part of China" when he meets with President Bill Clinton
Wednesday at the White House. And President Clinton has said that
Taiwan issues should be resolved in peaceful ways by the Chinese on
the two sides of the Taiwan Straits.</P>
      <P>"But Taiwanese are not Chinese. Taiwan is Taiwan, and China is
China. This is the position of the Taiwan Independence Party," Lee
said at the press conference.</P>
      <P>Lee said Taiwan's future and safety are very important to the
Taiwanese people. Therefore, the nine TIP leaders want to stage
demonstrations in the United States to make their ideas known to the
American government and people, and to let Jiang know that he has no
right to interfere with the self-determination of Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>The nine TIP leaders will join with Taiwanese American
sympathizers of Taiwan independence in demonstrations during Jiang's
visits to the two cities this week.</P>
      <P>One supporter of TIP chased and beat a photographer at the 
pre-departure press conference after the latter was found not a
news reporter. The violence led to a brief confrontation with the

      <P>Australia's gold industry, the world's
third biggest bullion producer and exporter, is under serious threat
after Switzerland announced the sale of 1,440 tons of bullion
reserves.</P>
      <P>Analysts predicted that bullion prices could slump to as low as

      <P>Australia produced about 300 tons of gold in fiscal 1996-97 and
production is expected to rise to 330 tons before settling at a lower
volume, analysts said.</P>
      <P>Australia sells its gold to many countries, including Japan,
Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore. Its gold industry, worth about A$4
billion a year, is braced for further sharp falls amid warnings of
mine closures, a halt to exploration and a new round of merger
activity, analysts said.</P>
      <P>Gold prices plunged to US$308.05 per ounce in Asian trading on
Monday due to speculation over the Swiss selloff, the lowest price

    <HEADLINE>CANADIAN COLUMNIST SUPPORTS TIBET'S INDEPENDENCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Oct. 27 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Tibet should be an independent nation, but
"political reality dictates otherwise," a Canadian analyst said
Monday.</P>
      <P>Beijing,, which does have some legitimate historical claim to
Tibet, "will never voluntarily relinquish this highly strategic
nation," observed Eric Margolic, foreign affairs analyst for the Sun
newspapers in Canada.</P>
      <P>Margolic, who has visited Tibet and met its spiritual leader, the
Dalai Lama, reported that 5 million of Tibet's 7 million people have
been detached from their homeland and absorbed by neighboring
mainland Chinese provinces. "Millions of Han Chinese settlers have
been moved into Tibet, turning Tibetans into a minority in their own
nation," he added.</P>
      <P>Beijing sporadically tries to eradicate Tibetan culture and
religion, he said. He emphasized, "While China condemns Israel in the
UN for colonizing the West Bank, it colonizes Tibet."</P>
      <P>Chinese rule has brought some benefits, a fact overlooked in the
West, according to the analyst whose article appeared in the Monday
edition of the Ottawa Sun. "China built roads, schools, power lines
and hospitals; it ended illiteracy and serfdom," he pointed out.</P>
      <P>However, with these benefits came "political and cultural
repression, Red Guards and China's dreaded gulag system, the 'lao
gai,'" he noted.</P>
      <P>No Western nation dares incur Beijing's wrath by recognizing
Tibet, and Tibetans themselves lack the necessary arms to oust
Beijing by guerrilla warfare, he wrote. Besides, he continued, an
independent Tibet would probably be gobbled up by India -- just as
India annexed Bhutan, Goa, Sikkim and ethnic-Tibetan Ladakh without a
peep of protest from the West.</P>
      <P>What is the realistic course of action for the West? "The best we
can do is keep pressing China to allow Tibet full political, cultural
and religious autonomy and cease colonization," he suggested.</P>
      <P>The exiled Dalai Lama says he will agree to such a solution,
Margolic pointed out; "but Beijing fears him, and even a semi-free
Tibet that might come under Indian influence." Uprisings in Muslim
Xinjiang already make Beijing "nervous and truculent," he noted.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, he said keeping up demands for Tibetan autonomy is
a good fight. "Just don't allow Hollywood to hijack, commercialize
and cheapen this issue," since there is no faster way to undermine
and sully a just cause than making it the subject of brainless films,
posturing politicians and vapid cocktail parties, he said.</P>
      <P>He ridiculed Hollywood's "champagne liberals" for making Tibet "a
highly fashionable cause" these days. Hollywood's Tibetan passion in
making such films as "Seven Years in Tibet" is "a self-serving fad,"
he said.
 He reminded readers that Hollywood people, particularly actors,
are "the great know-nothings of our age." "When one of them start
talking about politics, economics or social policy, switch channels,"
he advised.</P>

      <P>The Republic of China has been rated the
fourth most socially stable economy among 12 countries and areas in
Asia in 1997, said the Hong Kong-based Political and Economic Risk
Consultancy (PERC).</P>
      <P>In the findings of a survey devoted to social unrest in Asia,
PERC said that Singapore was regarded by respondents as the most
socially stable economy in Asia.</P>
      <P>On a scale of zero to 10, Singapore was ranked top with a level
of less than one, showing that it has the lowest degree of risk for
social unrest among the 12 Asian economies surveyed.</P>
      <P>Japan was second, with a level of marginally above one, followed
by Hong Kong at 2.7. The ROC ranked fourth with a level of about 3.5
on the scale for 1997, showing a big improvement from last year's
4.5.</P>
      <P>Next, in descending order, were Thailand, Malaysia, the
Philippines, mainland China, Vietnam, India, South Korea and
Indonesia, with a rating of 6.6.</P>
      <P>PERC said that Singapore's performance in the recent Southeast
Asian currency crisis had enhanced its reputation as a regional
financial center.</P>
      <P>Singapore has done its best to maintain a low profile and has
avoided direct criticism of Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad, a vocal critic of the alleged role of Western speculators in
the recent crises, PERC said in the latest issue of its newsletter,

    <DATELINE>Asuncion,   Oct.  27  (CNA)
(By Stephen Sheng)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The 56th plenary meeting of the
International Cotton Advisory Committee (ICAC) was held Monday in
Asuncion, with about 400 participants from more than 30 countries.</P>
      <P>Official delegations are made up of government representatives
and advisors from the private sector. The delegation of the Republic
of China is lead by Mr. Juhn C.C. Deng, the director of the Economic
Division of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in
the United States.</P>
      <P>Deng said that the ICAC is an intergovernmental organization, the
majority of whose members are cotton producers.</P>
      <P>Although the ROC does not produce cotton, it is a major importer
of the commodity. In order to keep abreast of current trends in the
production and marketing of cotton, the ROC sent a seven-member
delegation comprised of government officials and industry specialists
to the ICAC meeting.</P>
      <P>Discussion at the committee's plenary meeting will center on
recent developments in supply of and demand for cotton, as well as
industry trade patterns and price levels.</P>
      <P>It was noted that, while cotton has maintained a strong share of
the textile fiber market in the United States, it has declined in
importance in Europe and the developing countries. On a global basis,
cotton's share of that market has fallen from 50% in 1987 to 45% in
1995. Current forecasts suggest that the share will drop further to
43% in the next few years.</P>
      <P>The ICAC was found in 1939 by 10 cotton-producing nations. Its
first plenary meeting was held in Washington the following year. In
the fifth meeting it was decided to invite importers of cotton to
join the organization.</P>
      <P>Currently, the ICAC has about 40 members. The ROC, under the name
"China (Taiwan)," has been a member for about thirty years, although
mainland China has recently expressed interest in joining, to the
exclusion of the ROC.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 28 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The first professional aerospace fasteners
production facility in the Asia-Pacific region was born in Taiwan on
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Royal Aerospace Industry Co. struck a technological
cooperation deal with NAFCO of the United States for joint production
of aerospace fasteners on the island.</P>
      <P>The cooperative project, mediated by the Industrial Development
Bureau and the Committee for Aviation and Space Industry Development
under the Minsitry of Economic Affairs (MOEA), marks a critical step
forward in the local private sector's participation in producing high
value-added aerospace parts and components.</P>
      <P>The agreement was signed by Royal Aerospace Chairman Huang
Meng-chu and NAFCO Chief Executive Willy Robin at the MOEA
auditorium, with Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Yin Chi-ming
witnessing.</P>
      <P>Under the agreement, NAFCO will transfer technological know-how
for Royal Aeropsace to produce aircraft/spacecraft fasteners,
including internally threaded fasteners, self-locking press in
inserts, self-locking nut plates, collars and tube fittings.</P>
      <P>Royal Aerospace has invested NT$200 million (US$6.57 million) in
building the aerospace fasteners production facility.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the occasion, Yin said fasteners are indispensable
key components and parts in the aerospace industry. Their market
prices are 50 times those for traditional screws and nuts.</P>
      <P>"Once its products pass certification, the company will be able
to receive orders incessantly," Yin said, adding that the
Royal-NAFCO cooperative project marks the beginning of the local
traditional screws/nuts industry moving toward high-technology and
toward the international aerospace market.</P>
      <P>Yin said the demand for aerospace fasteners in the
booming Asia-Pacific region will increase substantially in the years
ahead, with the annual sales expected to reach US$400 million to
US$600 million.</P>
      <P>In addition to setting its eye at the Asia-Pacific aerospace
market, the Royal-NAFCO joint venture is also expected to become a
major fastener supplier for the domestic high-speed railway system.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA SEES BIGGER IMPACT IF SOUTHEAST ASIAN CRISIS SPREADS NORTH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct.  28 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia, already hit by the financial
and securities turmoil in Southeast Asia, is worried the current
crisis will spread north -- to Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan and South
Korea -- as the majority of its exports go to this region.</P>
      <P>Treasurer Peter Costello told reporters Monday that Australia's
economy would be hit much harder if the current crisis affecting
Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines and Indonesia spreads to
Northeast Asia.</P>
      <P>He said the impact from Northeast Asian on Australia's economy
would be larger because the volume of its exports to that region is
much larger than that to Southeast Asia.</P>
      <P>Australia's exports to Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea
exceeded A$29.2 billion in fiscal 1996-97. Exports to Japan were
worth A$15.373 billion; to Korea, A$7.13 billion; to Taiwan, A$3.62
billion; and to Hong Kong, A$3.1 billion.</P>
      <P>This comes in comparison to the combined export volume of A$8.55
billion to Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines and Malaysia during
the same period.</P>
      <P>Australia's exports to those four Southeast Asian countries
account for about 10 percent of its total; but exports to the four
Northeast Asian economies account for about 37 percent, according to
official statistics.</P>
      <P>Costello conceded that the impact upon Australia of the Southeast
Asian economic crisis will worsen if the current turbulence in
regional financial markets spreads to the northeast.</P>
      <P>He said Australia, however, was insulated from the worst of the
turmoil in the region by its domestic economic and budgetary reforms
and by its relatively small dependence on trade with Thailand,
Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines, the four countries at the
center of the Asian crisis.</P>
      <P>"When growth turns down in those countries, that will have an
effect on Australia, but it will not be a large effect on Australia
because Australia's exports by destination into those areas is around
10 percent," he said.</P>
      <P>"If other countries with whom we trade should get into
difficulties, that too would affect Australia. If other countries in
North Asia were affected, that would have another effect on
Australia," he added.</P>
      <P>In a speech in Melbourne last night, Foreign Minister Alexander
Downer played down suggestions that Northeast Asia could be a victim
of sentiment against the region's economic performance.</P>

    <DATELINE>Manila,  Oct.  28  (CNA)
(By Timothy Sun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The AIDS epidemic which threatens Asian
economic development can be tamed through regional cooperation and
shared responsibilities, said a senior official of the Asian
Development Bank (ADB) on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"The AIDS epidemic is the enemy of Asian promise," ADB Vice
President Peter Sullivan told delegates here at the fourth
international congress on AIDS in the Asia-Pacific region. "It
threatens in a material way the progress that Asia has made over the
past several decades. It imposes huge economic costs on societies,
families and individuals, and endangers the economic development of
the countries of Asia that have so boldly introduced growth-enhancing
economy-wide reforms."</P>
      <P>Regional or multi-country approaches can be effective since there
are similarities in the nature of the epidemic, he said, citing
cultural and socioeconomic factors which facilitate the transmission
of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.</P>
      <P>Widespread poverty, rapid population growth, increasing mass
migration of labor and a thriving tourism industry will facilitate
the rapid spread of HIV throughout the region, Sullivan said, noting
that forecasts have said that by the turn of the century more new
HIV-infections will occur in Asia than in the rest of the world
combined.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the private sector can play a major role by
providing care facilities, research and development initiatives, and
financial and other types of contributions for anti-HIV/AIDS
activities.</P>
      <P>The ADB has been promoting economic cooperation in the control
and prevention of HIV/AIDS in the greater Mekong subregion, which
encompasses Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam and mainland

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taichung Prosecutors' Office has begun
an investigation into allegations that a teacher, two guards and a
janitor were involved in molesting students who attended the primary
school where they worked.</P>
      <P>Prosecutor Wu Tsuei-fan said that the molestation victims include
nine girls and one boy, all from the same primary school in Taichung.
To help protect the victims' identity, Wu refused to disclose the
name of the school.</P>
      <P>School counseling staff first notified authorities of their
suspicions after learning in counseling sessions that some students
might have been subject to sexual abuse at school. The follow-up
investigation discovered 10 students may have been molested by school
faculty and staff between 1995 and the end of 1996.</P>
      <P>Wu said that most of the victims are from single-parent families
or broken homes. They were usually taken to classrooms or remote
places around the school on Wednesday afternoons, when the school
didn't have regular classes, he said.</P>
      <P>The children, some of them also victims of incest, would receive
NT$10 to NT$200 (US$0.33 to US$6.56) after being molested or even
raped, Wu said.</P>

said, adding that the preliminary investigation points to the four
committing their crimes individually rather than in concert with each
other.</P>

Deby on a visit to a farm in Taichung, central Taiwan. The African
leader arrived here Sunday for a five-day visit.</P>
      <P>Under the BOT model, private enterprises build and operate a
project and then transfer it to the government after a specified
period of time. The most recent example is the first high speed rail
in Taiwan to be built by the Taiwan High Speed Rail Consortium.</P>
      <P>Past setbacks in the ROC's attempts to develop relations with
African nations led Taipei to exert relatively little effort in the
region for nearly a decade, resulting in many nations in that
continent lacking an understanding of the ROC, Hu said.</P>
      <P>But when African nations understand Taiwan better, they will know
that the ROC is a trustworthy friend, he said.</P>
      <P>Hu said that now is the time to rethink foreign policy, adding
that if Taiwan gets its friends to understand that bilateral
relations will cover more than just one area then the relations could
turn out to be more lasting.</P>
      <P>Hu said that bilateral relations should be grounded on mutually
beneficial cooperation. Citing the BOT model practiced on major
public works, he said this same model could apply to diplomatic
efforts.</P>
      <P>Noting that many countries need help with their basic
construction works, he said that if Taiwan could help them with these
then this would not only help forge more lasting relations between
the ROC and those countries but also help increase their
understanding of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Vice Foreign Minister Chen Chien-jen said at a
question-and-answer session at the Legislative Yuan on Tuesday that
the current focus of diplomatic efforts is wider than soliciting more
countries to establish formal ties with the ROC.</P>
      <P>Chen said that for the survival and development of the 21 million
people on the island, the government will also have to develop
substantial ties with those nations that currently do not maintain
official relations with the ROC.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that in addition to having diplomatic ties with 30
countries, the ROC is also actively promoting substantial relations
with over 140 additional nations.</P>
      <P>He said that the government will also actively participate in
international activities and organizations, adding that the ROC
currently participates in 42 international organizations and over 930
non-governmental organizations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>APEC SUMMIT TO STRESS STRENGTH OF APEC ECONOMIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore, Oct. 28 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
leaders are expected to make a strong statement on the positive
long-term growth prospects of Asia-Pacific economies at their annual
summit next month to help restore financial stability to the region
and revive investor confidence, said a senior APEC official Monday.</P>
      <P>Leonard Edwards, chairman of the APEC Senior Officials' Meeting
which opened in Singapore on Monday, said the economic fundamentals
of Asian countries remain strong and that APEC economies are on track
in their trade liberalization goals.</P>
      <P>The two-day APEC meeting was held to prepare for the Fifth APEC
Economic Leaders' Meeting, to be held in Vancouver, Canada next
month.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the regional financial crisis and trade
liberalization, Edwards said: "The message that we are getting is one
of continuing interest in liberalization. Canada's view is that
liberalization can strengthen economies and help them withstand the
buffeting that they have faced in the last few months.</P>
      <P>"More open economies with better supervision and a freer flow of
goods and services create a sounder basis from which economies can go
forward."</P>
      <P>The APEC leaders' note of confidence in the Asia-Pacific region
would be reflected in their declaration winding up the summit meeting
on November 25, Edwards said.</P>
      <P>The turmoil following the collapse of the Thai baht in early July
has sent regional stock markets and currencies reeling.</P>
      <P>The rout has even dented sentiments in Europe and the United
States.</P>
      <P>Ambassador John Wolf, the US coordinator of APEC affairs, said
APEC members have been showing "a lot of vitality" in bringing down
trade barriers and making headway in many sectors.</P>
      <P>Edwards said leaders would also pledge their commitment at the
Vancouver meeting for "a continuing strong momentum on investment and
trade liberalization and give a strong endorsement on the need for
infrastructure development."</P>
      <P>He underscored the importance of infrastructure development and
said it is vital to economic growth and opening up markets.</P>
      <P>Canada also wants to see greater private-sector involvement in
the APEC process, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO SIGN INDUSTRIAL ALLIANCE PACT WITH MERCK AG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 28 (CNA)
(By Debbie Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) is
slated to sign a letter of intent with Germany's Merck AG on
Wednesday forming a strategic industrial alliance.</P>
      <P>Economic Affairs Minister Wang Chih-kang and Merck Chairman Hans
J. Langmann will jointly ink the pact at the ministry.</P>
      <P>Under the agreement, both sides will first cooperate on chemical
and display technologies and eventually jointly explore Asia-Pacific
markets.</P>
      <P>The pact will be the 50th of its kind since the MOEA embarked on
a mission in 1993 to form strategic alliances with foreign
enterprises. It will also be the sixth signed between Taiwan and a
German firm, said MOEA officials.</P>
      <P>Merck is a world-renowned multinational enterprise which produces
precision chemicals, electronic chemicals, laboratory reagents and
biochemicals.</P>
      <P>Merck maintains 28 production centers around the world and 166
sales footholds in 47 countries. Having 27,000 employees worldwide on
its payroll, the company posted a business turnover of nearly US$4.2
billion last year.</P>
      <P>The German chemicals giant first stepped into the Taiwan market
in 1972. Since 1991, it has expanded into joint ventures with Taiwan
firms to produce electronics-related chemicals here.</P>
      <P>Merck has invested about NT$1.8 billion (US$60 million) in its
Taiwan joint-venture firms, including Merck Taiwan, which produces
lab reagents, detergents and biochemicals; Merck Display Technology,
which makes liquid crystals and ITO coatings; and Merck-Kanto, which
turns out process and integrated chemicals.</P>
      <P>The cooperation projects under the 49 strategic industrial and
business alliances the MOEA signed prior to the Merck deal total
US$4.1 billion.</P>
      <P>Among the investments covered by these agreements are the US$1.7
billion Germany's Siemens has put into the production of 256M memory,
and the US$330 million Philips of the Netherlands has committed to
production of high-definition color displays.</P>
      <P>In addition, MOEA officials noted, 23 multinational corporations,
including Texas Instrument and Dupont, have established their
Asia-Pacific operations centers in Taiwan.</P>

(By Debbie Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Relations between mainland China and the
United States are expected to become closer in the wake of the
Clinton-Jiang summit, which will simultaneously offer a golden
opportunity for Taipei to improve its ties with Washington, Foreign
Affairs Minister Jason Hu said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Hu said that while improving ties with mainland China, Washington
should improve its relations with Taiwan on a parallel track.
"Otherwise, when the balance of power across the Taiwan Strait favors
one side over the other, the peace and stability that both the US and
Taiwan have tried hard to secure in the region will be seriously
impeded," he noted.</P>
      <P>While Washington and Beijing are engaging in fence-mending,
Taipei should further boost its diplomatic efforts toward America,
seeking stronger support from the US people and increasing their
understanding of Taiwan, Hu stressed.</P>
      <P>Echoing remarks made two days ago by Premier Vincent Siew that
the United States should integrate Taiwan into a US-inspired regional
peace system, Hu said he does not see any reason for the US and
Taiwan not to cooperate, since the two states share a common national
founding spirit and identical goals for the region.</P>
      <P>He also said he does not exclude the possibility of President Lee
Teng-hui making a "journey of peace" to mainland China when the time
is ripe for such a visit.</P>
      <P>Hu's remarks came during a luncheon in the central city of
Taichung in honor of President Idriss Deby of the Republic of Chad,
who is currently in Taiwan for a five-day state visit.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 28 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's per-project investment in mainland
China has been reduced in recent months due to brakes applied by the
ROC government, although the total number of investments has surged,
according to statistics prepared by the Ministry of Economic Affairs
(MOEA).</P>
      <P>In the first three-quarters of this year, the ministry has
approved 441 investment projects in the mainland, an increase of 54.7
percent over the same period of last year, with an increase in value
of only 14.3 percent, for a total of US$1.09 billion.</P>
      <P>An amnesty for firms investing in the mainland without government
approval is also responsible for the sudden jump in the number of
projects, said the MOEA.</P>
      <P>Since the amnesty ended on Sept. 30, the 75 new projects in
September alone was 3.69 times greater than the same period of last
year, while the monetary value, at US$161 million, was 2.5 times
greater.</P>
      <P>The five mainland coastal provinces of Jiangsu, Gwangdong,
Zhejiang, Hebei and Fujian are Taiwan investors' favorite locations,
grabbing a joint share of 89.2 percent of Taiwan's total investment,
58.99 percent of which went into electronics\electrical appliances,
non-metal manufactured products, basic metals and related products,
textiles and comestibles.</P>

    <DATELINE>Geneva,  Oct. 28 (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More and more children are working for low
pay cutting and polishing precious stones in western India, according
to reports from the Geneva-based World Trade Organization (WTO) on
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"Diamonds, rubies and sapphires are associated with the world of
the rich and glamorous," Bill Jordan, Secretary General of the
International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), was quoted
as saying.</P>
      <P>"Multinational and local companies are making vast profits, but
at best they turn a blind eye and at worst they are happy to reap the
benefits (from the exploitation of children)."</P>
      <P>The WTO report said India is the world's diamond- and
gemstone-cutting center, polishing about 70 percent of the global
diamond yield. Yet the workers often receive poverty wages and work
in conditions that leave them with lung disease and half-blind.</P>
      <P>An estimated 10 to 20 percent of the 800,000 people in India
engaged in diamond cutting and polishing are children. Trade
unionists say employers prefer children since they are easier to
exploit and much cheaper. Wages average just 1 percent of the
wholesale price of each diamond.</P>
      <P>Although the gem and jewelry industry currently provides 17
percent of its export earnings, India does not mine the diamonds and
gemstones polished there. Its main supplier of diamonds is the Rio
Tinto-controlled Argyle mine in western Australia, followed by the
Central Selling Organization, the marketing arm of De Beers, based in
London, the WTO report said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui and his Chad
counterpart Idriss Deby on Tuesday exchanged citations, in a move
symbolizing solid and long-lasting friendship between the Republic of
China and the Republic of Chad.</P>
      <P>Lee conferred the Order of Brilliant Jade with Grand Cordon on
Deby in recognition of his outstanding contribution to enhanced
bilateral ties, while Deby decorated Lee with the Grand Cross Medal,
Chad's ultimate symbol of respect.</P>
      <P>The conferment ceremony was held at the Presidential Office on
Tuesday evening, witnessed by Vice President Lien Chan, Foreign
Affairs Minister Jason Hu, his Chad counterpart Mahamat Saleh Annadif
and other ranking officials from both sides.</P>
      <P>After the ceremony, both heads of state expressed the sentiment
that the conferment was not directed only toward the two of them, but
also to their two countries. Both men vowed to further strengthen
cooperative bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>Lee said Deby's visit is particularly significant since the two
countries resumed formal diplomatic relations just two months ago
after a 25-year hiatus. The two governments maintained cordial and
close ties between 1962 and 1972.</P>
      <P>On Monday, Deby said in a welcoming ceremony in his honor that
many Chad people still remember the competence and down-to-earth
working style of ROC agricultural experts stationed in his country in
the 1960s and are grateful for their legacy.</P>
      <P>Maintaining close ties in the fields of agriculture and medical
care, the two countries should further bolster relations in many
other fields on a basis of reciprocity and mutual trust, Lee
stressed.</P>
      <P>Deby, accompanied by a 16-member entourage, arrived in Taiwan on
Sunday for a five-day state visit, his first visit to the island.</P>

(By Debbie Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is not Hong Kong, and the "one
country, two systems" formula Beijing applies to Hong Kong is totally
unsuitable for Taiwan, Vice President Lien Chan told a French weekly
magazine recently.</P>
      <P>In the Oct. 27 issue of Marianne, Lien told French readers that
unlike Hong Kong, which was formerly a British colony, Taiwan is the
seat of the Republic of China, a sovereign nation and Asia's first
republic, founded in 1911.</P>
      <P>Taiwan firmly opposes Beijing's "one country, two systems"
formula, which apparently ignores the ROC's existence and negates the
fact that Taiwan and mainland China are two distinct political
entities separated by the Taiwan Strait, Lien stressed.</P>
      <P>The magazine devoted five full pages of its latest issue to a
report on Taiwan, filed by Sylvie Levey, who interviewed Lien in
person at his office on Aug. 5.</P>
      <P>The report was accompanied by a photo of Lien bearing the
caption: "Vice president of democratic China," together with the
national flags of the ROC and the PRC.</P>
      <P>Responding to a question from Levey on Taiwan's position when the
Chinese communists become capable of launching a military attack on
Taiwan, Lien said that the ROC armed forces are currently working on
a buildup of second-generation military equipment and that the
island's overall combat readiness has already been significantly
bolstered, adding that Taiwan will counter without hesitation any
military assault from across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>In the article, Levey pointed out that the ROC capital, Taipei,
is one of the most important financial hubs in Southeast Asia today
and that Taiwan's per capita income is 26 times that of mainland
China.</P>
      <P>She also wrote that Taiwan categorically rejects any attempt at
"peaceful reunification" of mainland China and Taiwan on terms set by
Beijing.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INBOUND INVESTMENT HITS NEW HIGH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 29 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Approved inbound investment hit a new high
of US$3.23 billion in the first nine months of this year, according
to statistics released by the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) on
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The ministry said the record-setting amount indicates that
Taiwan's general investment climate and the liberalization of its
trade regime have won much recognition in the global business
community.</P>
      <P>The amount marked a 96.72 percent increase over that registered
in the same period of last year, and even exceeded the inbound
investment recorded for the whole of 1995.</P>
      <P>The number of approved inbound investment projects for the
nine-month period reached 489, up 42.15 percent from the year-earlier
level.</P>
      <P>With the overall investment amount growing faster than the number
of investment projects, ministry officials said, the scale of foreign
investment in Taiwan has gradually enlarged.</P>
      <P>The officials further said foreign and overseas Chinese
entrepreneurs still focused their investment in electronics, electric
appliances and metal industries as well as service, insurance and
international trading businesses, accounting for more than 70 percent
of overall inbound investment for the January-September period.</P>
      <P>In September alone, approved inbound investment amounted to
US$272 million, in 74 projects, including three large investment
plans filed by American and Japanese business groups.</P>
      <P>Ministry tallies also showed that the MOEA's Investment
Commission approved 517 outbound investment projects, with an
accumulated amount of US$2.22 billion, during the first three
quarters of this year.</P>
      <P>The outbound investment amount marked a 48 percent year-on-year
rise, while the number of projects increased 46.5 percent, indicating
local business people have remained active in launching overseas
ventures.</P>
      <P>Overseas investment focused on setting up holding companies and
investing in electronics and electric appliance industries as well as
trading and transport services.</P>
      <P>Major investment destinations included the Virgin Islands, United
States, Singapore, Panama and Hong Kong, accounting for 78 percent of
approved overall outbound investment.</P>
      <P>In September, monthly outbound investment totaled US$289 million,
up 85.3 percent from the same month of last year; while the number of
approved projects more than doubled the year-earlier figure to 68.</P>
      <P>Major outbound investment projects during the month included a
US$65.3 million plan filed by Far Eastern Warehousing Co. for setting
up a warehousing facility in Panama and a US$50 million project filed
by CIS Technology for producing microcomputers and related products
in the United States.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, MOEA officials said, Taiwan's per-project investment
in mainland China has declined in recent months due to brakes
applied by the ROC government, although the total number of
cross-strait investment projects has surged.</P>
      <P>In the first three quarters of the year, the MOEA approved 441
investment projects on the mainland, an increase of 54.7 percent
over the same period of last year, with an increase in value of only
14.3 percent, for a total of US$1.09 billion.</P>
      <P>An amnesty for firms investing on the mainland without
government approval is also responsible for the sudden jump in
the number of projects, the officials said. The amnesty ended on
Sept. 30.</P>
      <P>The 75 new investment projects approved in September alone was
3.69 times greater than the same month of last year, while the
monetary value, at US$161 million, was 2.5 times greater, indicating
that the government's "no haste, be patient" policy toward mainland
China has not completely discouraged local business people from
launching new ventures across the Taiwan Strait.</P>

      <P>A Taiwan trade-promotion delegation scored
millions of US dollars worth of business in Latin America during a
recent visit to several spots in the region, the China External Trade
Development Council (CEPD) said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The "1997 Latin American Trade Promotion Delegation," composed of
24 local manufacturers of different sectors, scored more than US$10
million worth of in-site and follow-up business in Puerto Rico,
Venezuela, Peru and Brazil during its stay from Oct. 4-25 in those
places, according to the semi-official trade organization.</P>
      <P>The trade-promotion delegation, the first of its kind ever to
visit Puerto Rico, was warmly received there and, along with local
executives, attended a trade seminar presided over by Puerto Rican
Economics Minister Carlos Vivoni, the CEPD said.</P>
      <P>The delegation's visit to Venezuela and Peru also drew warm
responses from the local business communities because of the improved
economic situation there. While in Venezuela, the delegation reached
agreement on several issues of bilateral trade cooperation with its
local counterparts.</P>
      <P>The CEPD, however, pointed out that the group's efforts to
explore the Brazilian market were less successful, as the country is
troubled by high inflationary pressure as a result of its overheated
economy. It urged Taiwan's manufacturers of computers,
telecommunications equipment and car accessories to explore the vast
Brazilian market, as it is rife with potential business
opportunities.</P>

Protocol met last month in Montreal to mark the 10th anniversary of
the breakthrough treaty on global warming.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, the participants agreed that significant
progress had been made worldwide during the last decade to protect
the ozone layer. But controversy over the threat posed to the ozone
layer by methyl bromide has been growing.</P>
      <P>The participants also agreed to allow more time for the use of
asthma aerosol cans as there is yet no substitute for this form of
the medicine.</P>
      <P>Diminishing the use of CFCs and methyl bromide in Taiwan would
have no major impact on the domestic industrial sector since the
island imports all its methyl bromide, while only the Formosa
Plastics Group, which produces HCFC-22 in its Kaohsiung plants, would
be slightly affected, IDB officials said.</P>
      <P>Under the IDB's programs, new imports of ozone-depleting
substances will be effectively controlled and exports of such
domestically-produced substances will also be managed, the officials
noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN INDEPENDENCE WOULD BRING IMMEDIATE DISASTER: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.   29   (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chang King-yuh, chairman of the
Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), remarked in the
Legislative Yuan plenary session on Tuesday that Taiwan independence
would bring immediate disaster to all the people on the island.</P>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew echoed Chang's view.</P>
      <P>Responding to a suggestion by Yeh Chu-lan, a lawmaker with the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), that the island
declare itself "the Republic of Taiwan," Chang called this
"impossible" and said it would bring "immediate disaster" upon
Taiwan. Although mainland China joined the United Nations in 1971,
Chang continued, the Republic of China still exists in the
international community, and Taipei is furthermore addressing the
improvement of relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Chang also pointed out that the consensus on the nation's
direction painstakingly reached at the National Development
Conference by the ruling party and the DPP can be an asset, both in
dealing with pressure and challenges from Beijing and in engaging the
international community.</P>
      <P>Taipei would like to establish a "step-by-step but without time
schedule" relationship with Beijing based on mutual interests, Chang
noted, adding that as the systems and ways of life on the two sides
become closer, cross-strait peace and stability should improve.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WORLD ALLIANCE TO SAVE SPOONBILLS TO BE ESTABLISHED IN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  29  (CNA)
(By Debbie Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>National Taiwan University (NTU) and the
University of California at Berkeley will inaugurate in Taipei on
Oct. 31 their international alliance to save the blackfaced spoonbill
and its habitat.</P>
      <P>Wildlife conservationists estimated in 1995 that there were only
about 400 blackfaced spoonbills left worldwide.</P>
      <P>Some 300 of these birds migrate every winter from the north to
the wetland at the mouth of Tsengwen Creek in Chiku Village, Tainan,
southern Taiwan, making the place the major habitat of the endangered
species on the globe.</P>
      <P>Dr. Yuan T. Lee, president of the Academia Sinica, Taiwan's top
research institute, will be honorary convenor of the alliance, while
NTU professors Hsia Chu-jeou, Wu You-hua, Lo Shang-lian and Liu
Hsiao-ju will join officials from Berkeley's SAVE (Spoonbill Action
Voluntary Echo) as co-founders.</P>
      <P>According to Hsia, an establishment gala will be held Oct. 31 at
the gate of NTU, highlighted by a simultaneous video conference
between the two universities depicting concerted efforts on behalf of
the spoonbill and calling for suspension of the development of the
Pingnan Industrial Zone near the Chiku wetland.</P>
      <P>As of Oct. 23, more than 100 blackfaced spoonbills had reached
the Chiku wetland for their winter stay.</P>
      <P>Hsia noted that large numbers of other migratory birds, including
many endangered species, begin arriving in late September every year
at Tsengwen Creek, where they remain until March or April.</P>
      <P>To better understand the behavioral patterns and natural habitat
of the blackfaced spoonbill, the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture
(COA) has cooperated with Japanese ornithological societies in using
transmitters to trace their movements.</P>
      <P>COA officials said they have been able to pinpoint the
whereabouts of the usually elusive birds with the help of the
attached transmitters.</P>
      <P>The government will also allocate money in the next fiscal year
to establish a blackfaced spoonbill sanctuary near Chiku, they added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Paraguayan Vice Foreign Minister Leila
Rachid Lichi told local media Tuesday that the Republic of China will
soon send a team of experts to here to inspect the Asuncion
International Airport.</P>
      <P>Rachid said that during her visit to Taiwan Oct. 14-19, ROC
President Lee Teng-hui told her that Taiwan would send a team of
experts in two or three weeks to Paraguay to decide whether to
 supply US$40 million toward the repair and maintenance of the
airport.</P>
      <P>The team will decide whether the aid would be in the form
of loans or donations after the inspection tour, she said.</P>
      <P>Paraguayan Defense Minister Hugo Estigarribia Elizeche announced
in early October that repair and maintenance on the airport could
wait no longer. As the government cannot spare the needed US$40
million, it would ask the ROC for assistance, he said.</P>
      <P>Liu Ting-tzu, ROC ambassador to Paraguay, has already conveyed
the request to the ROC government.</P>
      <P>Estigarribia said the airport is barely usable right now and that
if repair work doesn't begin immediately, international civil
aviation safety authorities may order its closure, given that it
would have to bear additional air traffic if a US airline goes
through with its plan to begin flights to the Paraguayan capital at
the end of the year.</P>
      <P>The airport, about 16 kilometers from downtown Asuncion, was
built 30 years ago. Its sewage system and runways are in poor
condition, and its radar is out of order.</P>
      <P>Safety experts warned Paraguay four years ago to begin repair
work immediately.</P>
      <P>Local civil aviation officials also said that if repairs don't
begin soon, then the airport's condition could endanger the some 800
passengers daily and residents in the surrounding area.</P>
      <P>Paraguay's executive branch did not include a request for airport
repair and maintenance in its most recent budget proposal submitted
to the congress.</P>
      <P>A new radar system and communications equipment, as well as
runway and terminal maintenance, will cost an estimated US$60
million. Paraguay might also ask Spain for assistance.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HU SAYS US  WILL NOT FORCE  TAIWAN  TO NEGOTIATE WITH MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  29 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs Jason Hu said
on Wednesday that although the United States hopes to see the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait enter negotiations, it will not intervene,
nor will it try to force the ROC to negotiate with the mainland.</P>
      <P>Hu made the remarks during a question-and-answer session at the
Legislative Yuan in which Legislator Chien Hsi-chieh voiced concern
that the US may force Taiwan to negotiate with mainland China after
the current meeting between mainland President Jiang Zemin and US
President Bill Clinton.</P>
      <P>He noted that both Beijing and Washington want to extract
something from the Clinton-Jiang meeting. Jiang wants to solidify and
strengthen his leadership stature from his US trip, while Clinton
hopes to reap some substantial gains, but neither side has pinned
much hope on any substantial improvement in bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>Hu said that if relations between the US and the mainland
continue to improve, Taiwan-US relations will be the first to be
affected, which is why Taiwan has repeatedly emphasized to the US
that if it improves relations with the mainland, it is time to also
upgrade its relations with the ROC, adding that Washington-Beijing
relations should run parallel to Washington-Taipei ties.</P>
      <P>But he said the effect of improved Washington-Beijing relations
-- whether it will tempt Beijing to adopt a tougher or more moderate
stance toward Taipei, or whether the emergent power of the mainland
will prompt it to step up its campaign to isolate Taiwan
internationally -- remains to be seen.</P>
      <P>However, he also said that the meeting is not expected to result
in a substantial improved Washington-Beijing relationship, because
the differences between the two sides are far greater than the points
on which they agree.</P>
      <P>He said the ROC has yet to see anything likely to undermine ROC
interests in the Clinton-Jiang meeting, and that the ROC will
continue its communications with the US in every respect, from the
Congress to the Executive branch, the academic as well the private
sector, so that the ROC will have other mechanisms in place to
prevent the US executive branch from endangering the ROC's interests.</P>
      <P>Hu also said that the US will continue its policy of helping
Taiwan to join international organizations, adding that the US has
expressed support for Taiwan's entry to some organizations it is
considering joining. He didn't elaborate.</P>
      <P>The foreign minister said that Richard Bush, chairman of the
American Institute in Taiwan, will come to Taiwan right after the
Clinton-Jiang meeting, his first visit to the ROC since assuming the
AIT chairmanship earlier this year, when he will answer concerns
regarding Taipei-Washington relations.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui said on Wednesday
that the government has taken appropriate action to deal with the
recent fluctuation in Taiwan stocks and currency, but he also urged
officials to make further studies of measures to stabilize the
financial market.</P>
      <P>The plunge of the Taiwan stock exchange on Tuesday, in which the
weighted index, the market's key barometer, fell over 400 points,
became the focus of heated debate in the regular Kuomintang Central
Standing Committee meeting on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>C.F. Koo, a business tycoon and KMT standing committee member,
appealed in the meeting for the government to pay close attention to
the storm in the local bourse, but to respect the market mechanism
when handling fluctuations in the stock market.</P>
      <P>Wang You-cheng, another KMT standing committee member and
chairman of the General Chamber of Commerce of the Republic of China,
said that the government has persuaded business leaders to intervene
in the stock market to prop up share prices, but that in the longer
term, it should use the stock stabilization fund to solve the stock
crisis.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Vice Finance Minister Wu Chia-sheng categorically
denied reports that his ministry is considering cutting the stock
transaction tax in order to salvage the sluggish stock prices,
stressing that the ministry has never considered such a proposal.</P>
      <P>He was responding to reports that due to the consecutive daily
slide of the Taiwan stock market, the government will consider
cutting the stock transaction tax for those who hold on to their
stocks for a long period of time.</P>
      <P>He also denied rumors that the stock stabilization fund, which
was set up early last year when mainland China carried out missile
tests in waters near Taiwan in the runup to Taiwan's presidential
election, had been used to intervene in the stock market, adding that
the fund is only a temporary measure.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  29  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan posted a trade surplus of US$10.4
billion with mainland China in the first eight months of this year,
making the mainland Taiwan's largest source of trade surplus, the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>MOEA statistics show that Taiwan exports to mainland China in the
first eight months of the year grew by 6.3 percent, up 3.1 percent
from the same period of last year.</P>
      <P>Chang Yao-tsung, director general of the Statistics Department
under the MOEA, said trade activities between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait should be mutually beneficial, as trade dependence on
each other has greatly increased. Political and economic
uncertainties in mainland China will also hurt Taiwan's economy, he
noted, adding that the two sides should cooperate positively.</P>
      <P>While briefing Economic Affairs Minister Wang Chih-kang on
Taiwan's recent economic situation, Chang said the recent plummet of
the local bourse is a consequence of both the worldwide financial
turmoil originating in Southeast Asia and the lack of investor
confidence, which totally contradicts Taiwan's brilliant economic
performance.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, Taiwan's industrial production has posted
increases for the last fifteen consecutive months. The average
industrial production index in the first three quarters of the year
was up 6.6 percent from the same period of the previous year. During
the same period, the manufacturing sector enjoyed a 7.7 percent
growth rate, faster than the average for the past five years.</P>
      <P>In addition, exports set a record single-month high of US$10.8
billion in September, up 10.7 percent from the corresponding month in
1996, with foreign orders worth nearly the same amount, also a record
high, placed with Taiwan manufacturers in September.</P>
      <P>Chang forecast that Taiwan's exports of high-tech products to
Southeast Asian countries may expand in the months ahead, while more
traditional exports may be affected by the recent depreciation of
currencies in Southeast Asian nations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>STUDY SAYS OFFICIALS ROUTINELY USE TORTURE IN TIBET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  28 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A study completed by the Boston-based
Physicians for Human Rights shows that communist Chinese authorities
continue to routinely use torture as a means of political repression,
punishment and intimidation in Tibet.</P>
      <P>Allen Keller, a professor at New York University School of
Medicine and a member of the International Advisory Board of
Physicians for Human Rights, revealed the findings of the study
Tuesday when he testified at a hearing before the House Subcommittee
on International Organizations and Human Rights.</P>
      <P>The new study substantiated the finding of a similar study by the
organization in 1989 that under communist Chinese rule, torture of
Tibetan political prisoners was routine.</P>
      <P>The 1997 study includes a survey of 258 Tibetan refugees and
extensive medical examinations of those Tibetans who indicated that
they had been tortured. It was found that detainees in Tibet are
subject to repeated episodes and multiple forms of torture.</P>
      <P>Commonly reported forms of torture include beatings, electrical
shocks, being suspended or restrained in painful positions,
witnessing others being tortured, burned with cigarettes or other hot
objects, exposure to extreme temperatures, being forced to stare at
the sun, sleep deprivation, mock execution, and having blood drawn
against the individual's will.</P>
      <P>Keller said Physicians for Human Rights cannot say whether the
Clinton administration's "constructive engagement" policy toward
Beijing is the reason for the poor human rights situation in Tibet
but that the organization certainly joins other human rights group in
observing that the policy does not appear to be working.</P>
      <P>"PHR strongly urges the administration to reestablish human
rights linkage to those things that China most desires: a state visit
by the president of the United States, permission to import high
technology American goods and admittance into the World Trade
Organization," he said.</P>
      <P>Keller urged Beijing to take the following actions:</P>
      <P>-- Permit access to all places of detention in Tibet to the
International Committee of the Red Cross and the United Nations
Special Rapporteur on Torture;</P>
      <P>-- End the process of incommunicado detention of all detainees
and permit immediate access by lawyers and family members of those
detained;</P>
      <P>-- End the vilification campaign against the Dalai Lama and the
abuses associated with it, including political re-education at
monasteries and other means of control; and</P>
      <P>-- Release all those detained as prisoners of conscience.

    <HEADLINE>JIANG SNUBBED BY VIRGINIA'S GOVERNOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct. 28 (CNA)
(By Bill Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin
was snubbed Tuesday by Virginia's governor, George Allen, who backed
out of a formal luncheon in Jiang's honor and, instead, sent his wife
to deliver a pointed statement reminding the mainland leader of the
"universal human principles" of freedom, liberty and representative
democracy.</P>
      <P>Allen, who just returned from a visit to Taiwan on Oct. 11-13,
was originally to host the luncheon in Williamsburg, a replica of
pre-revolutionary America, before Jiang's state visit to Washington.</P>
      <P>Instead, a spokesman told CNA, Allen decided Friday to accept an
invitation to campaign for the Republican candidate for governor, Jim
Gilmore, who is leading his Democratic opponent, Don Beyer, in the
Nov. 4 election by a comfortable margin of seven percentage points
according to a recent opinion poll.</P>
      <P>The governor said in a statement read by his wife, "Virginia is
the birthplace of American freedom -- where the seeds of individual
liberty, self-government and free enterprise were planted, took root
and have yielded an abundant harvest -- one of the most uplifting and
successful influences in the history of mankind."</P>
      <P>Noting that Thomas Jefferson, the second governor of Virginia,
was the author of the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom and the
Declaration of Independence, Allen said that Virginia is proud that
one of its sons wrote words that are "universal" in their meaning for
all people declaring that "all men are endowed by their Creator with
certain unalienable rights ... of life, liberty and the pursuit of
happiness" and that governments "derive their just powers from the
consent of the governed."</P>
      <P>The governor said that Williamsburg offers a unique insight into
America's courageous and spirited beginning in Virginia. "May this
treasured setting provide you with a greater understanding of, and
appreciation for, the universal human principles upon which America
is built -- freedom ..., liberty ... and representative democracy."</P>
      <P>Allen's repeated emphasis on the word "universal" is an apparent
rebuttal of Jiang's claim that human rights is a relative term, and
that mainland China should be judged by a different set of standards.</P>
      <P>"I believe the most important, the most fundamental human right
is how to ensure that the 1.2 billion Chinese people have adequate
food and clothing," Jiang told US journalists before embarking on the
visit.</P>
      <P>Jiang has said he hopes that his current visit will enhance the
understanding, broaden common ground and deepen cooperation between
mainland China and the United States.</P>
      <P>Jiang and his wife were greeted by a red-coated fife-and-drum
corps upon their visit to the Governor's Palace at the tourist
village. Jiang put on a black three-cornered hat from the colonial
era, emulating the late Deng Xiaoping who captured the American
people's imagination by donning a cowboy hat in Houston during his
1979 US visit.</P>
      <P>Some 100 demonstrators were kept 250 yards from the building.
They held placards demanding human rights in mainland China, freedom
for Tibet and revocation of mainland China's most favored nation
trading status.</P>
      <P>Jiang and his entourage later flew into Andrews Air Force Base in
suburban Washington, where they were greeted by Vice President Al
Gore. Clinton arranged a private meeting with Jiang Tuesday night in
the White House to ease the way for Wednesday's summit.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING URGED TO RELEASE ABDUCTED MARINE POLICE OFFICER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  29  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>ROC Interior Minister Yeh Chin-feng on
Wednesday again urged mainland China to repatriate a Taiwan marine
police officer who was abducted by mainland Chinese fishermen earlier
this month while he was conducting a search of a mainland fishing
vessel intercepted in Taiwan territorial waters off the island of
Matsu, which is controlled by the Republic of China but located close
to the mainland.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at a Legislative Yuan committee meeting, Yeh
denied that the ROC government has agreed to foot the medical bills
of mainland fishermen who allegedly were injured by Taiwan marine
police in the Oct. 11 clash.</P>
      <P>Yeh said the National Police Administration, which is under the
jurisdiction of the Interior Ministry, has asked the cabinet-level
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) and the semi-official Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) to negotiate with mainland authorities for the early
return of Chuang Chen-yao, the abducted officer.</P>
      <P>Yeh quoted a police investigation report as showing that the
mainland fishing boat was caught operating in Taiwan waters on Oct.
11, "so it was appropriate and necessary that our marine police
patrol boat intercepted and boarded the intruding mainland fishing
vessel to conduct routine checks."</P>
      <P>Yeh said that although the marine police officers carry powerful
firearms, they didn't open fire, in an effort to avoid escalating
tension across the Taiwan Strait. "Their self-restraint deserves
praise," the minister noted.</P>
      <P>She expressed regret that no officer from the Matsu Garrison
Command was in command of the marine police vessel at the time of the
confrontation, saying that according to government regulations, the
military's Matsu Garrison Command is responsible for patrolling the
waters surrounding Matsu, while the marine police are only required
to play a supporting or auxiliary role.</P>
      <P>Yeh admitted that the inexperience of the marine police Matsu
division chief, who assumed his post only recently, was also a
factor contributing to the failure of the operation.</P>
      <P>The officers failed to take preemptive action to control the
situation after they boarded the mainland fishing boat. As a result,

    <HEADLINE>APEC MEETING TO ADDRESS ASIAN CURRENCY CRISIS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Oct.  28  (CNA)
(By S.C. CHANG)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Asia's currency crisis, which has been
blamed for causing global stock turmoil, will be among the topics
discussed by the 18 leaders of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) countries, a ranking Canadian official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The agenda of next month's APEC summit in Vancouver will have to
be reorganized to deal with the issue, Canada's Trade Minister Sergio
Marchi said.</P>
      <P>The host country noted that the entire agenda of the APEC
countries can't be scrapped because of all the work that has been
going on throughout the year. Canada, as APEC's 1997 host, has held
four ministerial meetings before the Nov. 24-25 summit.</P>
      <P>"Clearly I think the leaders will be engaged on the currency
issue," he said. "And I've talked about putting in place a process by
which that discussion can take place."</P>
      <P>Marchi made the comments as the Canadian dollar showed signs of
resistance to the panic selling that started Monday with the collapse
of equity markets worldwide.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, rumors were circulating that some Asian countries like
Thailand and Indonesia will be looking for a rescue package from the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the larger industrialized
countries, much like Mexico got in 1995 to shore up its currency.</P>
      <P>Stanley Fisher, first deputy managing director of the IMF, said
in Washington the organization is ready to help countries hit by
market turbulence and is in talks with nations in Asia and Latin
America.</P>
      <P>Marchi, when asked about such aid, was non-committal. "I think it
would be premature right now to advocate what is good and what is
bad," he said.</P>
      <P>"I would be more keenly interested in making sure we've got a
process by which these and other alternatives can be housed and
discussed and aired properly."</P>
      <P>The proposal for an "Asia Stability Fund" has met with opposing
voices on the grounds that it would duplicate the functions of the
IMF.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA  WANTS  MAINLAND  CHINA  TO SIGN HUMAN RIGHTS COVENANT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct.  29 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia has welcomed mainland China's
signature on the International Covenant on Economic, Social and
Cultural Rights (ICESCR) and wants Beijing to move a step forward by
signing the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
(ICCPR), Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In a statement faxed to the CNA, Downer said: "Australia hopes
that China will also consider early ratification of the ICCPR, which
would complement ratification of the ICESCR and significantly
strengthen international support for the International Bill of
Rights."</P>
      <P>He said Australia welcomes mainland China's signature in New York
on Tuesday of the ICESCR because the covenant "is a central element
of the international human rights legal framework, and China's
accession to it will give a significant boost to the objective of
promoting universal adherence to the rights set out in the covenant."</P>
      <P>Political analysts said mainland China still has a long way to go
to improve its human rights record, despite its signing of the
covenant.</P>
      <P>"So long as political prisoners and dissidents are in jail,
Australia, as a democratic country, will express its concern and
raise the issue with mainland China," one analyst said.</P>
      <P>The analysts said mainland China will remain under international
pressure because it has no political freedom, freedom of speech or
freedom of religion, and the abuse of human rights in Tibet is
serious.</P>
      <P>The year 1998 marks the 50th anniversary of the UN General
Assembly's adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
which, together with the International Covenant on Economic, Social
and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights, comprise the International Bill of Rights -- the
foundation on which the international human rights legal framework is
built.</P>

      <P>The Australian stock market, buoyed by
Tuesday's Wall Street rebound, itself rebounded strongly in early
morning trading on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The All Ordinaries Index on Tuesday plunged 177.8 points, or 7.2
percent, as world markets crashed after Wall Street recorded its
largest-ever one-day fall.</P>
      <P>Tuesday's plunge, the biggest one-day decline since the market
crash of 1987, saw A$27.4 billion wiped off in Australia.</P>
      <P>But the index rebounded strongly in the first hour of morning
trading on Wednesday, rising 167 points to about 2,466 after plunging
to 2299.2 at Tuesday's close.</P>
      <P>The Australian dollar rebounded on Tuesday, rising to 69.41 US
cents from Monday's closing level of 68.50 US cents, and continued
its gain on Wednesday, jumping to 70.70 US cents.</P>
      <P>Brokers and dealers believe that if Wall Street continues its
bullish run in the coming days or weeks, the Australian stock market
and foreign exchange market will follow suit.</P>
      <P>"We hope there is a silver lining coming out from the big black
clouds of the past few weeks," one broker said, adding that the
recent plunge in the Australian stock market might reduce the
government's income from its floating of telecommunications giant,
Telstra, to only A$12 billion, down from the original target of
A$14.2 billion.</P>
      <P>The floating of government-owned Telstra, the biggest in

    <HEADLINE>JAKARTA WANTS CURRENCY EARLY WARNING SYSTEM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Oct.  29 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Indonesian President Suharto will seek
support at next month's APEC summit for urgent action to check the
regional currency turmoil which has spread around the world, said his
special adviser Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Professor Bintoro Tjokronamidjojo, Indonesia's ambassador for
APEC affairs, said Suharto would propose the setting up of an early
warning system to avert a future currency crisis and a standby
emergency fund to help troubled economies recover from their
financial problems.</P>
      <P>"The currency crisis in Southeast Asia is a common concern which
needs concerted efforts by APEC leaders," he was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>Bintoro was in Singapore to attend a two-day APEC Senior
Officials' Meeting which ended Tuesday. He said the standby fund
Indonesia would propose to the APEC summit next month in Vancouver
would supplement the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and provide
short-term reserves for members hit by currency turbulence.</P>
      <P>Contributions to the fund should come from APEC member-economies
as a reflection of solidarity, he said, noting that Singapore and
Malaysia had pledged financial assistance to help Indonesia weather
its economic crisis. The IMF is finalizing an aid package for
Indonesia.</P>
      <P>Elaborating on the early warning system, he said it could help
flash warning signals to APEC economies heading for financial
troubles before the situation becomes a full-blown crisis.</P>
      <P>"The warning bells should be sounded when a country's
fundamentals are not right, such as when its current account deficits
and short-term lending get too high. Such a mechanism will help avert
a crisis," he said, adding that it would also sustain stability in
the financial markets by preventing excessive fluctuation of
currencies.</P>
      <P>Bintoro acknowledged that Southeast Asian countries ravaged by
the currency debacle must take immediate steps to reform their
financial and trade sectors.</P>
      <P>For Indonesia, he said the current economic crisis "is a blessing
in disguise as we know our weaknesses now."</P>
      <P>But he remained optimistic about the region's continued growth
prospects.</P>
      <P>Reflecting the urgency to take collective action to stabilize the
financial markets in Asia, APEC's deputy finance ministers and
central bankers will gather in Manila Nov. 19-20 to put up a rescue
package for consideration by the APEC leaders at their Nov. 25
summit, APEC officials said.</P>
      <P>The currency crisis is likely to dominate the leaders'
discussions although APEC officials said they did not expect any
immediate concrete measures to come out of the summit.</P>

      <P>Foreign Minister Jason Hu said on Wednesday
that the US stance on the Taiwan independence issue is that the US
"doesn't support" Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>A local newspaper reported on Wednesday that during talks between

Qian that the US "was opposed to" Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>The China Times said that in the past, the US has always used the
phrase "does not support" to describe their stance, instead of "is
opposed to," adding that Beijing is urging Washington to state
clearly that "the US is opposed to Taiwan independence and Taiwan's
admission to the United Nations" in a joint declaration to be issued
following the summit talks between US president Bill Clinton and
mainland China's President Jiang Zemin.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  29  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The following are excerpts from an
editorial carried in Wednesday's edition of local English-language
daily The China Post, titled: "Investors Need to Remain Calm During
Turmoil."</P>
      <P>"Under the influence of the world financial market turmoil, the
Taiwan Stock Exchange yesterday (Tuesday) tumbled as much as 5.93
percent to close at 7,210 points, the largest single day fall in the
bourse's recent history. The foreign exchange market, too, underwent
a large decline, as the New Taiwan dollar was down 38 U.S. cents to
30.8 against the U.S. dollar at the close of the morning session.</P>
      <P>"Yesterday's (Tuesday's) see-offs on both the local stock and
forex markets were sparked by news that the Dow Jones industrial
average of the United States in the preceding day plummeted an
astonishing 554 points...</P>
      <P>"The Dow's own historical crash...was triggered by a continuous
plunge of the Hong Kong stock market.</P>
      <P>"The chain-reaction volatility in the world's stock and currency
markets...has once again demonstrated how one country or one region's
financial woes can quickly affect other markets with the increase of
globalization.</P>
      <P>"The problem now faced by us in Taiwan is...how to overcome the
psychological impact those foreign markets may have on local
investors and traders, should the transactions in those countries
remain volatile.</P>
      <P>"To maintain the stability of the financial markets, the most
important thing is to first stabilize the exchange rate of the NT
dollar.... Over the past three months, the Central Bank of China
(CBC) took strong measures to defend the NT dollar by continuing to
sell foreign exchange in the market. But the CBC finally...had to
succumb to mounting depreciatory pressure to let the local currency
determine its own value in the marketplace.</P>
      <P>"The policy change of the CBC's was right. This is because
central bank intervention can only help raise market expectations at
a time when the financial markets around the world continue to
undergo wild fluctuations and investor confidence is fragile.</P>
      <P>"All this, however, is not to say that the CBC must stand by idly
if and when speculation becomes rampant.</P>
      <P>"In response to the plunge of the local stock market yesterday,
the Ministry of Finance...held a special meeting...to discuss
market-boosting measures.</P>
      <P>"One important thing that the government can and should do at
this point is to urge investors to remain calm and not to engage in
panic selling."</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Finance (MOF) on Wednesday
flatly stated that it will not reduce or cancel the stock transaction
tax for the sake of stabilizing Taiwan's stock market.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Stock Exchange on Wednesday experienced a continued
decline in the weighted index, the key barometer of the local bourse,
despite a rebound in share prices on the New York Stock Exchange
which triggered a recovery in major markets around the world.</P>
      <P>Concerned over the local market's decline, legislators had
suggested either canceling or reducing the transaction tax as an
incentive to encourage stock investors to hold on to their shares for
a longer period of time.</P>
      <P>However, MOF Vice Minister Yen Ching-chang indicated that
adjusting or canceling the stock trading tax outright is not "a
panacea for stabilizing the bourse."</P>
      <P>Yen claimed that the current 0.3 percent taxation on share
trading activities does not constitute a burden to investors.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the MOF also declared that there is no need to
implement an automatic mechanism for suspending trade on the local
bourse, such as that set up in the United States following the stock
market crash of October, 1987. The ministry added that the existing 7
percent ceiling on the rise and fall of share prices which is
currently in use has the same stabilizing effect as the US system.</P>

      <P>The Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) on
Wednesday urged mainland Chinese authorities to repatriate a Taiwan
marine policeman who was abducted to the other side of the Taiwan
Strait on Oct. 11, adding that there will be no compensation to
mainland fishermen involved in the case.</P>
      <P>The SEF said in a news release that it is greatly concerned over
recent remarks made by Tang Shubei, vice chairman of Beijing's
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS). Tang said
that the abducted officer, Chuang Cheng-yo, is in good condition and
that he will be allowed to return to Taiwan once he reaches an
agreement over compensation with two mainland fishermen who sustained
injuries in a scuffle involving Chuang and another marine police.</P>
      <P>The two Taiwan marine police officers boarded a mainland fishing
boat they suspected of smuggling goods into Taiwan during a routine
patrol in waters near the offshore island of Matsu on Oct. 11.
Overcome in the ensuing scuffle, Chuang, who received an injury to
his arm, was taken to the Fujian Province port city of Fuzhou by
mainland fishermen. Several of the fishermen also reportedly suffered
injuries during the incident.</P>
      <P>SEF officials said that Chuang has no liability to compensate the
injured mainland fishermen, claiming that they are to blame for the
incident because they were trespassing in Taiwan's territorial waters
and had attempted to hinder Chuang in his search of the fishing boat.</P>
      <P>The SEF added, however, that in consideration of the fraternal
bonds between people on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, Taiwan
authorities are willing to offer condolence money to the injured
fishermen. But the gesture of condolence and the return of Chuang are
two different matters, it said, adding that mainland officials should
not link them and should release the officer at an early date.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SUSPECTS IN PLASTIC SURGERY CLINIC MURDER REMAIN UNIDENTIFIED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  29  (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A high-ranking police official said
Wednesday that two at-large suspects in the kidnap and murder of a
high school student might have also committed the brutal murder of
three victims at a plastic surgery clinic in Taipei.</P>
      <P>However, Ting Yuan-ching, director-general of the National Police
Administration, denied a newspaper report that police had obtained
sufficient evidence to conclude that Kao Tien-ming and Chen
Ching-hsing were responsible for killing plastic surgeon Fen Pao-fan,
his wife and a nurse on Oct. 23. The pair are currently wanted for
the abduction and murder of the teenage daughter of well-known TV
entertainer Pai Ping-ping in May.</P>
      <P>Ting said that blood samples collected at the scene, which was
believed to belong to the suspects, was analyzed to be type B and a
sperm sample gathered from the body of the nurse indicated a type A
origin. Although Kao Tien-ming's blood type is "B" and Chen
Ching-hsing's is "A," the evidence is insufficient to prove that they
or anyone else is responsible for the criminal act, Ting said.</P>
      <P>Responding to questions from legislators at the Legislative Yuan,
Ting said that the most reliable and scientific method of identifying
the suspects is through DNA analysis. But Ting also noted that the
police do not have either Kao's or Chen's DNA profiles.</P>
      <P>Prosecutor Liu Ching-wang said that, within legal limits, law
enforcement officials will attempt to obtain blood samples from the
parents of the two fugitives in an attempt to construct DNA profiles.
But she refused to confirm whether investigators have already
obtained such samples or whether DNA testing is under way.</P>
      <P>Liu said that she does not rule out the possibility that the
three people murdered in the clinic were killed after Kao had
undergone plastic surgery on his eyebrows to change his appearance.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC CALLS FOR IMMEDIATE RESUMPTION OF 'KOO-WANG' TALKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  30 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In a formal response to the conclusion of
the high-profile Clinton-Jiang talks, the Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) again held out an olive branch to Beijing on Thursday, urging
it to resume dialogue with Taipei immediately and unconditionally.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level agency, which charts Taiwan's policy toward
mainland China, said the Republic of China's stance on the Oct. 29
summit meeting between US President Bill Clinton and his mainland
counterpart, Jiang Zemin, is crystal clear in maintaining that their
talks should not impinge the ROC's national interests.</P>
      <P>The agency also said in a press release that the United States
should upgrade its relations with Taipei in a manner parallel to the
improvement in its ties with Beijing in the wake of the Clinton-Jiang
summit.</P>
      <P>To cope with the post-summit situation, the MAC said, the ROC
government will seek to reinforce high-level security dialogue and
exchanges with the US administration and simultaneously take active
steps to break the current cross-strait impasse and establish a
mechanism for positive bilateral interaction.</P>
      <P>In fact, the MAC said, the ROC has always kept its doors open for
cross-strait consultations. "Exchanges and consultations have been
the two key elements in the implementation of our mainland policy,"
it noted.</P>
      <P>The MAC further said Taiwan's promotion of cross-strait dialogue
and political consultations are aimed at creating a peaceful
atmosphere, stabilizing bilateral relations and safeguarding security
in the Taiwan Strait. "So our mainland policy goals fully comply with
the US position on maintaining peace and stability in the
Asia-Pacific region," the agency explained.</P>
      <P>It pointed out that the greatest obstacle to cross-strait
relations lies in Beijing's recalcitrant "one China" sovereign
concept and its reluctance to face up to the reality that the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait are currently under separate rule.</P>
      <P>Touching on future cross-strait relations, the MAC said the ROC's
consistent stance is that the two sides immediately resume the
"Koo-Wang" talks and all institutionalized communications channels
without setting any preconditions.</P>
      <P>It added that preliminary consultations for an end to
cross-strait hostility can also be discussed in the Koo-Wang
framework.</P>
      <P>The Koo-Wang talks refer to a meeting held in Singapore in April
1993 between C.F. Koo, chairman of the Taipei-based Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF), and Wang Daohan, chairman of the Beijing-based
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS). It marked
the highest-level cross-strait talks since the Chinese Communists
took control of the mainland.</P>
      <P>The top negotiators from both sides were originally scheduled to
meet again in the second half of 1995, but mainland China
unilaterally suspended the conference and closed all other dialogue
channels formulated in the first Koo-Wang meeting to vent its anger
at ROC President Lee Teng-hui's landmark private visit to the US in
June that year.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are semi-official intermediary bodies founded
by their respective governments to handle cross-strait exchanges in
the absence of official ties.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC, NEW ZEALAND SIGN WTO ACCORD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 30 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China on Thursday formally
signed an agreement with New Zealand on the terms for Taiwan to join
the World Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>The accord was inked in Taipei by Chen Jui-lung, director-general
of the ROC's Board of Foreign Trade, and Alastair Bisley, deputy
secretary of the New Zealand's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade.</P>
      <P>New Zealand is the 16th WTO member to seal a formal pact on
Taiwan's accession terms.</P>
      <P>Bisley said New Zealand is satisfied with the conclusion of WTO
talks with Taiwan. "We also hope that your country will finalize all
bilateral and multilateral consultations and enter the world trade
regulatory body as early as possible," he told a news conference held
at the end of the two-day ROC-New Zealand trade consultations.</P>
      <P>For his part, Chen said the signing of the ROC-New Zealand WTO
agreement marks a big step forward in Taiwan's bid to join the
Geneva-based world trade body.</P>
      <P>To date, Chen said, the ROC has completed bilateral talks with 21
of the 26 WTO members who expressed intentions to hold such
consultations, and has even sealed formal pacts with 16 of them.</P>
      <P>The five trade partners with which the ROC has yet to finalize
WTO talks are the United States, Canada, Switzerland, Singapore and
the 15-member European Union. Chen said only a few issues remain to
be resolved with those major partners.</P>
      <P>Five other WTO members -- Hong Kong, Thailand, Mexico, Hungary
and Argentina -- have completed consultations with the ROC, but have
yet to sign a formal accord.</P>
      <P>Chen said the Oct. 27-28 round of talks with Singapore has
achieved concrete results. Singapore originally demanded that Taiwan
cut tariffs on 40 kinds of industrial products, but the number has
been trimmed to 17 following the latest round of negotiations. Chen
said Economics Minister Wang Chih-kang will further discuss the issue
with his Singaporean counterpart when he attends the annual
ministerial meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in
Canada next month.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the just-concluded summit meeting between US
President Bill Clinton and mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin
would enable mainland China to join the WTO ahead of Taiwan, Chen
said Taiwan leads the mainland in WTO talks at the moment and that
Taiwan's trade regime is far more compliant with WTO requirements
than is the mainland's.</P>
      <P>In addition to WTO-related issues, Chen said Taiwan and New
Zealand have also reached consensus on eight other topics, including
protection of intellectual property rights (IPR), tourism cooperation
and avoidance of double taxation on investors from both sides.</P>
      <P>Chen said the two countries will sign a tax exemption accord once
New Zealand's parliament passes the Taiwan-drafted pact.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen said, Taiwan and New Zealand are scheduled to
sign an IPR protection accord before the end of this year. The ROC's
Fair Trade Commission is discussing fair trade rules with relevant
New Zealand authorities as well as ways to promote cooperation among
small- and medium-sized enterprises.</P>
      <P>Chen said New Zealand has promised to offer three-year
multiple-entry business and tourist visas to Taiwan visitors in the
near future. The two sides will also reinforce cooperation in
research on energy resources, fishing resources conservation, and
plant and animal quarantine.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LAWMAKERS FEAR TAIWAN'S BARGAINING POSITION IS WANING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 30 (CNA)
(By Debbie Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Worried over a possible strategic alliance
between the United States and mainland China in the wake of the
Clinton-Jiang summit, several legislators said on Thursday that
Taiwan's bargaining chips are diminishing and its clout in the
international community is waning.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chen Chi-mai from the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) said during a national affairs forum at the
Legislative Yuan that the three-way relations among Taiwan, the
United States and mainland China have become increasingly problematic
following the Clinton-Jiang meeting.</P>
      <P>Chen said Washington, with the encouragement of Beijing, may
inadvertently "sell out" Taiwan over business interests which include
the prospect for mainland orders of Boeing aircraft and nuclear
facilities, serving up the island as "fish and meat," with the
Americans and mainland Chinese supplying the "knife and chopping
board."</P>
      <P>Cheng Pao-ching, another DPP legislator, said he worries that
Taiwan will be eventually sacrificed in the manner of a "second Yalta
agreement." Claiming that Taiwan's ordeal has just begun, Cheng
stressed that the government should make its voice louder to let the
international community know that both Taiwan and mainland China are
sovereign political entities.</P>
      <P>The Yalta Conference, among Allied leaders Roosevelt, Churchill
and Stalin on Feb. 4, 1945, resulted in the Soviet occupation of
disputed border areas with China and the capture by the Chinese
Communists of weaponry and military equipment left by the Japanese in
Manchuria. Those developments are said to have contributed to the
eventual defeat of the ROC Nationalist forces when China's civil war
began in earnest in 1948.</P>
      <P>New Party Legislator Hau Lung-ping, meanwhile, said it is clear
that relations among Taiwan, the United States and mainland China are
triangular in nature, but that the sides of the triangle are not of
equal proportion. Taiwan's position is apparently much weaker than
that of Washington and Beijing, which now seem on equitable footing,
he noted.</P>
      <P>Hau suggested that Taiwan begin talks on the "three links" and
other business and trade issues with the mainland under the "one
China" principle without further delay.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan continues to refuse discussion on the three
links--direct trade, postal and transport contact with the
mainland--the island will soon lose its bargaining chips, which will
ultimately victimize all 21.3 million Taiwan residents, he
states.</P>
      <P>Another New Party legislator, Chen I-hsin, said the ROC
government should assert more clearly its adherence to the "one
China" principle and its position that Taiwan is a part of China.
However, he noted, the "China" to which the ROC refers is by no means
the People's Republic of China.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>In an article published by The Wall
Street Journal Wednesday, Chai Ling, a leader of the 1989 student
demonstrations in Tiananmen Square, expressed her hope that America's
leaders will not back down in confronting mainland Chinese President
Jiang Zemin on subjects like human rights and political freedom.</P>
      <P>Now a MBA student at Harvard Business School, Chai said in the
article, titled "China: No Food Without Freedom," that Americans need
to recognize their fears of mainland China are overblown. "The Chinese
government needs US support just as much as the US needs China, if
not more. China needs the American market, technology and exports
just as much as the US needs access to China's market. President
Jiang needs American support to further consolidate his power back
home."</P>
      <P>America should firmly and forcefully communicate its values and
basic respect for human rights," she wrote. "Those who believe in
waiting for the free market to bring about freedom in China are
mistaken."</P>
      <P>The best way to promote mainland China's prosperity and the
prosperity of the firms doing business there is to push for greater
freedom and human rights, Chai said, adding, "China is enjoying
today's prosperity despite, not because of, its form of government."</P>
      <P>The functioning of a free market requires a society that allows
and respects the freedom of its own people, she wrote, "and a free
society requires the release of political prisoners, including
well-known freedom fighters like Wei Jingsheng and Wang Dan, as well
as thousands of anonymous victims who are still held in prison camps
across the country."</P>
      <P>Concluding the article, Chai said the United States "can play an
instrumental role in mainland China's transition to a free society and
thereby help China improve its economic growth and prosperity."</P>

    <HEADLINE>JAPAN SEEN FACING 'WORLD-CLASS CRISIS'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,   Oct.   30  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Japan is a country particularly
vulnerable to an acute financial crisis because of inherent problems
in its banking system, according to a leading authority on
international finance.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the Australian Financial Review in Sydney,
Dr. Morris Goldstein of the Institute for International Economics in
Washington, DC, said problems with financial systems are "fairly
widespread" among the major economies of Northeast Asia -- Japan,
South Korea and mainland China.</P>
      <P>"But if you look at where systematic risk is largest, it's in
Japan -- there's no doubt about it, because it comes on top of other
things that have happened there," he said.</P>
      <P>He said Japan's banking system had been in a slow-motion crisis
for five years, with the economy stagnant, too. But Japanese
authorities have failed to act decisively to address the country's
problems, said Goldstein, former deputy head of research for the
International Monetary Fund.</P>
      <P>He said Japan was set for "a truly world-class banking crisis."
So far three Japanese banks have collapsed.</P>
      <P>"Another two or three banks will collapse this fiscal year to the
end of next March and the Deposit Insurance Corporation is supposed
to support them, but they have no funds left," Goldstein said.</P>
      <P>"The problem has become so big that it is politically impossible
to use public funds to rescue them," he said.</P>
      <P>He said the economic crisis in Asia is unusual because it is
moving from small countries like Thailand to bigger ones. Financial
crises typically begin in a major economy and then infect smaller
ones, he said.</P>
      <P>He said the Japanese banking system will be further damaged by
the crisis which started in Thailand, whose economy is only half the
size of Australia's, because Japanese commercial banks have US$150
billion in exposures to Asian countries.</P>
      <P>"Japan has been able to put off adjustment because it has deep
pockets, but putting it on the back burner is very costly -- if you
don't deal with it just gets worse," he said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Singapore, Oct. 30 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore households are going upmarket,
with more of them owning cellular phones, personal computers, video
cameras, laser disc players and other consumer appliances.</P>
      <P>One in three households now owns at least one cellular phone, a
fivefold increase since 1992.</P>
      <P>Households owning PCs, laser disc players and video cameras have
doubled, while car ownership has risen only slightly, with one in
three households owning cars.</P>
      <P>About half of all Singaporean households are now air-conditioned,
up from only 35 percent in 1992.</P>
      <P>These were the preliminary findings of the seventh Household
Expenditure Survey carried out earlier this year by the Singapore
Department of Statistics in conjunction with the Ministry of Labor.</P>
      <P>The department will conduct a more in-depth survey from next
month until next October to re-evaluate the basket of goods in the
Consumer Price Index.</P>
      <P>Over the next 12 months, the department will conduct personal
interviews with some 9,000 selected households to collect detailed
information on all sources of income, asset ownership, investments,
as well as expenditure on consumer durables, travel and housing.
Foreign households in Singapore were excluded.</P>
      <P>Selected Singapore households were picked based on sampling rules
set by the department to ensure that survey results reflect
population and geographical differences.</P>
      <P>They will be divided into 26 groups of about 340 households, with
each group monitoring its expenditures over a two-week period.</P>
      <P>The results from the 1992-93 survey showed that the proportion of
household income spent on food had declined by 10 percent as people
spent more on increasing transport and housing costs, the department
said.</P>
      <P>It expects this trend to continue in the next survey.</P>
      <P>The change in the pattern of consumption shows a clear change in
the lifestyle patterns of Singaporeans and the standard of living
here, it added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>M'LAND CHINA DESCRIBED AS A STUMBLING GIANT IN NEED OF HELP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct. 30 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The current economic crisis in East Asia
is minuscule compared with the mounting debt and widespread
corruption problems in mainland China and Jiang Zemin is a weak leader
of a nation in deep crisis.</P>
      <P>So claims a dispatch from Beijing appearing in Thursday's Sydney
Morning Herald. The mass-circulation daily's correspondent David
Lague reported that Jiang is expected to exploit the prestige and
attention of a presidential summit with US President Bill Clinton in
Washington to reinforce the widely held notion that mainland China is
poised to recapture its traditional role as a major world power and
should be treated with respect and reverence.</P>
      <P>Many normally skeptical observers of international affairs have
long since concluded that mainland China's rise is inevitable and
that the Communist Party under Jiang's leadership is on course for
greatness. Even the current financial turmoil that has gripped East
and Southeast Asia over the last four months and shattered the "Asian
miracle" has not shaken this belief.</P>
      <P>For some inexplicable reason, mainland China is widely considered
to be immune from this convulsion as some of the region's corrupt,
inefficient and greedy business and political cultures are cruelly
exposed, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>But in reality, the economic and political problems in the
world's most populous country "make Thailand look well managed and
Jiang should be viewed as the weak leader of a nation in deep
crisis," the Herald said.</P>
      <P>The daily reported that, while Western leaders, diplomats,
academics and tourists have marveled at the Chinese revival, most of
them have ignored the huge problems now mainland China is facing.</P>
      <P>The daily said they see the high-rise buildings, but rarely ask
why many of them are empty.</P>
      <P>"They almost never ask, 'why build high-rises at all in the
middle of a slum?'" the daily reported.</P>
      <P>The daily's dispatch from Beijing also commented that Westerners
fail to write about that part of the Chinese economy which the
reformers left behind: the huge problems of mainland China's over
300,000 state-owned enterprises, which employ more than 100 million
and many of which are facing collapse, with hundreds of thousands of
workers already unemployed.</P>
      <P>These enterprises are obsolete and inefficient and have relied on
Chinese state bank loans to keep turning out shoddy and in many cases
unmarketable goods, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>"These loans have piled up to the point where even the World
Bank, traditionally restrained in its criticism of China, has warned
that a major financial system insolvency is approaching unless the
authorities contain the mounting debt," the daily reported.</P>
      <P>It said the number of unemployed people throughout mainland China
varies widely and accurate figures are probably impossible to come
by. But many tens of millions of urban mainland Chinese are now
unemployed and their ranks are certain to expand dramatically now
that the Chinese government has belatedly acknowledged that it must
reform the state-owned sector.</P>
      <P>The daily quoted analysts as saying that 30 million new jobless
will hit the streets. Others, including senior bureaucrats, say the
combined urban and rural unemployed will outnumber the population of
the United States -- 265 million -- in the near future.</P>
      <P>The Beijing leadership is banking on more burgeoning economic
growth to provide the jobs to soak up these surplus workers, but just
as the authorities begin to get tough with the state sector, the
20-year boom is running into trouble, the Herald reported.</P>
      <P>Foreign investment is slowing rapidly, consumer demand is also
falling, factory inventories continue to expand, losses from the
state sector mount rapidly and real estate markets are collapsing,
the daily observed.</P>
      <P>Corruption in mainland China flourishes as thousands of party
officials routinely abuse their positions, it said.</P>
      <P>The daily suggested that US President Bill Clinton raise these
problems during his meeting with Jiang in Washington.</P>
      <P>Instead of the usual assurances foreign leaders give about
engaging rather containing an emerging colossus, Clinton should
recognize that Jiang heads a chronically weak and unstable country.</P>
      <P>"China doesn't need engagement or containment. China needs help,"
the dispatch concluded.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CULT GURU IS SENTENCED TO 7 YEARS IN PRISON FOR FRAUD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  30  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei District Court on Thursday
sentenced a cult guru to seven years in prison for fraud.</P>
      <P>Taipei District Judge Tsay Kun-hu sentenced both Sung Chi-li, the
spiritual leader of the "Sung Chi-li Association," and his head
disciple Chen Cheng-dung to seven year prison terms, declaring that
the two should be punished for swindling hundreds of millions of NT
dollars from the followers of the association.</P>
      <P>Sung, born Sung Gan-lin, was arrested last October on charges of
fraud. According to court documents, Sung conspired with Chen and
some other defendants to pretend to be a religious guru with seven
supernatural powers in order to swindle money from followers.</P>
      <P>Chen, who met Sung while they both were serving sentences in
Taipei Prison, pretended to be Sung's disciple to testify to what
they would later claim were Sung's supernatural powers.</P>
      <P>Another defendant, Lo Cheng-hung, a photographer, doctored photos
to make Sung appear to be flying atop golden clouds or encircled by
halos. The cult leader used the photos as "proof" of his supernatural
powers and to solicit donations from his followers.</P>
      <P>For his part in the scam, Lo was sentenced on Thursday to two
years in prison.</P>
      <P>Another defendant, You Fang-chih, wife of Hsieh Chang-ting, the
former Democratic Progressive Party vice presidential candidate, was
found not guilty of helping Sung find believers.</P>
      <P>You had been prosecuted for compiling a book to promote Sung's
alleged magical powers and receiving over NT$3 million (US$100,000)
in payment for this.</P>
      <P>Hsieh told a news conference in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan, that
he was not surprised by the "not guilty" verdict, saying that his
wife's involvement in the case was wholly masterminded by an
"anti-Hsieh" ring and underground forces to reduce his political
influence.</P>
      <P>Around 100 followers of the Sung Chi-li Association were present
at the reading of the verdicts, though Sung himself was not. These
local believers expressed their unhappiness with the court's
decisions.</P>
      <P>When Sung was arrested about a year ago, many of his followers
prayed on their knees in front of the association's headquarters in
Taipei, refusing to believe their guru was a fraud.</P>
      <P>You Yin-fu, Sung's lawyer, announced that he will appeal, calling
the sentence "unjust" and saying he believes it was imposed under
pressure.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC ON CLINTON-JIANG MEETING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.   30   (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chang King-yuh, chairman of the
Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), said Thursday that the
meeting between US President Bill Clinton and mainland Chinese
President Jiang Zemin showed that the relations between Washington
and Beijing are under a new framework.</P>
      <P>Chang said that if the relations between Washington and Beijing
progress normally under the new framework, this will put a great deal
of pressure on the Republic of China in the long run.</P>
      <P>Chang was referring to the joint statement issued by Clinton and
Jiang on Wednesday, part of which said regular strategic meetings
will be held between the two governments at every level, including
annual meetings between the two heads of state.</P>
      <P>Jiang's visit was the first by a mainland Chinese leader to the
United States in 12 years.</P>
      <P>On how to deal with the new situation, Chang, the government's
top mainland policy maker, said that Taiwan should on one hand step
up security talks with high-level US officials, and on the other hand
actively seek to break the impasse of stalled cross-strait relations
to establish a mechanism of bilateral exchanges.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the ROC's stance is clear, Chang said, "The ROC
does not want Washington-Beijing relations to undermine the relations
between Washington and Taipei, nor should the United States trade the
concessions it gets from mainland China at the expense of Taiwan's
interests."</P>
      <P>He said Washington-Beijing relations should run parallel to those
between Washington and Taipei, and that if the United States improves
and upgrades its relationship with mainland China, it should also
step up its ties with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>With Clinton and Jiang pledging regular "strategic meetings," all
issues between the two sides will be worked out within these systemic
channels, which in the long run will put great pressure on the ROC,
Chang said.</P>
      <P>Beijing, for example, could use the new channels to undermine US
support for the ROC or to add pressure on the ROC's efforts to seek a
greater profile in the international community.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SOUTHEAST ASIAN POLITICS HAVE NOT KEPT UP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Oct.  29  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Amid the currency and stock turmoil in
Southeast Asia, one factor has been politely overlooked and
underplayed, or simply taken for granted -- the web of patronage,
cronyism and corruption that inhabits markets and deters effective
government action, a Financial Post article pointed out Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Clearly, Southeast Asian countries do not have a monopoly on
corruption and patronage. Nor is this exclusively a developing
country phenomenon, wrote Marie-Jose Kravis. Nonetheless, in this
specific instance, the world cannot ignore the deleterious effects
corruption has on economic development, she pointed out.</P>
      <P>Truthfully, politics have failed to keep up with economics, she
observed. "Consequently, governments have shied away from adjustments
required to encourage competition and improve economic efficiency,"
she added.</P>
      <P>Generally, Southeast Asian economies have tried to merge their
centralized industrial policy process with market forces. The
challenge ahead, however, requires "more determined and widespread
espousal of markets, decisions by governments to support markets
through efficient investments in physical, legal and institutional
infrastructure, and greater integration into the world economy," said
the columnist who is also a fellow of the Hudson Institute.</P>
      <P>Can this be achieved in the current context of centralized
decisionmaking, patronage and cronyism? she asked. How can these
countries implement measures to diversify ownership and develop
property rights and asset exchanges without tackling political
reforms? How can they promise to reduce or eliminate arbitrary
barriers to entry and exit in various industries without shaking up
the protected business monopolies of favored investors? How can they
propose to sign international trade agreements and investment codes
if they are not willing to guarantee their implementation?</P>
      <P>It is indeed difficult to deny that, until now, the Southeast
Asian model of economic development has worked. But it is now
ill-suited to a world economy that rewards nimbleness, competition,
openness and transparency, she said.</P>
      <P>The latest financial crisis has, for example, exposed the
deficiencies in the banking systems of almost all these countries.
The quality and timeliness of information have borne the brunt of
unmitigated criticism. Supervision of financial systems has also been
a target of complaint. Reform entails restructuring, privatizing and
modernizing state-owned banks and the banking system in general. It
also requires independent audits and dissemination of information in
a useful and timely fashion.</P>
      <P>Inevitably, this should expose sweetheart deals and other
irregularities. As sounder business practices spread to other
industrial sectors, governments will inevitably be challenged, she
predicted. Ideally, corruption will begin to wane.</P>
      <P>Inevitably, cronyism and patronage prohibit sound decisionmaking
and delay elimination of tariffs and obsolete regulation. Greed
prevents open markets and competition. Yet, slowly these countries
must modernize their political systems as well as their economic
plans and business practices.</P>
      <P>"We would be remiss if we failed to insist institutionalized
corruption and long-term development are incompatible. The issue
needs a place on the front burner," she concluded.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TUGS OF WAR ARE SAFE IF RULES ARE FOLLOWED: S'PORE EXPERT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore, Oct. 30 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Tugs of war are safe, as long as players
are fit and stick to the rules and regulations of the game, say
sports officials and experts in Singapore.</P>
      <P>In a bizarre tragedy in Taipei last Saturday, two men taking part
in a tug of war match had their arms torn off. Another 43 were hurt.</P>
      <P>The event, involving 1,600 people -- 800 on each side -- was to
have set the world record for the longest tug of war with 150 meters
of rope.</P>
      <P>The tragedy might have been prevented if the organizers had taken
adequate safety precautions, said sports officials here.</P>
      <P>"Tug of war is basically not a dangerous sport, but it is
extremely strenuous," said S. Govindaraju, chairman of tug of war at
the Singapore Amateur Athletic Association (SAAA).</P>
      <P>"Most important, players have to be healthy, fit and trained in
the game," he said.</P>
      <P>The game is popular in Singapore, where universities and many
companies organize tug of war games. No serious injuries have been
reported over the past two years.</P>
      <P>The SAAA, which helped organize a tug of war for the Singapore
police force in July, is thinking of setting up training programs
this year for other matches.</P>
      <P>Training would include endurance-building on the track and in the
gym, as well as rope-handling techniques.</P>
      <P>Asthmatics, diabetics and people with weak hearts or lungs are
also advised to get medical advice before taking part.</P>
      <P>Sticking to the rules of the game -- an international competitive
sport -- is also important, said Govindaraju.</P>
      <P>The International Tug of War Federation has rules governing the
number of players, their combined weight and even the way the rope is
held, for example.</P>
      <P>"For example, there shouldn't be any mass participation, or the
situation might get out of control and result in a stampede," he
said.</P>
      <P>Finally, use common-sense safety precautions, he said. To prevent
abrasion, for example, players should don thick, long-sleeved
clothing; outdoor participants should wear boots, and indoor
participants should wear sports shoes.</P>

      <P>A "single stop" investment service
mechanism, proposed by Premier Vincent Siew some two months ago, is
slated to begin operations Nov. 3 at the Industrial Development
Bureau (IDB).</P>
      <P>Siew, upon his inauguration as premier on Sept. 1, told the

      <P>The investment service center will be divided into five sections,
with officials from six Cabinet-level agencies and 33 Taiwan
provincial offices as the backbone of the team.</P>

      <P>The first hospital in Saudi Arabia
dedicated exclusively to the treatment of falcons has been
established in Jeddah.</P>
      <P>The hospital has been built as an extension of the Jeddah
Veterinary Clinic. It has facilities for more than 50 falcons and has
been designed to meet the growing demand from falconers in the
country.</P>
      <P>Falconry is very popular in the Gulf region, and there are
thousands of falcons in various parts of Saudi Arabia.</P>
      <P>Before the establishment of this facility, falconers here had to
turn to veterinary hospitals and clinics in Dubai and Abu Dhabi.</P>
      <P>Dr. Maurice Nicholson, chief veterinary surgeon, said as falcons
are caught in the wild, they face problems of stress and nutrition.
The longer the birds are kept in captivity, the greater the
possibility of sickness, he said.</P>
      <P>Nicholson said the majority of falcon diseases are easily
preventable or at the least controllable and therefore urged the
birds' owners to get them examined routinely.</P>

    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Oct.  29  (CNA)
(By S.C. CHANG)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin
offered no regrets for the Tiananmen Square massacre during his White
House visit Wednesday while President Bill Clinton bluntly lectured
his guest on human rights during a lively public debate, Canadian
media reported.</P>
      <P>The Canadian Broadcasting Corp. (CBC) said that Jiang clashed
with Clinton over human rights and the Tiananmen Square massacre at a
news conference in Washington on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Clinton urged "full room for debate, dissent and freedom to
worship" in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Jiang, however, in response to a reporter's question about the
June 1989 incident at Tiananmen Square where an estimated 1,000
people died, said mainland China was facing a political disturbance
that disrupted social stability.</P>
      <P>Clinton replied that he believes Beijing was on the wrong side of
history, CBC TV said.</P>
      <P>The Canadian Press (CP) noted the polite but pointed exchange was
remarkable for its directness. "It also exposed the kind of divisions
the two leaders tried to bridge during a day-long White House
meeting," it added.</P>
      <P>Human rights is the primary fault line in US-mainland Chinese
relations, the CP report said. Jiang tied the issue to Beijing's
sovereignty. Clinton warned his counterpart that Beijing's human
rights stance puts it on "the wrong side of history."</P>
      <P>The Communist leadership's refusal to tolerate political dissent
has been a drag on mainland China's influence around the world, the
CP quoted Clinton as saying.</P>
      <P>"Over the long-run, the societies of the 21st century that will
do best will be those that are drawing their stability from their
differences," he said as Jiang looked on, according to the CP.</P>
      <P>Beijing won a reiteration of Washington's "One China" policy,
which calls for a peaceful reconciliation between mainland China and
Taiwan. Beijing regards Taiwan as a renegade province, and although
Jiang said he favors a negotiated solution, he added that mainland
China reserves the right to use force if the island attempts to
declare independence, the CP reported.</P>
      <P>Although the United States and mainland China share important
interests, "we also have fundamental differences, especially
concerning human rights and religious freedom," Clinton said, adding
that the best way to address them is "directly and personally."</P>
      <P>Jiang said he is enjoying his brush with democracy but that
"sometimes noises came into my ears."</P>
      <P>He was likely alluding to a noisy protest in favor of a free
Tibet being held outside the White House. It was led by actor Richard
Gere, who told the crowd that six million Tibetans are still living
in slavery, the CP noted.</P>
      <P>"This is not a cuddly new China we're talking about," he said.
"It's the same China we've known for the past 50 years."</P>

      <P>Tukik Toeman, the head of the provincial health office, was
quoted by the Antara news agency as saying Wednesday that a total of
23,303 sufferers of respiratory problems had sought medical attention
at local clinics and hospitals between July and September.</P>
      <P>He said 11 people had died of the problems in local hospitals
during the same period.</P>
      <P>The official also called on area residents to reduce their time
outdoors. They should also close their doors and windows, and drink
more liquids in order to avoid lung irritation caused by the smoke.</P>
      <P>The warning is especially aimed at children and elderly people.</P>
      <P>"The concentration of dust particles in this region's air has far
exceeded the level considered safe for humans," Tukik said.</P>
      <P>On Oct. 24, for instance, dust particles reached 2,910 milligrams
per cubic meter, or 11 times the safe level of 260 mg/m3.</P>
      <P>The Indonesian Ministry of Health recently reported that in each
of the 12 provinces it studied, approximately 20,000 people had
fallen ill of respiratory problems because of the haze.</P>
      <P>The brush and forest fires that have raged for months and choked
the region with smoke have brought Indonesia international criticism.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Environmental Impact and Management Agency
described in its report Wednesday that the forest fire situation has
not yet improved.</P>
      <P>Satellite monitoring on Tuesday showed that thick, choking smoke
still blanketed much of Indonesia.</P>

      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Wang
Chih-kang Thursday welcomed President Bill Clinton's call for an
early resumption of talks between Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>President Clinton said Wednesday after he talked with mainland

that cross-strait issues shall be resolved by the Chinese people on
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait by peaceful means, and that the

      <P>Wang welcomed President Clinton's call, and said it is Beijing's
refusal to abandon the use of military force against Taiwan that
hinders the improvement of cross-strait relations. Jiang said
Wednesday that as the Taiwan issue is connected with the sovereignty
of mainland China, "we can not promise to abandon force."</P>
      <P>Wang said Beijing's early decision to end its hostile posture

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei District Court on Thursday
sentenced mystic cult guru Sung Chi-li to a seven-year prison term
for fraud, after a court case which began in December last year.</P>
      <P>Sung's head disciple, Chen Cheng-dung, also received seven years,
while Lo Cheng-hung, a photographer, was sentenced to two years.
Fifteen other defendants, all of whom were Sung's devoted followers,
were acquitted.</P>
      <P>Court documents said that Sung conspired with the other
defendants to masquerade as a religious guru with seven supernatural
powers. The cult used photographs, doctored by Lo, showing Sung
floating in the sky with an aureole around his head, to swindle
millions of Taiwan dollars from the cult members.</P>
      <P>Chen and Sung first met in Taipei Prison, where the two were
serving jail terms for other convictions. They decided to create a
mystic cult around Sung, who would claim to have supernatural powers,
including the ability to duplicate himself. Chen's job was to testify
to the authenticity of Sung's magical powers.</P>
      <P>The court said that the other 15 defendants, who were charged
with either helping Sung recruit believers or writing articles and
books testifying to Sung's unusual powers, were found not guilty due
to insufficient evidence.</P>
      <P>Among the acquitted co-defendants was You Fang-chih, wife of
opposition Democratic Progress Party heavyweight Hsieh Chang-ting.
You was accused of compiling a book to promote Sung's alleged powers

    <HEADLINE>ROC PRESIDENT REVIEWS RESTRUCTURED ARMY BRIGADES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 30 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui on Thursday reviewed
two newly restructured army units in northern Taiwan -- the armored
infantry brigade and the airborne cavalry brigade.</P>
      <P>The formation of the two brigades is part of the Republic of
China's military modernization plan aimed at streamlining the
country's military and establishing an elite deterrent force.</P>
      <P>Lee first reviewed the armored infantry brigade, which has
integrated elements of the original armored and infantry brigades, at
the Hukou army base in Hsinchu County, some 75 km south of the
capital, Taipei. Later in the day, he reviewed the airborne cavalry
brigade at the Lungtan military base in northern Taoyuan County.</P>
      <P>The formation of the new combined brigades marks the first time
in decades that the ROC military has restructured its fundamental
strategic units.</P>
      <P>More than 4,300 military servicemen and hundreds of armored
vehicles, tanks and artillery pieces, as well as various types of
helicopter, took part in the review.</P>
      <P>In a speech to the armored infantry brigade, the president said
that the military restructuring plan is critical to upgrading
Taiwan's defense capabilities.</P>
      <P>"The organization of the two combined army brigades, albeit still
at an experimental stage, marks a big step forward in our
second-generation military build-up program," Lee said, stressing
that Taiwan should heighten its vigilance against the potential
threat posed by Beijing and accelerate the implementation of the
military streamlining plan to ensure national security.</P>
      <P>Military spokesman Gen. Kung Fan-ding told assembled press
covering the events that the formation of the new combined brigades
marks a distinct change in Taiwan's defense strategy and tactics.</P>
      <P>The combined brigades will replace the division as the
fundamental strategic unit, Kung said, adding that they will be more
responsive to emergency situations. He elaborated further, saying the
new brigades will be faster, more mechanized and equipped with
night-time combat capabilities.</P>
      <P>Military experts said the most dramatic change to Taiwan's
defense strategy will come with the inauguration of the airborne
attack brigade, comprising a scout helicopter battalion, an attack
helicopter battalion, a special operations helicopter battalion, a
support battalion and an aircraft repair and maintenance workshop.
The brigade is equipped with AH-1W gunships, OH-58D Super Cobra
scout/attack helicopters, B-234 transport helicopters and OH-1H
helicopters.</P>
      <P>The army plans to integrate the existing aviation groups and
airborne brigades into three airborne cavalry brigades. In addition
to the brigade at Lungtan, the army will deploy similar brigades in
central and southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In preparation for the formation of these additional airborne
cavalry brigades, the army has struck deals with the United States
for the purchase of 21 AH-1W gunships and OH-58D Super Cobra
helicopters, and 12 B-234 transport helicopters.</P>

(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Renato Ruggiero, Director General of the
Geneva-based World Trade Organization (WTO), announced on Thursday
that his office will hold a high-profile celebration on May 20, 1998
to mark the 50th anniversary of the signing of the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).</P>
      <P>"Today marks the 50th anniversary of the birth of the
multilateral trading system. The creation of this system surely ranks
among the greatest economic achievements of the post-war era. For the
first time, the principle of non-discrimination in trade relations
was applied on a multilateral basis. Through this principle, the same
rights of market access were extended to all 23 of the original
signing nations, developed and developing alike. Today, the World
Trade Organization, the offspring of the GATT, has 132 members, all
of which have adopted the principle of non-discrimination. It is
difficult to overstate the contribution of this basic principle to
growth and development on a world scale and to the establishment of
closer relations among nations," Ruggiero said.</P>
      <P>He went on: "On May 20, 1998, we will hold a high-profile
celebration to mark the occasion of these 50 years and highlight for
the citizens of the world the contribution this system has made to
global peace and prosperity."</P>
      <P>On October 30, 1947, the GATT was signed by 23 nations -- 12
developed and 11 developing economies -- at the Palais des
Nations in Geneva. The agreement contained tariff concessions agreed
to during the first multilateral trade negotiations and a set of
rules designed to prevent these concessions from being frustrated by
restrictive trade measures.</P>
      <P>On January 1, 1948, GATT came into force. The 23 founding members
were: Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Burma, Canada, Ceylon, Chile,
China, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, France, India, Lebanon, Luxembourg,
Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Pakistan, Rhodesia, Syria, South
Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China on Friday expressed
admiration for the consistent stance of the United States on the
Taiwan issue during the meetings in Washington on Oct. 29-30 between
President Bill Clinton and mainland China's President Jiang Zemin.</P>
      <P>A statement issued by the ROC Ministry of Foreign Affairs
immediately after the Clinton-Jiang summit said the United States has
not departed from its long-standing stance on the Taiwan issue and
its commitment to the ROC.</P>
      <P>Washington has repeatedly assured the ROC of its policy of not
allowing US dealings with Beijing to affect the interests of the ROC
and this policy remains unchanged, the statement said. The statement
also praised Clinton for his firm stance on democracy, freedom and
human rights issues in his talks with Jiang.</P>
      <P>During his meetings with Jiang, Clinton said the Taiwan issue
should be resolved by the Chinese themselves through peaceful means,
although Washington continues to stick to its one-China policy.</P>
      <P>The ROC government welcomes high-level contacts between
Washington and Beijing if such engagements can contribute to peace
and stability in the Asia-Pacific region and help promote further
reform, openness and human rights development on the Chinese
mainland, the statement continued.</P>
      <P>However, the ROC government will continue to monitor closely the
development of relations between mainland China and the United
States, in order to guard against plots by Beijing to undermine the
interests of the ROC under the cover of improving ties with the
United States, the statement said.</P>
      <P>"We must stress that efforts made by the United States to improve
its ties with mainland China should not affect the freedom, democracy
and human rights of the Republic of China or any other regions in the
world," it said.</P>
      <P>The statement also said that the ROC will strengthen its mutually
beneficial relations with the United States, while pushing for
pragmatic diplomacy and an increase in reciprocal cross-Taiwan Strait
exchanges to ensure the peace and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific
region.</P>

      <P>Yuang Chen, CAL's public relations director, denied that the

      <P>The mainland office belongs to an affiliate of CAL which is

      <P>The impact on Taiwan of mainland China's
membership of the Information Technology Agreement (ITA) under the

Taiwan's economic minister said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Wang Chih-kang said that once the mainland becomes a signatory to

willingness to invest in the mainland, but on the other hand, it will
benefit Taiwan's exports of information products to the mainland due
to low or even zero tariffs on such products.</P>
      <P>Wang said that Taiwan has reached agreement with the signatories
of the ITA, including the US and Japan, on the gradual elimination of
tariffs on information products. Except for eight special items on
which tariffs will not be eliminated until 2002, tariffs on the other
201 information items are to be reduced to zero in four stages by

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  30  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The following are excerpts from an
editorial carried in Thursday's edition of local English-language
daily the China News, entitled "Patience needed, not courage."</P>
      <P>"No government official has any right to tell investors not to
sell their stocks or their currency. If Taiwan's mom 'n pop stock
punters believe the Taiex is too high, then it is too high. If the
government wants to use its own money to buy their stocks, that's
fine, but it had better know what it is doing. Because if the market
continues to fall, as it did yesterday (Wednesday), then the public
has every right to complain that its hard-earned taxes are being
wasted in an attempt to interfere with market forces...</P>
      <P>"In fact, a quick look at the turmoil which has gripped regional
stock and currency markets, and subsequently spread to the rest of
the world, would suggest... what is being experienced is not a
meltdown, but a big and dramatic correction.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has more to be optimistic about than all its neighbors...
Just as it was the Asia-Pacific's best-performing market before the
recent turbulence, so it will likely be at the forefront of a
region-wide recovery.</P>
      <P>"Various spokesmen have been at pains to point out that average
price-earnings ratios are down to about 25... On a historical basis,
this is high compared to mature economies, but reasonable for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"To gain a broader understanding of why Taiwan ought to be
feeling more comfortable about its economic future than it is at
present, a closer look at its economic make-up is needed. Unlike
Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines and Indonesia, Taiwan has not
been borrowing beyond its means and is not dependent on massive
capital infusions to spur growth. Basically, it is more mature than
the Southeast Asian tigers... Most important is that Taiwan's markets
are not ruled by institutional investors, as much of the region is.
Foreign funds make up less than four percent of trading here.</P>
      <P>"If the government is prepared to lead by example, with a sincere
and realistic approach to instilling confidence in its markets, then
there is cause to believe Taiwan will resume its successful ways in
the months to come.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CBC HIGHLIGHTS 'PROFOUND DIFFERENCE' BETWEEN US, M'LAND CHINA ON HUMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Oct.  29 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Canada's national broadcaster highlighted
the "profound and public disagreement" over human rights between the
presidents of the United States and mainland China at the end of their
summit Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Canadian Broadcasting Corp. headlined the story in its major
news program, "The World at Six." It noted that Jiang Zemin's visit
to the White House marked the first US-China summit since the
Tiananmen Square massacre eight years ago.</P>
      <P>Bill Clinton, despite scattered protests from left- and
right-wing groups, is pursuing his policy of "cooperation, not
confrontation" with mainland China, the CBC pointed out. But he
dropped his diplomatic language when he sharply criticized
mainland China's activities in the Tiananmen Square, and Jiang was
"just as sharp in his responses," it said.</P>
      <P>Jiang, speaking through an interpreter, repeated the Chinese line
that the army had to act to prevent anarchy in Tiananmen Square: "If
a country with over 1.2 billion population does not enjoy social and
political stability, it cannot possibly have the situation of reform
and opening up that we're having today."</P>
      <P>Bill Clinton, gripping the lectern in impatience, shot back: "We
have a very different view of the meaning of the events in Tiananmen
Square," according to a CBC report from Washington, DC.</P>
      <P>And so at the edgy and surprisingly lengthy debate between the
two leaders, it was not, as you might expect, a debate either man
wants, the report said. "We have profound disagreements," Clinton was
quoted as saying. "But that does not mean this visit should not have
occurred or that we don't have a big interest in continuing to work
together."</P>
      <P>The summit did result in a promise from mainland China to limit
exports of dangerous nucleus technology, and an agreement to meet
every year, the report pointed out. Next year, Clinton will go to
mainland China.</P>
      <P>It was not a lot to show for the meeting, but then not a lot was
expected, said the report. Both mainland Chinese and US officials
stressed the importance of the symbolism that the summit occurred at
all, given the testiness of the past relations, it noted.</P>
      <P>It pointed to the scenes across the street from the summit site,
where demonstrators chanted slogans all day on mainland China's
records on everything from Tibet to religious freedom.</P>
      <P>However intransigent Jiang sounded about Tiananmen Square,
mainland China has agreed to allow religious leaders to visit. And it
has agreed, at least, to ongoing talks about human rights, "something
Jiang will hear more about tomorrow, when he meets with members of
Congress," the CBC said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CONSUMPTION OF TEXTILE INCREASING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Asuncion,  Oct.  29  (CNA)
(By Stephen Sheng)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>According to a report presented at the
Plenary Meeting of the International Cotton Advisory Committee
convening in Asuncion, the world textile consumption of end-use
products increased 3.1 percent in 1996, more than double the rate of
growth in 1995.</P>
      <P>The increased consumption was attributed to faster global
economic growth last year.</P>
      <P>Current projections for income, population and price suggest that
the world textile consumption will increase 2.6% in 1997 and 1998,
and 2.4% in 1999. Long-term projections suggest that the world
textile consumption could increase at an average annual rate of 2.3%
through 2005, the report indicated.</P>
      <P>The report also said that after seven years of stagnation at
about 18.5 million tons, world cotton consumption at the end-use
level increased 1.9% to reach a new record high of 19 million tons in
1996.</P>
      <P>Consumption of cotton is expected to increase at an average
annual rate of 1.9% during the next three years to reach 20 million
in 1999. But due to the fact that consumption of non-cotton fibers
continued to expand faster than the consumption of cotton, the market
share of cotton declined for the sixth consecutive year to reach a
44.7% share last year. Current projections suggest that cotton will
continue to lose its share of the world textile market, dipping to
43.7% in 2000 and 42.8% in 2005.</P>
      <P>World production of cotton and chemical fiber yarn increased 2.9%
in 1996, reflecting the rapid increase in end-use consumption of
textiles. By 1998, world production of cotton yarn is expected to
reach 18.5 million tons, with the chemical yarn reaching 24 million
tons.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ANALYSTS DISCUSS CLINTON'S "ONE CHINA" PRINCIPLE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  30  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US President Bill Clinton's statement
following his meeting on Wednesday with mainland China's President
Jiang Zemin that the US will continue to stick to its "one China"
policy has sparked heated discussion among local scholars, experts
and politicians.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a seminar sponsored by the Forward Looking Policy
Center on the impact of Wednesday's Clinton-Jiang meeting, Chiu
Chao-lin, a researcher at Taiwan's highest research institute,
Academia Sinica, said the meeting did not totally go against Taiwan's
interest. She said Washington's cautious handling of the Taiwan issue
and its emergent strategic partnership with mainland China will also
help maintain stability in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>However, she pointed out that the government should work out new
strategies to deal with its relations with mainland China and other
countries, as Clinton has linked his "one China" principle
to Taiwan's democratization and prosperity.</P>
      <P>Chang Lin-cheng, a professor of political science at National
Taiwan University, said Taiwan will become the loser in the
Taipei-Washington-Beijing triangle if it seeks to distance itself
from the "one China" framework.</P>
      <P>Lee Ying-yuan, a legislator of the pro-independence Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), disagreed with Chang, saying Taiwan should
continue maintaining its sovereignty and should seek better relations
with the US, Japan and the countries of Southeast Asia because
Taiwan's location is of vital importance to the security of those
countries.</P>
      <P>New Party Legislator Kao Hui-yu said Taiwan will face new
challenges in the wake of the Clinton-Jiang meeting amid the
increasingly cordial ties between the West and the mainland. She
urged the government to thoroughly review its policy toward mainland
China and adopt a more pragmatic approach to dealing with Beijing.</P>
      <P>Commenting on remarks by mainland China's Vice Premier Qian
Qichen to the media following the Clinton-Jiang meeting that Clinton
had made it clear to Jiang that the US will not support Taiwan
independence, will not support Taiwan's membership in the United
Nations and will not recognize "two Chinas," or "one China, one
Taiwan," both DPP and New Party officials in charge of their parties'
mainland policy said they were not surprised by Qian's statement.</P>
      <P>Yen Wan-chin, head of the DPP's Mainland Affairs Department, said
Taiwan should pay attention to the potential impact of the meeting on
US arms sales to Taiwan and on the exchange of ranking officials
between Taiwan and the US, since Washington is actively seeking
Beijing's participation in the Asia-Pacific security framework
advocated by Washington and Tokyo.</P>
      <P>Lee Ching-hua, convener of the New Party's Cross-Strait Affairs
Committee, pointed out that Clinton's statement is an indication that
Taiwan's hope that Washington can develop parallel relationships with
Taipei and Beijing is unrealistic. In fact, he said, the relationship
between Taipei, Washington, and Beijing is triangular.</P>
      <P>Lee further said that time is not on Taiwan's side and that the
government should try to reopen cross-strait talks, the sooner the
better, as Beijing has taken an increasingly tough stand on issues of
mutual concern such as the "three links" and Taiwan's presence in the
international community.</P>
      <P>However, Yang Kai-huang, political science professor at Soochow

terms of the three communiques signed by Washington and Beijing. He
said Clinton's "three no's" will have no substantial impact on
Taiwan-US relations, putting forward the opinion that the purpose of
Clinton's statement was aimed at forestalling instability in the
Taiwan Strait in order to protect US interests in the region.</P>

    <HEADLINE>`TAIWAN ISSUE' IS ONE OF DEMOCRACY, FREEDOM AND HUMAN RIGHTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  30  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>ROC President Lee Teng-hui was quoted as
saying on Thursday that the so-called "Taiwan issue" is simply one of
democracy, freedom and human rights.</P>
      <P>Foreign Minister Jason Hu, who briefed the president early on
Thursday on the just-concluded summit between mainland China's Jiang
Zemin and US President Bill Clinton, told a group of ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) legislators afterward that Lee, taking note of
Jiang's annoyance at Clinton's insistence on mentioning democracy,
freedom and human rights at the talks, said that it is very clear
that the Taiwan issue is simply the issue of democracy, freedom and
human rights.</P>
      <P>Describing the three principles as the founding principles of
both the Republic of China and the United States, Hu told the
lawmakers that Clinton's emphasis on them serves both the interest of
Washington and Taipei.</P>
      <P>The KMT Legislature caucus invited Hu to analyze the outcome of
the talks which took place early Thursday morning, Taiwan time.</P>
      <P>Despite pressure from Jiang, Clinton's stance on Taiwan remains
unchanged, said Hu.</P>
      <P>"There is no doubt that Jiang's summit with Clinton is a plus for
Washington-Beijing ties," the former ROC envoy to Washington said,
"but Washington has obviously taken heed of Taipei's appeal not to
mend fences with Beijing at Taipei's expense."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile Premier Vincent Siew issued a directive at a regular
cabinet meeting after Hu's briefing, saying that while the government
welcomes the improvement in ties between Beijing and Washington in
the context of helping stabilize the region, Taiwan should still
guard against a new campaign by Beijing to isolate the island in the
international community after the easing of tension with Washington.</P>
      <P>While heaving a sigh of relief at America's adherence to its
current policy toward Taiwan, the premier vowed to keep a close watch
on the developments in Beijing-Washington ties and to remain prepared
for any eventuality.</P>
      <P>He urged Washington to help Taipei balance the
Beijing-Washington-Taipei relations by improving Taipei-Washington
ties as well as supporting the island's bids to join various
international groups.</P>

    <DATELINE>Paris,  Oct.  30  (CNA)
(By Debbie Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Alsace region in eastern France is
wooing Taiwan investors with open arms, the Latest News of Alsace
reported on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Taipei Representative in France Kuo Wei-fan, the ROC's de facto
ambassador to that European country, led a delegation of government
officials and Taiwan business leaders to Alsace on Thursday for a
fact-finding tour of the pivotal French industrial area.</P>
      <P>Kuo and the dozen-member delegation received a warm greeting when
they arrived in Strasbourg. Among those on hand to meet them were the
Alsace governor, speaker of the Alsace legislature and local
government officials.</P>
      <P>The region of Alsace, Lorraine and Saar, which borders Germany,
has been a "golden triangle" of heavy industry in Western Europe.
Formerly a steel industry hub due to its coal production, the
triangle is nowadays a center of precision and high-technology
industries.</P>
      <P>Human talent and capital have steadily flowed into the region in
recent years, attracted by its high-caliber manufacturing capacity,
commendable social conditions, sound infrastructure development, and
quality financial, telecommunications and transport service systems.</P>
      <P>The latest joint-venture between Germany's Daimler-Mercedes and
Swiss timepiece maker Swatch to make the environmentally friendly
"Smart" compact car is located in Lorraine.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the paper, Kuo said Taiwan is currently the
seventh largest capital source in the world. Until recently, a great
majority of Taiwan investments in Europe have centered in the
Netherlands, England and Ireland, mainly because there are fewer
language barriers existing in those countries, Kuo noted.</P>
      <P>That investment pattern could be reversed if more Taiwan
businesses opt to relocate their operations to Alsace, which is
highly promising as a gateway for Taiwan manufacturers and traders to
other major markets in France, Belgium, Holland and Switzerland, he
added.</P>
      <P>So far there is only one Taiwan company, a liquid crystal display
manufacturer, operating in the Alsace region.</P>
      <P>Kuo and his mission will also visit other industrial cities in
the region, including Colnar and Mulhouse, to measure the investment
climate there.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  31  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui presided over a
ceremony at the Presidential Office on Friday to mark the 111th birth
anniversary of the late President and Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek,
who passed away in 1975.</P>
      <P>More than 500 people, including Vice President Lien Chan, senior
central and local government officials, elected representatives and
overseas Chinese community representatives, attended the memorial
gathering.</P>
      <P>Examination Yuan President Hsu Shui-teh delivered a speech at the
ceremony, recounting the late president's outstanding achievements
during his lifetime.</P>
      <P>Hsu said Chiang had devoted his lifetime to eradicating any
hurdles to the implementation of the ROC national founding father Dr.
Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People and to building the ROC
into a prosperous constitutional democracy.</P>
      <P>"Chiang's courage and spirit in overcoming difficulties has been
a major source of strength and inspiration for our country," Hsu
noted.</P>
      <P>With the concerted efforts of the government and people, Hsu
said, the ROC has managed to create the first-stage "Taiwan
experience," which is acknowledged around the world and has enabled
local people to lead materially affluent lives.</P>
      <P>However, Hsu said, Taiwan's development in the areas of culture
and the arts has failed to parallel its successes in economic
progress. "As a result, our society has suffered from moral decline
and social disorder in recent years."</P>
      <P>In commemorating the late president, Hsu said, local people
should faithfully support the spiritual revitalization campaign
initiated by President Lee and promote a second-stage "Taiwan
experience," which will be characterized by a balance between
spiritual and material development.</P>
      <P>After the ceremony, Vice Premier John Chang visited Generalissimo
Chiang's temporary mausoleum in Tzuhu, Taoyuan County, some 30
kilometers south of Taipei, to pay his tributes to the late national
leader. Chang is an illegitimate son of the late President Chiang
Ching-kuo, who was the generalissimo's eldest son.</P>
      <P>Many elderly retired soldiers and civilians also visited Tzuhu to
pay tribute to the late leader.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, hundreds of overseas Chinese representatives gathered
at the National Concert Hall in the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall
complex in downtown Taipei to mark the anniversary.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the occasion, James Chu, minister of the Overseas
Chinese Affairs Commission, said the late president had strived to
develop Taiwan as a bastion for building a free and democratic China.</P>
      <P>Despite Beijing's incessant efforts to block Taiwan's presence in
the international community, Chu said, the ROC government has firmly
implemented liberal economic policies and promoted democratic
reforms.</P>
      <P>"I earnestly hope that all overseas Chinese compatriots will
continue to support the ROC's consistent policy and its efforts to
expand its international breathing space," Chu urged.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOV'T URGED TO DEVISE STRATEGY FOR POST-SUMMIT ERA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  31 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of local scholars on Friday urged
the government to formulate strategies to cope with new developments
in the wake of a high-profile summit meeting between US President
Bill Clinton and his mainland Chinese counterpart, Jiang Zemin, in
the White House on Oct. 29.</P>
      <P>The academics made the call at a seminar on relations across the
Taiwan Strait in the post-summit era.</P>
      <P>Professor Chang Lin-cheng of National Taiwan University said the
United States and mainland China have decided to work toward a
long-term strategic partnership following the Clinton-Jiang summit.</P>
      <P>"The decision was made after prudent consideration," Chang said,
adding that a constructive partnership with Washington is expected to
increase Beijing's leverage in dealing with Taiwan-related issues.</P>
      <P>Echoing Chang's views, National Chengchi University professor
Shaw Chung-hai said although Taipei claims that the
Washington-Beijing strategic partnership is more symbolic than
substantive, it signals that the two sides will work more closely in
the international arena in the future.</P>
      <P>As a result, Shwa warned, Beijing will have a louder voice in the
global community, while Taiwan's international status will be further
weakened.</P>
      <P>Professor Pan Hsi-tang of Tamkang University said the strategic
partnership implies an alliance in which the United States and
mainland China cooperate with one another despite holding divergent
views on certain issues.</P>
      <P>In the wake of the Clinton-Jiang summit, Pan said, the ROC
government should take the initiative to prevent Taiwan from being
sidelined in the critical triangular Taipei-Washington-Beijing
relationship. "If that fails, Taiwan's presence in the international
community will be further constricted," he asserted.</P>
      <P>Touching on cross-strait affairs, Pan said whether Taiwan can
convince Washington to maintain a balance between relations with
Beijing and Taipei in the post-summit era will hinge on its ability
to reduce cross-strait tensions and resume regular dialogue with the
mainland in the shortest time possible.</P>
      <P>Wei Yun, a professor at National Chiaotung University, said the
government has been too sensitive in its handling cross-strait
affairs. He urged the government to make an overall review of the
country's development policy and to prevent its pragmatic diplomacy
initiatives from hindering cross-strait rapprochement.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RESUME CROSS-STRAIT DIALOGUE 'THE SOONER, THE BETTER': HU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  31  (CNA)
(By Debbie Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Commenting on a call for resumption of
talks between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait which was issued
upon conclusion of this week's Clinton-Jiang summit, ROC Foreign
Affairs Minister Jason Hu expressed hope on Friday that the dialogue
will be resumed "the sooner, the better."</P>
      <P>The two sides should "restart from where the talks broke up,"
without setting any preconditions, Hu said. Beijing unilaterally
suspended dialogue with Taipei in protest at ROC President Lee
Teng-hui's visit to the United States in June 1995.</P>
      <P>Hu's remarks were made in downtown Taichung, central Taiwan,
where he was attending a luncheon hosted by retired servicemen on the
occasion of the 111th birth anniversary of the late President and
Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek.</P>
      <P>Although hoping that the cross-strait dialogue will be resumed at
an early date, Hu said the actual timeframe will be determined by the
Mainland Affairs Council, which charts Taiwan's policy toward
mainland China.</P>
      <P>On speculation that next spring will be the most likely juncture
for the resumption of talks, Hu asked the Taiwan public to adopt a
"wait and see" attitude, adding that a number of objective and
subjective factors still must be considered.</P>
      <P>In addition to urging an early resumption of the cross-strait
dialogue, Hu also called for an upgrading of bilateral relations
between Taiwan and the United States.</P>
      <P>Hu suggested that more frequent and regular meetings as well as
increased channels of communication between high-level officials from
the United States and the ROC would be useful in allowing Americans
to better understand Taiwan's situation and its needs.</P>

      <P>Taiwan was the fourth largest "foreign

according to a report released by the United Nations recently.</P>
      <P>Taiwan trailed Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea, but ranked
ahead of mainland China, which placed fifth.</P>
      <P>The UN report said global "foreign direct investment" amounted to
US$34.7 billion in 1996, up 2 percent from the 1995 level, while
global inbound foreign investment rose 10 percent to US$34.9 billion.</P>
      <P>Among developed economies, the top three FDI recipients were the
United States, Britain and France in that order. Belgium and
Luxembourg tied at fourth place, while Canada ranked fifth.</P>
      <P>The top five developed FDI suppliers were the United States,
Britain, Germany, France and Japan in descending order.</P>
      <P>Among developing economies, the top five FDI recipients were

      <P>Between 1995 and 1996, the United States and mainland China
absorbed one-third of the global FDI capital, while the FDI capital
flowing out of the United States and Britain accounted for 40 percent
of the total.</P>
      <P>The report said developing countries in Asia will be the most
attractive investment destinations for multinational business groups
over the next five years.</P>
      <P>Economics Ministry officials said Asian countries attracted 85
percent of total overseas investments by Taiwan companies as of June
this year. "This indicates that local businesspeople's investment
activities are consistent with the general world trend," an official

      <P>Mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin came
face to face with some of his harshest critics Thursday as he met
with members of the US Congress, the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.
(CBC) reported.</P>
      <P>The confrontation came a day after Jiang and US President Bill
Clinton sparred over human rights.</P>
      <P>Jiang said that since mainland China opened to the world in the
1970s, "the Chinese people have enjoyed a much better life, and it
has intensified efforts to improve democracy and the legal system."</P>
      <P>US House Speaker Newt Gingrich called the frank encounter an
"encouraging dialogue" that will create a "framework for a peaceful
evolution" of relations between the United States and mainland China.</P>
      <P>He said Jiang invited him to visit Tibet. "I reminded our Chinese
guests that you cannot have economic freedom without political
freedom, and you cannot have political freedom without religious
freedom," Gingrich was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>Jiang was not met by protesters on the Capitol Hill, according to

    <TEXT>
      <P>US House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.)
said Thursday he believes that after a meeting with members of the US
Congress in the Capitol, President Jiang Zemin of mainland China now
has a clear understanding of the US position that Beijing should not
use force against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Briefing the press at a stakeout in a hallway of the Capitol
building about a breakfast meeting between Jiang and some 50 members
of Congress, Gingrich said, "I do think they understand clearly our
commitment to Taiwan not being coerced militarily."</P>
      <P>Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.), who hosted the
breakfast, termed the one-hour meeting with Jiang as "excellent." He
said he had never attended a meeting with the leader of another
country where members of Congress were "more candid and more
succinct" in their comments and questions.</P>
      <P>"We touched on every important issue that has been raised
before," he said.</P>
      <P>More than 10 Republicans and Democrats from both the Senate and
the House of Representatives asked questions about mainland China's
human rights violations, religious persecution, coercive abortion
policy, nuclear proliferation and repression in Tibet. Jiang gave his
answers en bloc.</P>
      <P>Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), a critic of Beijing's human rights
abuses since the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown, said Jiang's responses to
the questions were "evasive." For example, on the issue of forced
abortion, Jiang said his country is so large that there may be a case
or two, but he does know about it.</P>
      <P>Jiang also denied there is religious persecution in mainland
China and Tibet. He talked about how he goes to religious festivals
and meets with religious leaders to prove there is religious freedom
in his country.</P>
      <P>Pelosi said she was "most disappointed" at Jiang's response to
the proliferation issue. He referred the question to his Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen, who said that Beijing has never been engaged in
the proliferation of nuclear technology.</P>
      <P>Senate Minority leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) had the impression
that some of Jiang's answers were candid, some were "less complete
and evasive clearly."</P>
      <P>Daschle pointed out that those members of Congress -- both
Democrats and Republicans -- who attended the breakfast were united
and spoke with one voice to Jiang.</P>
      <P>"I think it's clear he left here with a clear understanding of
the importance, the consequence and the significance that we put to
these issues. He got it from the president, and now he got it from
the Congress."</P>

    <HEADLINE>HUMAN RIGHTS TRANSCEND CULTURAL DIFFERENCES: MP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Oct.  30  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Canadian member of parliament said
Thursday that human rights transcend cultural differences and that
the regime in Beijing has to understand that human rights and
commerce are "the two halves of the same quote."</P>
      <P>Keith Martin (B.C.-Reform) noted that "without good human rights,
you don't maximize your commerce and without commerce, you don't have
adequate human rights." In order to have an environment in which
commerce can take place effectively, you need good human rights, he
said.</P>
      <P>Commenting on mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin's
intransigence on the human rights question at a White House press
conference Wednesday, Martin said he suspects the Chinese leadership
feels that to yield on that issue "might be a threat to their power
base."</P>
      <P>He proposed that Canada should work cooperatively with mainland
China and other countries in order to improve the human rights
situation around the world.</P>
      <P>On Jiang's statement that Beijing wants to resolve the Taiwan
issue peacefully but reserves the right to use force in the event the
island opts for independence, Martin commented: "You can't have it
both ways."</P>
      <P>The Chinese position that Taiwan is purely a domestic issue,
"belies a fear factor" that the rest of the world might be against
their instincts to save face and to issue threats, he pointed out. So
they take a very aggressive stance, he added.</P>
      <P>"We have to break down that fear factor," whether in dealing with
North Korea or China, because nothing is going to the table to be
negotiated and nothing is going to be resolved if they keep using
threats or forceful language, said the MP.</P>
      <P>He said the Canadian government should "get involved" in the
Taiwan-China dispute more actively. Ottawa voiced its concerns when
the missile crisis was escalating in the run up to Taiwan's first
presidential election in the spring of 1996.</P>
      <P>Martin said he will present a private member's bill to the
parliament in about two weeks urging the government to take a
"preventive" measure on the foreign policy front.</P>
      <P>In regard to the future of Taiwan, he is for a democratic process
in which the people there can freely and openly express their views
and make their own choices.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DIFFERENCES REMAIN  BETWEEN US, CHINA ON KEY ISSUES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct.  31  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite a significant agreement on
nuclear nonproliferation between US President Bill Clinton and his
Chinese counterpart, Jiang Zemin, following their summit in
Washington, huge differences remain between Washington and Beijing on
Taiwan, Tibet and human rights issues.</P>
      <P>In an editorial headlined "China Flexes Muscles on World Stage,"
mass-circulation newspaper The Australian on Friday said Jiang Zemin
has been received in Washington with all the panoply of official
homage he demanded as a world leader meeting one of his counterparts.</P>
      <P>"But the pomp and circumstances surrounding the visit cannot
disguise two fundamentals: It is ultimate irrelevant to China's
president what his people think of the visit and that for US
President Bill Clinton, his newfound interest in a constructive
engagement with China in the US," the editorial says.</P>
      <P>The editorial says Clinton's warning to Jiang not to minimize the
big differences that remain between the two countries concerning
human rights was directed at the US Congress and not the Chinese
people.</P>
      <P>"(US) Republicans are opposed to closer links with China until
they perceive some action from the Chinese authorities to accept an
American view on Taiwan, Tibet and Tiananmen Square. They will get no
joy from Mr. Jiang who maintains all these issues are internal
matters which China will handle in its own way and in its own good
time," the editorial says.</P>
      <P>Despite such huge differences on these issues, the editorial says
Jiang's visit to the United States should not "be downplayed."</P>
      <P>"The commitment of the two leaders to hold regular summits as
part of the progress towards a 'strategic partnership' cannot be
anything other than a major plus for world peace. Particularly when
the major flashpoint in our region is the Korean Peninsula, it is
important for the US and China should have some framework in which
each other's position can be discussed and it is to be hoped,
understood. It is in no country's interest -- least of all a trading
partner such as Australia -- that a Korean conflict develop."</P>
      <P>The editorial says the agreement on "nuclear issues --
specifically after China pledged to impose tighter export controls on
nuclear weapons technology -- is probably the most significant
outcome of the lengthy US-China discussions which led to the
Clinton-Jiang meeting."</P>
      <P>The editorial says: "Any improvement in US-China relations can
only benefit Australia in the long term, even if they put under
question the need for such established links as the ANZUS agreement,
China is confident it will be a major world influence. It would be
better if it were to do so in cooperation with the US, not in
conflict."</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA TO PUSH FOR FASTER FREE TRADE AMONG APEC COUNTRIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct.  31  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia will play a leading role in
pushing for a faster freeing-up of regional trade in food, energy and
metal products at the November meeting of Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) leaders in Vancouver, Australian Trade Minister
Tim Fischer said.</P>
      <P>Fischer said the focus has shifted to the prospects for early
liberalization in key sectors which show some promise for exporters
and away from the progress of individual countries toward APEC's
broader free trade goals.</P>
      <P>In 1994, APEC leaders agreed that less developed countries would
eliminate trade barriers by the year 2020 and the developed members
by 2010.</P>
      <P>But APEC is being seen as a regional platform for developing
sector-by-sector free trade agreements which could then be broadened
into global agreements through the World Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>Fischer said the new focus on energy, food and metal products is
the result of the APEC decision to support the US-sponsored proposal
for a free trade agreement on information technology, which was
subsequently taken up by the WTO.</P>
      <P>APEC has 18 members, including the United States, Canada, Mexico,
Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, mainland China, Hong Kong and other
countries in Southeast Asia.</P>
      <P>Fischer said Australia's priorities at the Vancouver meeting
would be food, energy and non-ferrous metals, but it would also
actively support other countries' proposals relating to chemicals,
environment services and fish.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Australian stock market took a
beating Friday morning after a plunge on Wall Street Thursday and
analysts predicted the market will remain jittery with nervous
investors sidelined.</P>
      <P>The All Ordinaries Index dropped 34 points in the first hour of
morning trading to 2402. The index fell 6.9 points to close at 2436.1
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Analysts attributed the fall in Australian share prices to the
plunge of 125 points on Wall Street, which closed at 7831 Thursday.</P>
      <P>But the Australian dollar edged up to 69.95 US cents in Friday
morning's trading from Thursday's closing level of 69.86 US cents.</P>
      <P>Analysts said major Asian share markets plunged due to sell-offs
by investors, causing tensions on the Australian share market
Thursday.</P>
      <P>They said the strong rebound on Wall Street and Hong Kong on
Thursday was short-lived because the "demons have not been
exorcised," meaning the financial crisis remains serious in Thailand

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING GAINS SYMBOLIC TRIUMPH AT SUMMIT -- AT A PRICE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Oct.  31 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The joint statement that resulted from
the summit between US President Bill Clinton and mainland Chinese
President Jiang Zemin confirmed the impression of many observers that
Beijing got more symbolism than substance from the summit, while
Washington, by granting symbolism, derived more substance in return,
The Straits Times reported Friday in a dispatch from Washington.</P>
      <P>The symbolism of a state visit -- 21-gun salute, red-carpet
welcome, state banquet in the White House and National Symphony
Orchestra concert on the White House lawn -- was important to
Beijing.</P>
      <P>US reluctance to provide such pomp and circumstance is what held
back this summit for two years, the report said.</P>
      <P>With this symbolism accorded, Beijing was willing to reciprocate
US courtesy by accepting most of the demands of the Clinton
administration, the daily said.</P>
      <P>In almost every aspect of bilateral relations, there are
important objectives that Beijing failed to achieve, the report
pointed out.</P>
      <P>On the Taiwan issue, which is central to US-mainland Chinese
relations, both parties merely reiterated their long-standing
differences without making any headway. Beijing's wish for a fourth
joint communique fell through, the report said.</P>
      <P>Even the minimal request for the cessation of US sales, transfers
and leases of advanced weapons to Taiwan was met with a resounding
"no", it noted.</P>
      <P>The other hope of Beijing to persuade Washington to turn its deep
involvement in the Taiwan issue into a "positive factor" by getting
Taipei to enter reunification talks with mainland China also failed
to materialize, the report pointed out.</P>
      <P>On security issues, Beijing has been seeking greater transparency
in the US-Japan defense guidelines. Again, it failed to extract any
American reassurances on the matter.</P>
      <P>Mainland China is also seeking an agreement of "no first use" of
nuclear weapons between it and the United States. It has already
signed such an agreement with Russia. Considering the compromises
Beijing already made by joining the Non-Proliferation Treaty and the
Zangger Commission, its failure to obtain an American assurance is
startling, the report said.</P>
      <P>On trade and economic issues, a number of US sanctions imposed on
mainland China following the 1989 Tiananmen incident have been
lifted. But a few, such as those covering banking and finance, are
still in place.</P>
      <P>Similarly, the report pointed out, mainland China made no headway
on its preference for a once-and-for-all most-favored-nation trading
status, rather than the current annual review.</P>
      <P>On mainland China's entry into the World Trade Organization, the
joint statement merely stated US interest in seeing Beijing become a
member.</P>
      <P>On the US government's pet topic of human rights, Jiang failed to
convince Clinton to respect the mainland Chinese way of doing things,
the report said.</P>
      <P>Conversely, Washington had it pretty good with an impressive list
of achievements, including agreement on military contacts, Beijing's
cooperation in solving the Korean problem, environmental protection
and control of weapons of mass destruction.</P>
      <P>While symbolism is important, Beijing should ask whether it
achieved that at too high a cost, the report concluded.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ATTENTION SHOULD TURN TO ASIA'S 'REAL ECONOMY': GOH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Oct.  31 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Asian currency and stock crisis is
nothing to be alarmed about, but attention should turn instead to the
real economy, Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said in
Copenhagen, Denmark on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Stating that the recent turmoil was ruled by market sentiment and
so had given rise to some uncertainty, he said, "But if we look at
the real economy -- hardworking population, savings rate, political
stability, investments -- we will be doing all right."</P>
      <P>Goh was giving his assessment of the situation at a press
conference with Danish and Singapore media on the last day of his
official visit in Denmark, The Straits Times reported Friday in a
dispatch from Copenhagen.</P>
      <P>On the currency readjustment, he pointed out that it was in fact
the growing strength of the US dollar that had led to a drop in value
of up to 40 percent for currencies in Southeast Asia and up to 15
percent in Europe.</P>
      <P>"There's a lot of vigor in the US economy, so in that sense,
those who have analyzed this quite calmly are not too alarmed," he
said.</P>
      <P>Similar crises had happened in recent years in Sweden, Mexico and
Britain, he noted, adding that the region would just have to ride out
this present turmoil.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the Asian currency shock is coming to an end, he
said: "When you drop a stone into the middle of a pool, you're going
to see strong ripples. The ripples are now reaching the periphery and
they are weakening.</P>
      <P>"I would say, give it a few weeks, maybe a few months, and the
currency will stabilize and we'll see a clearer picture."</P>
      <P>Asian currencies would settle at a lower level than before. "But
life goes on. The real economy is the most important factor," he
said.</P>
      <P>"Growth will be slightly slower, but nothing to be alarmed
about," he said.</P>
      <P>He said Singapore's exports would still remain competitive
against its neighbors because the country was not competing in the
same areas but in those with higher value added.</P>
      <P>Thailand might grow a little slower but Indonesia and Malaysia
would grow more robustly, he commented.</P>
      <P>Asked to give his view of how the crisis started, Goh said his
theory was that Thailand ran into trouble because it borrowed too
much offshore to invest at home.</P>
      <P>There was also an interest spread of 6 to 8 percent between its
borrowings in Thai baht and US dollars, which gave the market a
chance to test whether the baht was over-valued.</P>
      <P>Asked if he blamed international financier George Soros for the
crisis, Goh said he saw Soros as part of the market.</P>
      <P>In the present crisis, the market had over-corrected, he said.
"Once it swings one way, the herd instinct follows and it tends to go
too far. But after a while, the pendulum will come to a standstill."</P>

    <HEADLINE>US CONGRESS MEMBERS URGE JIANG TO RELEASE PRISONERS OF CONSCIENCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  30  (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Several members of the US Congress
urged mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin at a breakfast meeting
Thursday to release prisoners of conscience and allow political and
religious freedom in mainland China.</P>
      <P>At the breakfast meeting in the Capitol attended by more than 50
members of Congress, House Majority Leader Dick Armey presented Jiang
with a letter calling for the release of 30 people he said mainland
China is persecuting for their religious beliefs. He also gave Jiang
a list of the prisoners.</P>
      <P>"When you deny your citizens the most basic right of religious
liberty, that becomes the legitimate and urgent concern of free
people everywhere. Your policy of religious persecution is the
central obstacle to better relations with the United States and the
democratic world," Armey said in the letter.</P>
      <P>In remarks to Jiang at the breakfast, House Speaker Newt Gingrich
told the mainland Chinese leader, "You cannot have economic freedom
without political freedom, and you cannot have political freedom
without religious freedom."</P>
      <P>Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) urged Beijing to release Wei
Jingsheng, Wang Dan and other prisoners of conscience on a list she
presented to Jiang. She also relayed to Jiang a letter from Cardinal
Kung Pin-mei, the exiled bishop of Shanghai now living in
Connecticut, calling for the release of four bishops being detained
in labor camps and prisons in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Pelosi later told the press that Jiang denied that there is any
repression of the religious and human rights of his people. Jiang
also denied there is any repression in Tibet.</P>
      <P>"But despite his evasiveness and the duplicity of his government,
I believe the American people know the truth. They can see through
the barrage of lies," she said.</P>
      <P>A day earlier, Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy II (D-Mass.) also delivered
to Jiang a letter cosigned by more than 60 members of the House of
Representatives, urging him to release Wei Jingsheng and Wang Dan,
who are serving long jail sentences for peaceful expressions of their
political views.</P>
      <P>"An improvement in US-China relations certainly is important for
a variety of mutually beneficial economic and security reasons. But
if China continues to refuse to make progress on human rights, such
an improvement in relations will not occur," Kennedy said in the
letter.</P>

    <HEADLINE>10TH ANNIVERSARY OF CROSS-STRAIT PRIVATE EXCHANGES MARKED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  31  (CNA)
(By Debbie Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman
Chang King-yuh on Saturday presided over a ceremony kicking off an
exhibition of documents and photographs to mark the 10th anniversary
of Taiwan's opening of private exchanges with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Addressing the ceremony, Chang, the Republic of China's top
official in charge of formulating the government's policies on
mainland China, said Taipei has always kept the doors open to
cross-strait consultations, hoping Beijing authorities will return to
the negotiating table as soon as possible without setting any
preconditions.</P>
      <P>Reviewing the government's efforts in enhancing civilian
exchanges across the Taiwan Strait during the last decade, Chang said
Taipei will continue to follow the course in a "steadying the steps
so as to walk a long ways" manner.</P>
      <P>According to MAC tallies, since Nov. 2, 1987, when the government
here began to allow private individuals to travel to mainland China
to visit relatives, Taiwan residents have made more than 10 million
visits there.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, mainland people made some 220,000 visits to Taiwan for
cultural and academic activities or to settle here.</P>
      <P>In 10 years, two-way trade across the strait has amounted to
nearly US$120 billion, and the Chinese mainland has become Taiwan's
third largest trading partner in the world, trailing only the United
States and Japan.</P>
      <P>The two sides exchanged over 140 million letters and 360 million
phone calls during the last decade, which have undeniably helped to
diminish hostility and better understanding across the Taiwan Strait,
Chang said.</P>
      <P>To facilitate private exchanges with mainland China, the
government devised the Mainland Affairs Task Force under the
Executive Yuan in 1988 following the formal opening of private visits
to mainland China in November 1987.</P>
      <P>The task force was upgraded into the Mainland Affairs Council on
Oct. 18, 1990. One month later on Nov. 21 the semi-official Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) was established as an intermediary
organization to handle technical problems arising from increased
private exchanges across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The SEF has also since taken over some of the cross-strait
functions the ROC Red Cross Society began performing in 1987.</P>
      <P>Not longer after, Beijing set up the Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) as a counterpart to Taipei's SEF.</P>
      <P>Under joint SEF-ARATS efforts, the "Koo-Wang talks" were held in
Singapore in April 1993, marking the first and so far only high-level
cross-strait talks since the communists took control of the Chinese
mainland in 1949.</P>
      <P>The talks are so named because they were conducted by SEF
Chairman C.F. Koo and ARATS Chairman Wang Daohan.</P>
      <P>The top negotiators from both sides were originally scheduled to
meet again for a second-round of talks in the second half of 1995.
But Beijing unilaterally suspended the rendezvous after President Lee
Teng-hui's landmark visit to the United States in June that year.
Beijing also consequently closed other dialogue channels formulated
in the first Koo-Wang meeting.</P>

bilateral civilian exchanges.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DNA TEST CONFIRMS KIDNAP SUSPECT INVOLVED IN TRIPLE SLAYING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  31  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A DNA test has confirmed that a suspect
wanted for the kidnap and murder of the daughter of a local TV
actress was also involved in last week's slaying of a surgeon, his
wife and a nurse at the surgeon's plastic surgery clinic in Taipei,
according to the police.</P>
      <P>Comparing blood samples taken from the suspect's son with semen
found in the body of nurse Cheng Wen-yu, forensic scientists are
almost certain that the semen belongs to Chen Chin-hsing, the
notorious fugitive wanted for kidnapping and killing Pai Hsiao-yen in
April.</P>
      <P>Cheng, noted plastic surgeon Fang Pao-fang and his wife were
found dead on Oct. 23 by a cleaner at Fang's clinic. All three had
been killed with a single bullet to the head, while semen found in
Cheng's body suggested that she had also been raped or molested
before being killed.</P>
      <P>Although no motive has yet been established and no suspect has
been apprehended in the case thus far, police are of the opinion that
it was the work of Chen and his accomplice in the Pai kidnapping, Kao
Tien-ming.</P>
      <P>One theory postulates that the two fugitives, under pressure from
their months in hiding, forced Dr. Fang to alter their appearances by
surgery to escape the police dragnet, killing Fang and the other two
in the clinic immediately afterwards.</P>
      <P>Although police were able to collect a number of blood samples
from the crime scene, they were unable to ascertain which, if any,
belonged to either of the two suspects. Police therefore also took
blood samples from Chen's three-year-old son which they obtained from
a hospital which treated the child in August.</P>
      <P>Although the test results support the investigators' suspicions
that Chen was involved in the triple murder, a senior police official
leading the investigation said that without samples from Chen
himself, the DNA test results are no more than circumstantial
evidence which only suggests an avenue for investigation.</P>
      <P>Although a third accomplice in the Pai kidnapping, Lin
Chun-sheng, committed suicide on Aug. 19 after being cornered by
police in a chance encounter, Chen and Kao have eluded an intensive
police manhunt, escaping by the skin of their teeth on several
occasions.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HONG  KONG  HAS  SHOWN  UP MAINLAND CHINA'S WEAKNESSES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  Oct. 31 (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As Asia's financial markets and currencies
have unraveled over the past few months, mainland China has stood
apart from the turmoil, seemingly immune to the contagion that has
gripped the region, according to reports from the Geneva-based World
Trade Organization (WTO) on Friday.</P>
      <P>It may show some of the symptoms of its beleaguered neighbors --
an oversupplied property market, an indebted banking sector,
manufacturing industry squeezed by overcapacity and rising fixed
costs and an economy generally hampered by corruption and cronyism,
the WTO report said.</P>
      <P>But, in other respects, the WTO pointed out, mainland China is
different. The foreign capital inflows into the country are mostly
for long-term fixed investments, rather than short-term lending --
the "hot money" that destabilized countries such as Thailand.</P>
      <P>Foreign portfolio investment in mainland China is equivalent to
less than 0.5 percent of GDP and even the fledging foreign currency
stock markets are driven by local investors.</P>
      <P>Foreign commercial lending has grown, but with external debt of
around US$130 billion at the end of last year, mainland China's
debt-to-GNP ratio is 20 percent, among the lowest in Asia, the WTO
report said.</P>
      <P>Mainland China's currency is not yet convertible on the capital
account. The exchange rate remains strictly government-controlled and
defended by over US$130 billion in foreign exchange reserves.</P>
      <P>And in mainland China, where exports are soaring, sentiment
suggests the currency is, if anything, undervalued: "If they freed
the renminbi, it would appreciate," Brewer Stone, head of Prudential
Securities in Shanghai, was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>In short, foreign investors are hard put to mount an assault on
either mainland China's currency or its stock markets.</P>
      <P>However, the upheaval in Hong Kong last week has offered a
reminder of the weaknesses of the mainland Chinese economy and how
turbulence in Hong Kong, which is intimately involved in the reform
on the mainland, has implications for mainland China, according to
the WTO report.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MONTHLY PENSION FOR ELDERLY IN TAIPEI COUNTY IF KMT WINS COUNTY CHIEF ELECTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 31 (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui on Friday offered to
provide old people in Taipei County with a monthly pension, as part
of efforts to help his ruling Kuomintang (KMT) candidate win the
election for county chief on Nov. 29.</P>
      <P>Lee, in his capacity as KMT chairman, said during campaign
activities that people aged over 65 in Taipei County will receive a
NT$5,000 monthly pension if his party's candidate -- Hsieh Shen-shan
-- is elected magistrate of the county, which is currently under the
control of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>"I promise that old people in Taipei County will receive a
NT$5,000 pension every month," Lee said, adding that the pension will
be issued monthly, unlike the current situation in the county whereby
the elderly receive the pension "only three or four months" out of
each year.</P>
      <P>Pensions for the elderly was one of the DPP's major campaign
slogans in the last local elections, but after honoring their
campaign promises for a short time, most of the DPP-controlled cities
and counties halted the pension programs. However, Taipei County,
governed by You Chin, who is in his second term, is still carrying
out the program, at least for a few months of each year.</P>
      <P>Lee's remarks are being seen as a turnabout in the KMT's campaign
policy, as the party's cultural affairs department has recently
criticized the DPP's policy of promoting the pension system.</P>
      <P>If Hsieh wins the election and honors Lee's promise, it will cost
the Taipei County government an estimated NT$7 billion a year to pay
the monthly pensions to the approximately 115,000 elderly residents
of the county.</P>
